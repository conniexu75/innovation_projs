However, the molecular mechanisms underlying α-synuclein aggregation into such filamentous inclusions remain unknown. An intriguing aspect of this problem is that α-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein, with little or no ordered structure under physiological conditions. This raises the question of how an essentially disordered protein is transformed into highly organized fibrils. In the search for an answer to this question, we have investigated the effects of pH and temperature on the structural properties and fibrillation kinetics of human recombinant α-synuclein. Either a decrease in pH or an increase in temperature transformed α-synuclein into a partially folded conformation. The presence of this intermediate is strongly correlated with the enhanced formation of α-synuclein fibrils. We propose a model for the fibrillation of α-synuclein in which the first step is the conformational transformation of the natively unfolded protein into the aggregation-competent partially folded intermediate.

Parkinson's disease arises from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and is accompanied by the presence of intracellular inclusions, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (1Galvin J.E. Lee V.M. Schmidt M.L. Tu P.H. Iwatsubo T. Trojanowski J.Q. Adv. Neurol. 1999; 80: 313-324PubMed Google Scholar). Abundant Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the cerebral cortex are also pathological hallmarks of dementia with Lewy bodies, a common late-life dementia that is clinically similar to Alzheimer's disease (2Okazaki H. Lipkin L.E. Aronson S.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1961; 21: 422-449Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lewy bodies have been detected in the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (3Trojanowski J.Q. Goedert M. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Structurally, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are composed of filamentous and granular material (4Duffy P.E. Tennyson V.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1965; 24: 398-414Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the major component of which is α-synuclein (5Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M.

Two different missense mutations in the α-synuclein gene, corresponding to A53T and A30P substitutions, have been identified in two kindreds with autosomal dominantly inherited, early-onset Parkinson's disease (7Polymeropoulos M.H.

Thus, the accumulation of α-synuclein-derived fibrillar material represents a critical biomedical problem. α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein of unknown function that was first isolated from synaptic vesicles of Torpedo californicaand rat brain (13Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Purified human α-synuclein has been shown to be unstructured in aqueous solution and hence extremely heat-stable (15Weinreb P.H. Zhen W.G. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of α-synuclein is characterized by six imperfect repeats (consensus KTKEGV) within the N-terminal half of the polypeptide as well as by a highly acidic C-terminal region (14Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar,17Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the function of α-synuclein is unclear, it is predominantly concentrated in the cytosol and presynaptic nerve terminals of neurons, with some fractions associated with synaptic vesicle membranes (14Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 18George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

The repeat sequences in α-synuclein are predicted to form amphipathic helixes that can associate with lipid vesicles (18George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to bind to small synthetic unilamellar vesicles (21Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F.

Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that α-synuclein may regulate the size of presynaptic vesicular pools (24Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that α-synuclein may play a role in neurotransmission or in the organization and regulation of synaptic vesicles. The potential role of α-synuclein deposition in several neurodegenerative diseases has focused attention on this protein. The aggregation behavior of recombinant wild-type α-synuclein and its A30P and A53T mutants has been studied under in vitrophysiological conditions. It has been established that all three proteins, as well as the 1–87 and 1–120 truncated forms of recombinant α-synuclein, are able to assemble readily into filaments with morphologies and staining characteristics similar to those extracted from disease-affected brain (25Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 26Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, little is currently known about the structural basis for α-synuclein fibrillation. A major fundamental question concerns how the essentially disordered (“natively unfolded”) protein is transformed into the highly organized fibrils with characteristic crossed β-conformation. As a start to unravel the “mystery” of α-synuclein fibrillation, we describe the effects of pH and temperature on the structural and fibrillation properties of human α-synuclein. Since most aggregating protein systems probably involve a transient partially folded intermediate as the key precursor to fibrillation, we sought conditions that would be expected to favor such a conformation for α-synuclein. The natively unfolded character of α-synuclein arises from its low intrinsic hydrophobicity and high net charge at neutral pH (pI 4.7) (28Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Thus, conditions that decrease the net charge and that increase the hydrophobicity would be expected to result in partial folding. Acidic pH and elevated temperatures provide such conditions, respectively. The strong correlation observed between the degree of protein folding and the efficiency of its fibril formation suggests that the intermediate can be a precursor of fibrils. Although low pH and high temperature are unphysiological, they provide a useful model by increasing the concentration of the critical intermediate. Thioflavin T (ThT)1 and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were from Fisher. A new procedure for producing and purifying α-synuclein was developed by fusing its gene to a chitin-binding domain/intein system (IMPACT, New England Biolabs Inc.) and expressing the fusion protein in Escherichia coli. This system allowed simple purification of α-synuclein by binding of the chitin-binding domain fusion protein to a chitin column, followed by addition of a thiol agent (dithiothreitol or cysteine) to induce the cleavage reaction of the intein and to release the α-synuclein. The resultant protein, which was highly homogeneous upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was indistinguishable from authentic α-synuclein based on its electrophoretic mobility and molecular mass determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Solutions of 0.5 ml of α-synuclein at pH 7.5 in 20 mm Tris buffer or at pH 3.0 in 20 mmacetate buffer were stirred at 37 °C in glass vials with micro-stir bars. Protein concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. Fibril formation was monitored with thioflavin T fluorescence (29Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 30Naiki H. Higuchi K. Matsushima K. Shimada A. Chen W.H. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 768-773PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 μl were removed from the incubated sample and added to 1.0 ml of 25 μm ThT in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) (see below). The presence of fibrils was confirmed by electron microscopy (negative staining with uranyl acetate) and atomic force microscopy. The kinetics of α-synuclein fibril formation could be described as sigmoidal curves defined by an initial lag phase, in which a negligible change in ThT fluorescence intensity was observed; a subsequent exponential growth phase, in which ThT fluorescence increased; and a final equilibrium phase, in which ThT fluorescence reached a plateau, indicating the end of fibril formation. ThT fluorescence measurements were plotted as a function of time and fitted to a curve described by Equation 1, Y=(yi+mix)+(vf+mfx)1+ex−xoτEquation 1 where Y is the fluorescence intensity andxo is the time to 50% of maximal fluorescence. The initial base line during the lag phase is described byyi + mi x. The final base line after the growth phase had ended is described byyf +mf x. The apparent first-order rate constant (kapp) for the growth of fibrils is calculated as 1/τ, and the lag time is calculated asxo − 2τ. This expression is unrelated to the underlying molecular events, but provides a convenient method for comparison of the kinetics of fibrillation. CD spectra were obtained with an Aviv 60DS spectrophotometer using an α-synuclein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Spectra were recorded in a 0.01-cm cell from 250 to 190 nm with a step size of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and an averaging time of 10 s. For all spectra, an average of five scans was obtained. CD spectra of the appropriate buffers were recorded and subtracted from the protein spectra. Fluorescence measurements were performed in semimicro-quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with a 1-cm excitation light path using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (Instruments S. A., Inc.). ThT fluorescence was recorded immediately after addition of the aliquots to the ThT mixture from 470 to 560 nm with excitation at 450 nm, an increment of 1 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and slits of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. For each sample, the signal was obtained as the ThT intensity at 482 nm from which was subtracted a blank measurement recorded prior to addition of α-synuclein to the ThT solution. ANS emission spectra were recorded from 460 to 600 nm with excitation at 350 nm, an increment of 1 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and slits of 5 nm for both excitation and emission. All data were processed using DataMax/GRAMS software. Attenuated total reflectance data were collected on a Nicolet 800SX FTIR spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. The internal reflectance element (72 × 10 × 6 mm, 45° germanium trapezoid) was held in a modified SPECAC out-of-compartment attenuated total reflectance apparatus. The hydrated thin films were prepared as described previously (31Oberg K. Chrunyk B.A. Wetzel R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2628-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Typically, 1024 interferograms were co-added at 4-cm−1 resolution. Data analysis was performed with GRAMS32 (Galactic Industries Corp.). Secondary structure content was determined from curve fitting to spectra deconvoluted using second derivatives and Fourier self-deconvolution to identify component band positions. Hydrated thin film samples were prepared by drying 50 μl of 1 mg/ml α-synuclein solution on a ZnSe crystal with dry N2. The IR spectra were collected, followed by Fourier transformation using the spectrum of the clean crystal as a background. Water (liquid and vapor) components were subtracted from the protein spectrum. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were made using Beam Line 4-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (33Wakatsuki S. Hodgson K.O. Eliezer D. Rice M. Hubbard S. Gillis N. Doniach S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1992; 63: 1736-1740Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). X-ray energy was selected at 8980 eV (copper edge) by a pair of Mo/B4C multilayer monochromator crystals (34Tsuruta H. Brennan S. Rek Z.U. Irving T.C. Tompkins W.H. Hodgson K.O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 672-682Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Scattering patterns were recorded by a linear position-sensitive proportional counter, which was filled with an 80% xenon and 20% CO2 gas mixture. Scattering patterns were normalized by incident x-ray fluctuations, which were measured with a short length ion chamber before the sample. The sample-to-detector distance was calibrated to be 230 cm using a cholesterol myristate sample. The measurements were performed in a 1.3-mm path length observation static cell with 25-μm mica windows. To avoid radiation damage of the sample in SAXS measurements, the protein solution was continuously passed through a 1.3-mm path length observation flow cell with 25-μm mica windows. Background measurements were performed before and after each protein measurement and then averaged before being used for background subtraction. All SAXS measurements were performed at 23 ± 1 °C. The radius of gyration (Rg) was calculated according to the Guinier approximation (35Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press Ltd., London1982Google Scholar), ln I(Q) = ln(0) −Rg2/Q 2/3, whereQ is the scattering vector given by Q = (4π sinθ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of x-ray. I(0), the forward scattering amplitude, is proportional ton·ρc2·V 2, where n is the number of scatterers (protein molecules) in solution, ρc is the electron density difference between the scatterer and the solvent, and V is the volume of the scatter. This means that the value of forward scattered intensity,I(0), is proportional to the square of the molecular mass of the molecule (35Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press Ltd., London1982Google Scholar). Thus, I(0) for a pure n-mer sample will therefore be n-fold that for a sample with the same number of monomers since each n-mer will scattern 2 times as strongly as monomer; but in this case, the number of scattered particles (n-mers) will ben times less than that in the pure monomer sample. On the one hand, as noted, α-synuclein belongs to the class of natively unfolded proteins, which have little or no ordered structure in the purified state under physiological conditions (15Weinreb P.H. Zhen W.G. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar); and on the other, it forms fibrils of highly organized secondary structure. For example, x-ray diffraction analysis of α-synuclein fibrils shows the characteristic pattern of a crossed β-sheet structure, in which the β-strands lie perpendicular to the long fiber axis, typical of all amyloid fibrils (27Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy analysis indicates that human α-synuclein filaments are typically 6–9 nm in width and several microns long (27Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Clearly, within the fibril, α-synuclein cannot be present as an extended linear polymer since, in a fully extended conformation, the maximal linear dimension of a polypeptide withn residues is n × 3.63 Å (36Creighton T.E. Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993Google Scholar). This gives ∼51 nm for α-synuclein, which is at least five times greater than the diameter of the filament. A fundamental question is what forces or factors will cause a natively unfolded protein to fold. It has been shown that natively unfolded proteins are characterized by a unique combination of low overall hydrophobicity and large net charge (28Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it is reasonable to suggest that any alterations in the protein environment leading to an increase in its hydrophobicity and/or a decrease in its net charge should be accompanied by at least partial folding of the intrinsically disordered protein. The overall hydrophobicity of a protein will increase with increasing temperature (the hydrophobic interaction has the unusual property of increasing in magnitude at higher temperatures due to the large change in heat capacity with temperature and the complex thermodynamic properties associated with changes in water structure as the temperature increases) (37Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8069-8072Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), and the excess negative charge of α-synuclein at neutral pH (pI 4.7) would be neutralized at lower pH values. Thus, we can expect partial folding of α-synuclein under conditions of high temperature and/or low pH. In contrast to an unfolded protein, a partially folded intermediate is anticipated to have contiguous hydrophobic patches on its surface, which are likely to foster self-association and hence potentially fibrillation. The advantages of using high temperatures or lower pH are that these conditions are anticipated to dramatically increase the population of putative partially folded intermediates, thus making it easier to characterize them. Such intermediates will be in equilibrium with the natively unfolded conformation and presumably are not populated significantly under normal physiological conditions. Fig.1 A represents the far-UV CD spectra of human recombinant α-synuclein measured at different pH values at 20 °C. At neutral pH, the protein possesses a far-UV CD spectrum typical of an essentially unfolded polypeptide chain. The spectrum has an intense minimum in the vicinity of 196 nm, with the absence of characteristic bands in the 210–230 nm region. However, as the pH was decreased, changes were observed in the shape of the spectrum. Fig. 1 shows that the minimum at 196 nm became less intense, whereas the negative intensity of the spectrum around 222 nm increased, reflecting pH-induced formation of secondary structure. The pH dependence of [θ]222 is shown in Fig. 1 B. There was little change in the far-UV CD spectrum between pH ∼9.0 and ∼5.5. However, a decrease in pH from 5.5 to 3.0 resulted in a ∼2-fold increase in negative intensity in the vicinity of 220 nm, and a further decrease in pH was accompanied by a reversal in the spectral intensity. Fig. 1 B shows that the pH-induced changes in the far-UV CD spectrum of α-synuclein were completely reversible (compareopen and closed symbols) and were independent of protein concentration (at least in the range of 0.1–1.5 mg/ml) (compare circles and squares). These observations are consistent with the assumption that the pH-induced increase in the structure of α-synuclein represents an intramolecular process and not self-association. Based on additional structural probes, described below, we interpret these far-UV CD changes to reflect the formation of a partially folded intermediate with significant β-structure. The fact that the far-UV CD spectra of α-synuclein as a function of pH show an isosbestic point (Fig. 1 A) indicates that the transition is a two-state one, presumably between the natively unfolded state and the partially folded intermediate conformation. The question arises as to whether these spectral changes correspond to a small fraction of the total protein being in the intermediate conformation, in which case the intermediate has a large negative ellipticity in the vicinity of 220 nm, or whether essentially all the molecules are present as the intermediate, in which case it has a small ellipticity at 220 nm. Based on the small angle x-ray scattering results (see below), we can conclude that the majority of the molecules are in the same conformation, and thus, the intermediate possesses limited secondary structure. Changes in ANS fluorescence are frequently used to detect non-native partially folded conformations of globular proteins (38Rodionova N.A. Semisotnov G.V. Kutyshenko V.P. Uverskii V.N. Bolotina I.A. Mol. Biol. ( Mosc. ). 1989; 23: 683-692PubMed Google Scholar, 39Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 40Fink A.L. Creighton T.E. The Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 140-142Google Scholar). This is because such intermediates are characterized by the presence of solvent-exposed hydrophobic clusters to which ANS binds, resulting in a considerable increase in the ANS fluorescence intensity and in a pronounced blue shift of the fluorescence emission maximum. Fig. 1 shows that, in the case of α-synuclein, a decrease in pH led to a large blue shift of the ANS fluorescence maximum (from ∼515 to ∼475 nm) (Fig. 1 B, open triangles), reflecting the pH-induced transformation from the natively unfolded state to the partially folded compact conformation. The transition from unfolded to partially folded conformation took place between pH 5.5 and 3.0 and was completely reversible (open and closed symbols). Fig. 1 B shows that the pH-induced structural transitions observed by ANS fluorescence and CD ellipticity changed simultaneously in a rather cooperative manner. This means that protonation of α-synuclein results in transformation of the natively unfolded protein into a conformation with a significant amount of ordered secondary structure and with affinity for ANS. The position of the transition indicates that protonation of one or more carboxylates was responsible for the structural change. Further investigations were devoted to the structural characterization of this conformation. FTIR represents a powerful method for the investigation of protein secondary structure. The main advantage of this approach in comparison with CD is that FTIR is much more sensitive to β-structure. To work with low protein concentrations, we used attenuated total reflectance FTIR and hydrated thin films of the sample (31Oberg K. Chrunyk B.A. Wetzel R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2628-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows the FTIR (amide I region) spectra of α-synuclein measured at pH 7.5 and 3.0. The spectrum of α-synuclein fibrils is also presented for comparison. The FTIR spectrum of α-synuclein at pH 7.5 is typical of a substantially unfolded polypeptide chain, whereas a decrease in pH led to significant spectral changes, indicative of increased ordered structure. The most evident change was the appearance of a new band in the vicinity of 1626 cm−1, which corresponds to β-sheet. This means that, at acidic pH, natively unfolded α-synuclein is transformed into a partially folded conformation with a significant amount of β-structure. As expected, the FTIR spectrum of α-synuclein fibrils shows the major contribution from β-sheet. Fourier self-deconvolution (and second derivative) of the FTIR spectra followed by curve fitting revealed the differences in the secondary structure in the different conformations. These results are summarized in Table I. Based on the SAXS experiments (below), the protein is monomeric at pH 3, and thus, the increased β-structure is not due to association-induced β-sheet.Table ISecondary structure content of human α-synuclein determined by FTIR under different experimental conditionsStructural assignmentpH 7.5pH 3.0Fibrils, pH 7.5Wave number%Wave number%Wave number%cm−1cm−1cm−1Turn16882.916872.616843.0Turn167318.5167218.3166618.5Loops/disordered165538.3165623.4Disordered/extended164024.7164231.1164824.0β-Sheet162615.6162424.3162947.1 Open table in a new tab SAXS is a very useful method for the investigation of conformation, shape, and dimensions of biopolymers in solution.

For a native globular protein, this plot has a characteristic maximum, whereas unfolded and partially folded polypeptides have significantly different-shaped Kratky plots. Guinier analysis of scattering data shows that, at neutral pH, α-synuclein is characterized by an Rg of 40 ± 1 Å (Fig. 3 A). At low pH, this parameter decreases to 30 ± 1 Å at pH 3.0, reflecting considerable compaction of the protein, corresponding to a volume decrease of 2.4-fold. The linear Guinier plots indicate that the solutions are homogeneous, suggesting that, at pH 3, essentially all the molecules of α-synuclein have the intermediate conformation, rather than a small fraction. It is interesting to compare measuredRg values with those calculated for the fully globular and rando"
https://openalex.org/W2113319670,"ABSTRACT Spasticity is a complicating sign in multiple sclerosis that also develops in a model of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CREAE) in mice. In areas associated with nerve damage, increased levels of the endocannabinoids, anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA) and 2‐arachidonoyl glycerol (2‐AG), and of the AEA congener, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), were detected here, whereas comparable levels of these compounds were found in normal and non‐spastic CREAE mice. While exogenously administered endocannabinoids and PEA ameliorate spasticity, selective inhibitors of endocannabinoid re‐uptake and hydrolysis—probably through the enhancement of endogenous levels of AEA, and, possibly, 2‐arachidonoyl glycerol—significantly ameliorated spasticity to an extent comparable with that observed previously with potent cannabinoid receptor agonists. These studies provide definitive evidence for the tonic control of spasticity by the endocannabinoid system and open new horizons to therapy of multiple sclerosis, and other neuromuscular diseases, based on agents modulating endocannabinoid levels and action, which exhibit little psychotropic activity."

Following the recent identification of the β-secretase β-amyloid-converting enzyme (BACE), we herein investigate its zymogen processing, molecular properties, and cellular trafficking. Our data show that among the proprotein convertase family members, furin is the major converting enzyme of pro-BACE into BACE within the trans-Golgi network of HK293 cells. While we demonstrate that the 24-amino acid prosegment is required for the efficient exit of pro-BACE from the endoplasmic reticulum, it may not play a strong inhibitory role since we observe that pro-BACE can produce significant quantities of the Swedish mutant βAPPsw β-secretase product C99. BACE is palmitoylated at three Cys residues within its transmembrane/cytosolic tail and is sulfated at mature N-glycosylated moieties. Data with three different antibodies show that a small fraction of membrane-bound BACE is shed into the medium and that the extent of ectodomain shedding is palmitoylation-dependent. Overexpression of full-length BACE causes a significant increase in the production of C99 and a decrease in the α-secretase product APPsα. Although there is little increase in the generation of Aβ by full-length BACE, overexpression of either a soluble form of BACE (equivalent to the shed form) or one lacking the prosegment leads to enhanced Aβ levels. These findings suggest that the shedding of BACE may play a role in the amyloidogenic processing of βAPP.

Among the cellular mechanisms contributing to this pathology are two types of fibrous protein deposition in the brain, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles consisting of polymerized tau protein, and abundant extracellular fibrils largely composed of β-amyloid1 (for reviews see Refs. 1Selkoe D.J.

The cellular toxicity and amyloid-forming capacity of the two major forms of Aβ (Aβ40 and especially Aβ42) have been well documented (1Selkoe D.J. Science. 1997; 275: 630-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 2Näslund J. Haroutunian V. Mohs R. Davis K.L. Davies P. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Am. Med.

An alternative, anti-amyloidogenic cleavage carried out by α-secretase(s) is located within the Aβ peptide sequence of βAPP, thus precluding the formation of intact insoluble Aβ. This cleavage by α-secretase within the (His-His-Gln-Lys↓Leu-Val) sequence of βAPP is the major physiological route of APP maturation. The products of this reaction are a soluble 100–120-kDa N-terminal fragment (βAPPsα) and a C-terminal membrane-bound ∼9-kDa segment (C83). In several recent reports, metalloproteinases such as ADAM9, -10, and –17 were shown to be involved in the α-secretase cleavage of βAPP (4Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.-N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L.

Enzymes within this family are typically synthesized as inactive zymogens that subsequently undergo prodomain cleavage and activation in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Evidence has been presented showing that several ADAMs are activated in a nonautocatalytic manner by other enzymes such as the proprotein convertases (PCs) (7Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that such enzymes may participate in a cascade leading to the activation of α-secretase. In support of this proposal, we recently demonstrated that inhibition of PC-like enzymes in HK293 cells by the α1-antitrypsin serpin variant α1-PDX (8Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) blocks the α-secretase cleavage of βAPPsw (9Lopez-Perez E. Seidah N.G. Checler F. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2056-2062PubMed Google Scholar). Correspondingly, overexpression of a PC (i.e. PC7) increased α-secretase activity. Of the previously mentioned candidate α-secretases, our ontogeny and tissue expression analyses suggest that, in adult human and/or mouse brain neurons, ADAM10 is a more plausible α-secretase than ADAM17 (10Marcinkiewicz M. Seidah N.G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The amyloidogenic pathway of βAPP processing begins with β-secretase(s). This enzyme generates the N terminus of Aβ by cleaving βAPP within the Glu-Val-Lys-Met-↓-Asp-Ala sequence, or by cleaving the Swedish mutant βAPPsw within the Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-↓-Asp-Ala sequence. In addition, cleavage has been reported to occur within the Aβ sequence Asp-Ser-Gly-Tyr10-↓-Glu11-Val, generating Aβ11–40/42 (11Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P.

Whereas in vitro cleavage specificity analyses of BACE and BACE2 did not reveal clear consensus recognition sequences (11Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burges T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M.

Comparative modeling of the three-dimensional structure of BACE complexed with a substrate suggested that BACE would preferentially cleave substrates having a negatively charged residue at P1′ and a hydrophobic residue at P1 (16Sauder J.M. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In fact, this is the case for the β-secretase sites in βAPP and βAPPsw as well as for the site leading to the formation of the Aβ11–40 peptide. Both BACE and BACE2 are type I membrane-bound proteins with a prodomain that, at least for BACE (12Hussain I. Powell D. Howwlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M. Smith T.S. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), is rapidly cleaved intracellularly. However, little else is known about the mechanism of zymogen processing of these enzymes, including whether their activation is autocatalytic or carried out by other enzymes. Recent data derived from BACE overexpressed in bacteria (15Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) suggested that the zymogen processing of the Arg42-Leu-Pro-Arg45↓ site of the prosegment, which is reminiscent of PC-cleavage sites (7Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), is not autocatalytic; rather it is effected by another proteinase(s). Moreover, our developmental analysis of the comparative tissue expression of mouse BACE and BACE2 suggested that BACE, but not BACE2, is a good candidate β-secretase in the brain (10Marcinkiewicz M. Seidah N.G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The second step in the amyloidogenic pathway of βAPP maturation involves cleavages at the γ-secretase sites (Val-Val-↓-Ile-Ala-↓-Thr-Val) to generate either Aβ40or Aβ42. Recently, in neuronal N2a cells, Aβ40 was shown to be produced within the TGN and subsequently packaged into post-TGN secretory vesicles, suggesting that the TGN is the major intracellular compartment within which the Aβ40-specific γ-secretase is active (17Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B. Thinakaran G. Checler F. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although some insoluble, N-terminally truncated Aβx-42originates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Aβ40 and Aβ42 are formed primarily in the TGN. This compartment is composed of the major source of the constitutively secreted pool of Aβ that is deposited as extracellular amyloid plaques. Furthermore, the generation of either peptide requires that βAPP or its membrane-bound, β-secretase cleavage product C99, passes at least once through endosomal compartments (18Van Gassen G. Annaert W. Van Broeckhoven C. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, βAPP trafficking to or retention in particular cellular compartments may critically influence its processing. Although the identification of the γ-secretase(s) has not yet been conclusively established (18Van Gassen G. Annaert W. Van Broeckhoven C. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), some reports have suggested presenilins as candidates (19Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigate whether PCs are responsible for the cleavage of the prosegment of BACE, as well as the consequences of blocking this maturation. In addition, we examine several post-translational modifications of BACE and their possible influence on the processing of βAPP and the generation of amyloidogenic Aβ peptides. Full-length mouse BACE (mBACEF) was cloned from AtT20 cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Titan One-Tube, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the following nested sense (S) and antisense (AS) oligonucleotides: S1 = AAGCCACCACCACCCAGACTTAGG; S2 = CTCGAGCTATGGCCCCGGCGCTGCGCTG (XhoI site at 5′) and AS1 = GAGGGTCCTGAGGTGCTCTGG; AS2 = CCTCCTCACTTCAGCAGGGAGATG. The final product (1519 base pairs) was completely sequenced, matched with the published structure (11Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burges T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar), and then subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen). To detect recombinant BACEF, we added, in phase (by polymerase chain reaction), either a V5 (GKPIPNPLLGLDST; [BACEF]V5) or FLAG (DYKDDDDK; [BACEF]FG) epitope to the C-terminal amino acid of the cytosolic tail of mouse BACE. We also prepared a BACEF construct in pIRES2-EGFP (Invitrogen) in which the FLAG epitope was introduced just after the signal peptide cleavage site (giving the sequence … GMLPA↓DYKDDDDK–QGTHL … ) and the V5 epitope at the C terminus of the molecule [BACEF]FG/V5. Other BACE constructs were also prepared as follows: 1) an active site D93A mutant single- [BACEF-D93A]FG or double-tagged [BACEF-D93A]FG/V5; 2) a prosegment deletion mutant [BACEF-Δp]FG in which the signal peptide ending at Ala19 was fused directly to the sequence … Met-Leu-Pro-Ala19-↓-Glu46-Thr-Asp-Glu-Glu-; 3) a prosegment deletion mutant of the active site mutant [BACEF-Δp-D93A]FG; 4) PC cleavage site (42 R LP R 45, where boldface with underlines indicate sequence position of arginine) mutants [BACEF-R45A]FG as well as the double-tagged [BACEF-R42A]FG/V5 and [BACEF-R45A]FG/V5; and 5) cytosolic tail Cys mutants, including single [BACEF-C478A]FG, [BACEF-C482A]FG, [BACEF-C485A]FG, double [BACEF-C482A,C485A]FG, and triple [BACEF-C478A,C482A,C485A]FG Cys substitutions. Soluble forms of BACE (BACES) were also prepared by deleting the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail (CT), leaving the sequence … TDEST454 followed by a V5 epitope. These constructs included [BACES]V5, [BACES]FG/V5, [BACES-R42A]FG/V5, and [BACES-R45A]FG/V5. All transfections were done with 2–4 × 105 HK293 cells using Effectene (Qiagen) and a total of 1–1.5 μg of BACE construct cDNAs subcloned into the vector pIRES2-EGFP. Two days post-transfection, the cells were washed and then pulse-incubated for various times with either 200 μCi/ml [35S]Met; 400 μCi/ml Na2[35SO4], [3H]Leu, [3H]Arg, [3H]Ser; or 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (20van de Loo J.W.

Proprotein convertases were obtained from the media of BSC40 cells infected with vaccinia virus recombinants of either human furin, human PACE4, mouse PC5-A (29Decroly E. Wouters S. Dibello C.

Thus, in each incubation, we used the necessary volume of enzyme preparation required to generate a hydrolysis activity of 180 pmol of AMC released per h at 100 μm pERTKR-MCA. PC-mediated digestions of pro-BACES were carried out by preincubating identical aliquots 3In lieu of a precise analytical means of quantitating our pro-BACES/BACES preparations, we used identical aliquots of these HK293 preparations to ensure that the tubes within each incubation series received exactly the same starting quantity of pro-BACES. of pro-BACES/BACES-containing HK293 media with the appropriate volume of PC-containing BSC40 medium for 1–4 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 μl (adjusted to 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v)). PC activity-inhibited controls comprised identical incubations for 4 h along with 1 μm of the appropriate purified PC cognate prosegment (24Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J.

Western blot analyses of the reaction products were carried out following 10% SDS-PAGE using either the FG (1:1000 dilution) or V5-HRP (1:5000 dilution) monoclonal antibodies (Stratagene). The secondary antibody for FG consisted of anti-mouse HRP-coupled IgGs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The disappearance of the N-terminal FLAG epitope on the Western blot was taken to represent the degree of prosegment removal by the PCs. β-Secretase activity was evaluated using a 20-aa synthetic peptide (SW20) that spans the cleavage site (KTEEISEVNL↓DAEFRHDSGY) of βAPPsw. Reactions were carried out for 4–18 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of 50 mm NaOAc (pH 4.5), 10–30 μm of SW20, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin (to inhibit low levels of a non-β-secretase proteolytic activity). The digestion products were separated via reverse transcriptase-high pressure liquid chromatography using a 1%/min trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient (15–45%) on a C-18 column (Vydac). Peaks were quantitated according to their absorption values at 210 nm and were definitively identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectroscopy (Voyager/PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Digestions by PCs of the BACE maturation site-spanning peptide (LGLRLPR↓ETDEESEEPGRRG; pro-BACE-(39–58)) were carried out as described above for the pro-BACES/BACES Western blot preincubations (except in 100 μl), whereas digestions of this peptide by BACE were as for β-secretase activity determinations (either at pH 4.5 or 6.5). Incubations with the peptide comprising the entire prosegment of mBACE (THLGIRLPLRSGLAGPPLGLRLPR; pro-BACE-(22–45)) were carried out as described for the β-secretase activity measurements, first preincubating at either pH 4.5 or 6.5 with 10–30 μm of this peptide. Again, the digestion products were quantitated by reverse transcriptase-high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight-mass spectroscopic analyses. To characterize the biosynthetic pathway of BACE and its post-translational modifications, we first cloned the enzyme from the mouse corticotrophic cell line AtT20. The resultant, fully sequenced 1519-base pair product corresponded to the published mouse sequence (11Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). To detect membrane-bound pro-BACE or BACE, we used the V5 epitope at the C terminus of the cytosolic tail. Alternatively, we employed the N-terminal FLAG epitope (FG) immediately following the signal peptidase cleavage site to detect specifically pro-BACE. This double-tagged, full-length protein ([BACEF]FG/V5) was coexpressed in human kidney epithelial cells (HK293) either with a control (CTL) (brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) or α1-PDX cDNA. Two days after transfection, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met for 15 min (P15). They were then chased for 1 or 2 h in the presence or absence of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA), which promotes fusion of thecis-, medial, and trans-Golgi (but not the TGN) with the ER (31Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either FG or V5 monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). In the absence of BFA and α1-PDX at P15 (Fig. 1 A), the FG epitope reveals a 66-kDa pro-BACE form that is gradually transformed first into a 64-kDa (C1 h) and then into a minor 72-kDa (C2 h) pro-BACE form. The 72-kDa form is not visible in the presence of BFA, the major band appears at 63 kDa. In contrast, the 72-kDa form is greatly enriched in the presence of α1-PDX (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with endoglycosidases revealed that the 63- and 64-kDa pro-BACE forms are sensitive to both endoH and endoF, whereas the 72-kDa form is sensitive only to endoF (not shown). These data suggest that the 63- and 64-kDa bands represent immature (likely ER-resident),N-glycosylated pro-BACE, whereas the 72-kDa form represents maturely glycosylated pro-BACE. Only in the presence of α1-PDX does pro-BACE immunoreactivity accumulate in the Golgi apparatus. In immunoprecipitation experiments employing the V5 epitope, the 2-h chase period revealed mainly a 68-kDa band (Fig.1 C). In the presence of α1-PDX (Fig.1 D), we observed an accumulation of a 72-kDa protein reminiscent of pro-BACE (Fig. 1 C). An additional control, using wild-type α1-antitrypsin to replace of α1-PDX, gave the same results as the BDNF controls presented here (not shown). N-terminal radiosequencing (26Seidah"

Here, we investigate underlying mechanisms of this BMP-15 effect. Treatment with BMP-15 alone exerted no significant effect on the basal expression of mRNAs encoding steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme, P450 aromatase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, luteinization hormone receptor, and inhibin/activin subunits. However, BMP-15 markedly inhibited the FSH-induced increases in these messages. In striking contrast, BMP-15 did not change the forskolin-induced levels of these transcripts. Thus, the inhibitory effect of BMP-15 on FSH action must be upstream of cAMP signaling. We next examined changes in FSH receptor mRNA expression. Interestingly, BMP-15 severely reduced the levels of FSH receptor mRNA in both basal and FSH-stimulated cells. To determine whether this effect was at the level of FSH function, we investigated the effect of BMP-15 on FSH bioactivity. Consistent with the mRNA data, BMP-15 inhibited the biological response of FSH, but not that of forskolin. Based on these results, we propose that BMP-15 is an important determinant of FSH action through its ability to inhibit FSH receptor expression. Because FSH plays an essential role in follicle growth and development, our findings could have new implications for understanding how oocyte growth factors contribute to folliculogenesis.

The mechanism of FSH action involves the activation of specific genes in the GCs through the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A signaling pathway (5Steele G.S. Leung C.K. Adashi E.Y. Leung P.C.K.

Therefore, it is important to define the mechanisms involved in FSH action. There is a large body of evidence indicating that oocytes secrete factors that modulate FSH action. (11Eppig J.J.

Regarding function, we have recently reported that BMP-15 stimulates rat GC proliferation and selectively inhibits FSH-induced P4, but not E2, production (33Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This is the only evidence available to date concerning the function of the BMP-15 molecule. The potential physiological relevance of BMP-15 in vivo is beginning to emerge. A recent genetic study of a naturally occurring mutant in sheep termed Inverdale (FecXI) has provided evidence for an essential role of BMP-15 in folliculogenesis and fertility (34Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In the female homozygous FecXI mutants, follicular development arrests at the primary stage, resulting in infertility. This phenotype has been linked to a defect in the BMP-15 gene. By contrast, the heterozygotes exhibit increased ovulation rate and multiple pregnancies. Therefore, BMP-15 is associated with the mechanisms of infertility and super fertility in a dosage-sensitive manner (34Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). An important unanswered question is how BMP-15 regulates these physiological functions. The present study provides the evidence that BMP-15 inhibits major FSH actions that are obligatory for follicle development and ovulation by virtue of its ability to suppress FSH receptor (FSH-R) expression. The possible mechanism by which BMP-15 controls the ovulation rate is discussed. Ovine FSH (NIDDK-oFSH-S20) was provided by Dr. Parlow of the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (Rockville, MD). Diethylstilbestrol, forskolin, and 4-androstene-3,17-dione (androstenedione, substrate of P450arom) were purchased from Sigma and female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (23 day old) from Charles-River Lab. (Wilmington, MA). Recombinant human BMP-15 tagged with a FLAG-epitope (BMP-15) was produced by 293 cells and purified by anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as reported previously (33Otsuka F. Yao Z.

Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (23 days old) were implanted with silastic capsules containing 10 mg of diethylstilbestrol to increase GC number (3Erickson G.F. Mol. Cell.

After 4 days of diethylstilbestrol exposure, GCs were collected from the ovaries and cultured in serum-free McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and antibiotics as described previously (35Erickson G.F.

The animal protocols were approved by the University of California at San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. GCs (2 × 106 viable cells) were cultured in a six-well plate with 2 ml of McCoy's 5a medium containing one or a combination of the following: 10 ng/ml FSH, 100 ng/ml BMP-15, 10 μm forskolin. One-hundred nmandrostenedione was added to the culture medium as indicated. After 48 h culture, total RNA was extracted by guanidium acid-isothiocyanate-phenol-chlorform methods using TriZOL® (Life Technologies Inc.), quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm, and stored at −80 °C until assay.

The steady state levels of mRNA encoding StAR, P450scc, P450arom, and FSH-R (referred to “target” mRNA) were analyzed by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. Prior to PCR the internal control DNAs (∼340 base pairs) having target-specific primer pairs were generated by PCR as reported previously (45Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The extracted RNA (500 ng) was subjected to a RT reaction using a First-Strand cDNA Synthesis System (Life Technologies, Inc.) with random hexamer (2 ng/μl), reverse transcriptase (200 units), and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP; 0.5 mm) at 42 °C for 50 min, 70 °C for 10 min. The resultant simple strand cDNA was resuspended in 50 μl of water for competitive PCR. The linear portion of the relationship between target cDNAs and internal control DNAs was determined individually for all targets. For this, a fixed amount (20 ng) of cDNA derived from GCs treated with FSH was mixed with a series of 10-fold dilutions of the internal control DNA, and the target and the internal control DNAs were coamplified by PCR using a specific primer set for the individual target (Fig. 1). Competitive PCR was performed using MgCl2 (1.5 mm), dNTP (0.2 mm), and 2.5 units of Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) under the following conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Aliquots of PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, visualized after ethidium bromide staining, photographed, and scanned. The relative integrated density of each band was digitized by multiplying the absorbance of the surface area (NIH image 1.62). Finally, the ratios of the densitometric readings of the amplified target cDNA and internal control DNA were plotted on the ordinate against the serial 10-fold dilutions of internal control DNA on the abscissa (Fig. 1). After establishing the working ranges in which linear relationship existed, the following concentrations of the internal control DNA were selected: 10−9pm for StAR, 10−7 pmfor P450scc, 10−7 pm for P450arom, 10−4 pm for L19, 10−9 pm for FSH-R. For competitive PCR reactions, 2 μl each of these internal control samples were added to 20 ng of each cDNA sample. The resultant PCR products were quantified by densitometric scanning as described above. Control analysis was performed using L19 ribosomal protein primers as well. For the other targets such as LH-R, inhibin subunits, 3β-HSD, and 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD), semiquantitative PCR analysis was performed without internal control under the same condition, and the level of their PCR products were compared with that of L19 target. GCs (105 viable cells) were cultured in a 96-well plate with 200 μl of McCoy's 5a medium containing 100 nm androstenedione together with either 10 ng/ml FSH, 100 ng/ml BMP-15, and/or 10 μmforskolin. After 48 h, the levels of P4 and E2 in the media were measured by radioimmunoassay (33Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). All results shown are mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments, with triplicate determinations for each treatment. Differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance (StatView 5.0 software, Abacus Concept, Inc., Berkely, CA).p values < 0.01 were accepted as statistically significant. In previous experiments (33Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) we found that BMP-15 inhibits FSH-induced P4, but not E2, production by cultured rat GCs. To test the hypothesis that BMP-15 may be specifically involved in modulating the expression of steroidogenic genes in response to FSH stimulation, we analyzed mRNA levels for StAR, P450scc, and P450arom by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, treating GCs for 48 h with a saturating dose of BMP-15 had no effect on the steady state mRNA levels for StAR, P450scc, P450arom, and a housekeeping gene L19. Treatment with FSH markedly increased the mRNA levels for StAR, P450scc, and P450arom, whereas L19 mRNA levels were unchanged. BMP-15 inhibited FSH-stimulated StAR and P450scc mRNA levels by 60 and 70%, respectively, but had only a weak effect on P450arom mRNA levels in the presence of androstenedione. L19 mRNA levels showed no difference among four different treatments. Taken into consideration that StAR and P450scc are rate-limiting factors of P4 synthesis in GCs (46Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), the suppression of these gene expressions seems to be a major cause of the selective suppression of FSH-induced P4 production. We next investigated the effect of BMP-15 on forskolin-stimulated GC responses. As shown in Fig. 3, forskolin (10 μm) stimulated the levels of StAR, P450scc, and P450arom mRNAs similar to that seen with FSH. However, in striking contrast to the FSH results, BMP-15 failed to change the forskolin-induced mRNA levels of these steroidogenic factors. L19 mRNA levels had no change by the forskolin treatment regardless of the presence of BMP-15 among four groups. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of BMP-15 on FSH-induced StAR and P450scc mRNA expression is mediated by a pre-cAMP signaling event. The failure of BMP-15 to inhibit FSH-induced P450arom mRNA expression is paradoxical. Given that androgens can up-regulate FSH-induced P450arom gene activity (47Fitzpatrick S.L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 48Ghersevich S. Poutanen M. Tapanainen J. Vihko R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the androstenedione in the culture medium could explain this paradox. As seen in Fig. 4, FSH stimulated P450arom mRNA expression in the absence of androstenedione and importantly, this increase was significantly inhibited by BMP-15. As expected (see Fig. 3), the forskolin-induced P450arom expression was not changed by BMP-15 in the absence of androstenedione. The steady state mRNA levels of StAR, P450scc, and L19 were unaffected by androstenedione (data not shown). Thus, it is clear that in the absence of androstenedione, P450arom mRNA induced by FSH was also inhibited by BMP-15 at a site upstream of the cAMP signaling event. To investigate whether the BMP effect involves changes in FSH-R expression, we measured the mRNA levels for FSH-R by quantitative competitive PCR. First, we established a linear relationship between the expression of target FSH-R and internal control (Fig.5 A) and then selected 10−9 pm concentration of internal control to perform the competitive reactions. Control untreated cells expressed FSH-R mRNA spontaneously. Interestingly, the level of FSH-R mRNA in control cells was markedly reduced (80%) following treatment with BMP-15 (Fig. 5 B). FSH treatment increased FSH-R mRNA levels ∼2-fold, and this increase was completely abolished by cotreatment with BMP-15, actually decreasing the FSH-R mRNA to that seen with BMP-15 alone. Thus, both basal and FSH-induced FSH-R mRNA expression is negatively regulated by BMP-15. To determine whether BMP-15 modulates other FSH-dependent functions in GCs, we examined the possible role of BMP-15 in the regulation of LH-R, the inhibin subunits (α, βA, and βB), 3β-HSD, and 20α-HSD. As seen in Fig.6, FSH induced marked increases in the levels of mRNA for each of these end points, except for 20α-HSD. Although BMP-15 alone had no effect on the basal levels of these mRNAs, it totally abolished the stimulatory effects seen with FSH (Fig. 6). BMP-15, either alone or together with FSH, did not change the basal levels of 20α-HSD mRNA. As illustrated in Fig.7, forskolin induced the expression of high levels of the mRNAs encoding LH-R, inhibin α, βA and βB subunits, and 3β-HSD. Consistent with our earlier results with StAR, P450scc and P450arom, cotreatment with BMP-15 failed to alter the forskolin-induced expression of these mRNAs (Fig. 7).Figure 7Effect of BMP-15 on the indicated forskolin (10 μm)-induced biological responses in GCs. The experimental design is as described in the legend to Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether this BMP-15 inhibition was at the level of FSH function, we tested the effect of BMP-15 on FSH bioactivity, specifically, P4 and E2 production in the GCs. In agreement with our recent study (33Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), FSH-induced P4, but not E2, production was suppressed by BMP-15 (Fig.8). In contrast, the forskolin-induced steroidogenic responses were unaffected by BMP-15 (Fig. 8). These results fit our hypothesis that BMP-15 inhibits FSH action by suppressing functional FSH-R in GCs. In a recent study we showed that BMP-15 stimulates proliferation of rat GCs and negatively regulates FSH-induced P4, but not E2, production in vitro (33Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study was to begin to explore the molecular basis by which BMP-15 modulates FSH action. The major new findings of the present study are as follows. First BMP-15 reduced the steady state levels of mRNA induced by FSH, including StAR, P450scc, 3β-HSD, LH-R, inhibin/activin subunits, and FSH-R. These observations suggest that BMP-15 can act broadly to inhibit the expression of a large battery of genes induced by FSH. Accordingly, BMP-15 can be considered a negative regulator of the major actions of FSH in the rat ovary. Second, in striking contrast to the FSH action, BMP-15 did not affect the stimulation of this battery of mRNAs in response to forskolin. Therefore, one can conclude that BMP-15 exerts its inhibitory effect on FSH action upstream of cAMP signaling. Third, BMP-15 markedly decreased both the basal and FSH-induced increases in FSH-R mRNA. And fourth, FSH-induced, but not forskolin-induced, steroidogenesis was suppressed by BMP-15, a finding that is consistent with the decrease in FSH-R message. Based on these findings, we propose that the negative regulation of FSH-R expression is the primary cause of BMP-15 inhibition of FSH action. It is important to note, however, that because we did not measure FSH protein levels directly, we cannot exclude the possibility that BMP-15 might exert its effects by a mechanism other than reducing the number of FSH-R. The finding that BMP-15 is a negative regulator of FSH-R expression together with our earlier report that BMP-15 stimulates DNA synthesis (33Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) establishes the concept that oocyte-derived BMP-15 is functionally involved in regulating two major aspects of GC development, namely stimulating proliferation and inhibiting FSH-dependent cytodifferentiation. This suggests a role for BMP-15 in coordinating GC proliferation with FSH-dependent cytodifferentiation during follicle growth and development. Our observation that FSH stimulates the expression of FSH-R mRNA is consistent with the previous reports demonstrating that FSH itself increases FSH-R gene transcription and cell surface FSH receptors (49Minegishi T. Hirakawa T. Kishi H. Abe K. Abe Y. Mizutani T. Miyamoto K. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,50Tilly J.L. LaPolt P.S. Hsueh A.J.W. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrated that BMP-15 completely blocks this FSH effect. Therefore, we propose that BMP-15 is a determinant of FSH action by exerting inhibitory effects on FSH-R expression. It was found that BMP-15 does not inhibit the amplifying effect of androstenedione on FSH-stimulated P450arom mRNA expression. But, it did suppress the ability of FSH to induce P450arom in the absence of androstenedione. This is consistent with the failure of BMP-15 to inhibit FSH-induced E2 production in the presence of added androstenedione. The potential significance of this finding is unknown. In this regard, however, a fundamental principle in ovarian physiology is that FSH stimulates the expression of P450arom and E2production in the dominant follicle that contains a high concentration of androstenedione in the follicular fluid. Therefore, the finding that BMP-15 does not inhibit FSH-induced P450arom mRNA and E2 production in the presence of androstenedione may be physiologically relevant. Genetic and physiological studies in Inverdale (FecXI) sheep have identified a point mutation in the BMP-15 gene that has profound effects on follicle development and ovulation quota (34Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Homozygous FecXI mutant females are infertile because follicle growth is arrested at the primary preantral stage. Consequently there are no ovulations in these animals. This provides compelling evidence for a requirement of bioactive BMP-15 in follicle cell proliferation and differentiation in sheep (51Davis G.H. McEwan J.C. Fennessy P.F. Dodds K.G. McNatty K.P. O W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the heterozygous FecXI mutants exhibit increased ovulation rate. In this connection, several interesting abnormal features of the ovaries of the heterozygotes have been identified: (i) there are more healthy estrogenic follicles, ii) the number of GCs in these developing follicles is significantly smaller, iii) these GCs have a higher mean LH responsiveness at smaller follicle stages, and iv) the corpora lutea are smaller (52Shackell G.H. Hudson N.L. Heath D.A. Lun S. Shaw L. Condell L. Blay L.R. McNatty K.P. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The fact that the plasma FSH and LH levels in the heterozygotes are normal would imply that the mechanisms responsible for these unusual features in the heterozygote reside in the ovary. Our observation that BMP-15 inhibits FSH-R expression could explain the cause of the abnormal phenotype of the Inverdale ewe. In the heterozygotes, we propose that reduced levels of BMP-15 result in higher levels of FSH-R in the GCs, which in turn lead to more developing healthy estrogenic follicles with more LH-R. The end result of this sequence of events would be increased ovulation rate. At the opposite extreme, follicle development in the homozygotes is arrested at the primary follicle (FSH-independent) stage. In these animals we propose that the absence of BMP-15 results in the cessation of GC proliferation, which in turn leads to arrested follicle development. In summary, the conclusion emerging from these findings is that BMP-15 can inhibit some of the most important events in the process of FSH-dependent GC cytodifferentiation, including the expression of the FSH-R itself. Consequently the oocyte can play an important role in determining GC proliferation and FSH sensitivity in developing follicles. We appreciate constructive discussion with Drs. Kelly Moore and Woo-Sik Lee and the technical assistance of Mei Wang and typing of Andrea Hartgrove."

Based on the known strong propensity of the cyclam moiety to bind carboxylic acid groups, receptor mutagenesis identified Asp171 and Asp262, located in transmembrane domain (TM) IV and TM-VI, respectively, at each end of the main ligand-binding crevice of the CXCR4 receptor, as being essential for the ability of AMD3100 to block the binding of the chemokine ligand stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α as well as the binding of the receptor antibody 12G5. The free cyclam moiety had no effect on 12G5 binding, but blocked SDF-1α binding with an affinity of 3 μm through interaction with Asp171. The effect on SDF-1α binding of a series of bicyclam analogs with variable chemical linkers was found to rely either only on Asp171, i.e. the bicyclams acted as the isolated cyclam, or on both Asp171 and Asp262, i.e. they acted as AMD3100, depending on the length and the chemical nature of the linker between the two cyclam moieties. A positive correlation was found between the dependence of these compounds on Asp262 for binding and their potency as anti-human immunodeficiency virus agents. It is concluded that AMD3100 acts on the CXCR4 receptor through binding to Asp171 in TM-IV and Asp262 in TM-VI with each of its cyclam moieties, and it is suggested that part of its function is associated with a conformational constraint imposed upon the receptor by the connecting phenylenebismethylene linker.

Bicyclams derivatives composed of two cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) units linked by an aliphatic or aromatic linker (see Fig. 1) have been identified as potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 type 1 and type 2 replication (1De Clercq E. Yamamoto N. Pauwels R. Baba M. Schols D. Nakashima H. Balzarini J. Debyser Z. Murrer B.A. Schwartz D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5286-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The lead compound of the bicyclam series was discovered as an impurity being responsible for the antiviral effect in a preparation of cyclam (2Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Adv. Antiviral Drug Des. 1999; 3: 161-229Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The prototype bicyclam, AMD3100, in which the two macrocyclic rings are connected by a phenylenebis(methylene) linker (Fig. 1), has a potency against HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication of 1–10 nm (3De Clercq E. Yamamoto N. Pauwels R. Balzarini J. Witvrouw M. De Vreese K. Debyser Z. Rosenwirth B. Peichl P. Datema R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and is currently used as the first coreceptor antagonist in Phase II clinical trials against AIDS (4Hendrix C.W. Flexner C. MacFarland R.T. Giandomenico C. Fuchs E.J. Redpath E. Bridger E. Henson G.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1667-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of action of AMD3100 was initially believed to be related directly to the viral gp120 protein (5De Vreese K. Kofler-Mongold V. Leutgeb C. Weber V. Vermeire K. Schacht S. Anne J. De Clercq E. Datema R. Werner G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 689-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The problem was that the bicyclams were discovered in 1989, i.e. long before details of the molecular machinery on the target cell responsible for HIV cell entry had been characterized. Shortly after the discovery of the HIV coreceptors, it was shown that the bicyclams in fact inhibit HIV replication by binding to the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, which is the main coreceptor for gp120 used by X4, T-tropic strains of HIV for membrane fusion and cell entry (6Schols D.

Thus, AMD3100 was the first non-peptide CXCR4 receptor antagonist discovered and optimized long before the receptor was shown to bind the SDF-1α chemokine. The structure-function relationship with respect to the antiviral effect of the bicyclams has been worked out in great detail by De Clercq et al. (1De Clercq E. Yamamoto N. Pauwels R. Baba M.

The optimum structural features required for potent antiviral activity of “bicyclam” analogs include the presence of two azamacrocyclic rings containing 12–14 atoms/ring and ameta- or para-substituted phenylenebismethylene linker (para more active than meta) connecting the macrocyclic rings at nitrogen positions. The introduction of electron-withdrawing or -donating groups to the aromatic ring did not adversely affect antiviral activity; however, sterically hindering groups that restrict rotation of the macrocyclic rings at the benzylic position had a detrimental effect on antiviral potency. The relatively simple, symmetric structure of AMD3100 combined with the detailed knowledge of its structure-function relationship offer particular opportunities for understanding the molecular interaction of this non-peptide antagonist with its receptor target. It could, for example, be envisioned that the cyclam moieties by themselves could make strong enough interactions with the receptor for their binding sites to be identified by mutagenesis. The isolated 1,4,8,11-tetrazacyclotetradecane ring has an overall charge of +2 at physiological pH (12Izatt R.M. Pawlak K. Bradshaw J.S. Bruening R.L. Chem. Rev. 1991; 91: 1721-2085Crossref Scopus (2118) Google Scholar), and x-ray and neutron diffraction structures have shown that the protonated cyclam ring has the propensity to form a direct, hydrogen-bonded stabilized complex with carboxylic acid groups (13Adam K.R. Antolovich M. Atkinson I.M. Leong A.J. Lindoy L.F. McCool B.J. Davis R.L. Kennard C.H. Tasker P. J. Chem. Soc. ( Lond. ). 1994; 13: 1539-1540Google Scholar). In accordance with this, initial mutagenesis studies have shown that acidic residues in the second extracellular loop and in transmembrane domain (TM) IV of the CXCR4 receptor apparently are involved in the antiviral effect of AMD3100 (14Labrosse B. Brelot A. Heveker N. Sol N. Schols D. De Clercq E. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6381-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclam rings are also known to be able to chelate metal ions (15Troutner D.E. Simon J. Ketring A.R. Volkert W. Holmes R.A. J. Nucl. Med. 1980; 21: 443-448PubMed Google Scholar); and recently, it has been shown that transition metal ions chelated by the two macrocyclic rings of AMD3100 increase the CXCR4-binding affinity and potency of AMD3100 by 10-fold (16Este J.A. Cabrera C. De Clercq E. Struyf S. Van Damme J. Bridger G. Skerlj R.T. Abrams M.J. Henson G. Gutierrez A. Clotet B. Schols D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This could indicate that, for example, metal ion-binding His residues, of which there are several in the main ligand-binding crevice of the CXCR4 receptor, could be involved in the binding of the bicyclam compounds (Fig.2). In this study, we have, based on the knowledge of the possible binding mode of the cyclam as such, initially targeted aspartate and histidine residues in the CXCR4 receptor for mutagenesis and combined this with studies of a series of bicyclam analogs with variable chemical linkers. The two major hits for AMD3100 binding (one of which was shown to be involved in cyclam binding) were located at each end of the main ligand-binding pocket, which we previously have analyzed in great detail in several other 7TM receptors, for example, by metal ion site engineering (17Elling C.E.

Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T., I Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5039) Google Scholar), AMD3100 could be manually docked directly in between the two proposed cyclam-binding sites. Point mutations were introduced in the receptor by the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using the human wild-type CXCR4 receptor cDNA as template. All reactions were carried out using the Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The generated fragments were subcloned into the pTEJ-8 eukaryotic expression vector (22Johansen T.E. Schøller M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) containing the wild-type CXCR4 receptor cDNA by substituting the wild-type cDNA fragment with the mutant cDNA fragment. The mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing (ABI 310, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-7 cells were grown at 10% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. The wild-type and mutant CXCR4 receptors were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (23Gether U. Johansen T.E. Schwartz T.W.

This SDF-1α contains an additional NH2-terminal methionine; however, the protein shows the same binding properties as natural ligand SDF-1α (24Signoret N. Oldridge J. Pelchen M.A. Klasse P.J. Tran T.

AMD3100, AMD3106, AMD3108, AMD2763, AMD2849, AMD3389, and AMD2936 were synthesized as described (9Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Thornton D. Padmanabhan S. Martellucci S.A. Henson G.W. Abrams M.J.

Cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) was purchased from Aldrich. The transfected COS-7 cells were transferred to culture plates 1 day after transfection. The number of cells seeded per well was determined by the apparent expression efficiency of the individual clones; the number of cells/well was adjusted aiming at 5–10% binding of the added radioligand. Two days after transfection, cells were assayed by competition binding performed on whole cells for 3 h at 4 °C using 12 pm 125I-Met-SDF-1α or 32 pm 125I-12G5 plus variable amounts of unlabeled peptide or non-peptide compounds in 400 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.7) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After incubation, cells were washed quickly four times in 4 °C binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Determinations were made in duplicate. IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression using Prism 3.0 (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). In COS-7 cells transiently expressing the human CXCR4 chemokine receptor, cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) competed for125I-Met-SDF-1α binding with an affinity (Ki) of 13 μm, whereas it was unable to displace the radiolabeled monoclonal receptor antibody (125I-12G5) from CXCR4 even at millimolar concentrations (Fig. 3). In contrast, the bicyclam compound AMD3100, in which two identical cyclam rings have been joined by a phenylenebis(methylene) linker, showed a 200-fold higher affinity compared with the cyclam moiety (Ki = 74 nm) in competition against 125I-Met-SDF-1α, and the bicyclam could compete against 125I-12G5 binding to CXCR4 with an affinity that was <10-fold lower than against the chemokine ligand (Fig. 3). Asp and His residues in the CXCR4 receptor were targeted for mutagenesis based on the assumption that each cyclam ring of AMD3100 and analogs would be doubly protonated at physiological pH or conceivably would be able to complex transition metal ions such as zinc in vitro to give a metal complex with an overall charge of +2. In either structural scenario, the Asp and His residues of the CXCR4 receptor could be considered partners for complexation. Thus, all His residues located in the extracellular loops or in the transmembrane domains (i.e. His113, His203, His281, and His294) were individually mutated to Ala residues (Fig. 2). In addition, four Asp residues (Asp171 (located in TM-IV), Asp182 and Asp193 (located in extracellular loop 2), and Asp262 (located in TM-VI)) were mutated to Asn residues (Fig. 2). As shown in Table I, all of these single mutations were expressed well in the COS-7 cells, and all bound the chemokine ligand Met-SDF-1α with similar affinity as the wild-type CXCR4 receptor. The affinity of the cyclam as determined in competition for 125I-Met-SDF-1α binding was also unaffected by all these mutations, except for the Asn substitution of Asp171 located in the extracellular part of TM-IV, which impaired the cyclam binding by 30-fold (Fig.4 B and Table I). The binding of the bicyclam AMD3100 was also affected by this mutation and to a similar extent (Fig. 4 A). However, in contrast to the free cyclam, the binding of the bicyclam AMD3100 was also impaired by the Asn substitution of Asp262, located at the extracellular end of TM-VI (Fig. 4 A), but not by any of the other Asp or His substitutions (Table I). In the D171N and the D262N mutants, the competition curve of AMD3100 against 125I-Met-SDF-1α binding was shifted almost to the position of the cyclam in the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, just as cyclam was unable to compete for 125I-12G5 binding in the wild-type CXCR4 receptor (Fig. 3), AMD3100 was also unable to compete for 125I-12G5 binding in the D171N and D262N mutants (Fig. 5and Table II). The double mutant D171N/D262N unfortunately had an expression level that was too low to verify an expected complete loss of binding of AMD3100.Table IAffinity of Met-SDF-1α, AMD3100, and cyclam for the wild-type CXCR4 receptor and His- and Asp-substituted CXCR4 receptor mutantsBmax ± S.E.Met-SDF-1αAMD3100Cyclamlog Kd ± S.E.Kd(n)log Ki ± S.E.Ki(n)log Ki ± S.E.Ki (n)fmol/100,000 cellsnmnmμmHuman wild-typeCXCR434 ± 5.2−9.30 ± 0.090.49 (15)−7.13 ± 0.1074 (11)−4.90 ± 0.1113 (6)H113A9.2 ± 2.5−9.55 ± 0.150.28 (8)−6.89 ± 0.01130 (3)−5.07 ± 0.258.5 (6)D171N10.0 ± 3.4−9.24 ± 0.300.58 (7)−5.56 ± 0.312800 (3)−3.43 ± 0.11370 (3)D182N20 ± 7.8−9.36 ± 0.120.43 (5)−6.89 ± 0.10130 (3)−4.93 ± 0.0912 (3)D193N24 ± 10.0−9.36 ± 0.260.44 (3)−7.09 ± 0.1381 (3)−5.04 ± 0.119.2 (3)H203A7.8 ± 2.6−9.27 ± 0.230.53 (5)−7.17 ± 0.1668 (3)−4.79 ± 0.1616 (3)D262N20 ± 7.0−8.92 ± 0.211.2 (7)−5.95 ± 0.101100 (5)−5.02 ± 0.229.6 (4)H281A7.2 ± 1.5−9.55 ± 0.060.28 (7)−7.62 ± 0.1724 (5)−4.49 ± 0.1533 (4)H294A73 ± 14−9.06 ± 0.200.88 (3)−6.86 ± 0.05140 (3)−4.59 ± 0.1326 (3)H113A/H281A9.2 ± 5.4−9.54 ± 0.130.29 (4)−7.22 ± 0.0761 (3)−5.11 ± 0.087.8 (3)D171N/D262NLow expression(4)NDNDThe data were obtained from competition binding on COS-7 cells expressing the wild-type and mutant receptors using125I-Met-SDF-1α as radioligand.

The data were obtained from competition binding on COS-7 cells expressing the wild-type and mutant receptors using 125I-12G5 as radioligand. Values in parentheses represent number of experiments (n). Based on these mutagenesis results and on the assumption that the cyclam moiety could directly interact with the carboxylic acid group of Asp residues (2Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Adv. Antiviral Drug Des. 1999; 3: 161-229Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it was presumed that AMD3100 would bind in between the transmembrane segments, with one cyclam moiety toward Asp171 in TM-IV and the other interacting with Asp262 in TM-VI. This binding mode for AMD3100 was also compatible with molecular models of the CXCR4 receptor (see “Discussion”). To probe this binding mode further, a series of analogs of AMD3100 with different linkers between the two cyclam moieties were tested in the Asp171 and Asp262mutants. In AMD2763 and AMD2849, the aromatic phenylenebis(methylene) linker of AMD3100 was substituted with an aliphatic linker consisting of either three or six methylene groups. Of these, AMD2849 with the long aliphatic linker behaved almost like two “free” cyclam molecules, whereas AMD2763 with the short linker behaved more like the bicyclam AMD3100. Thus, the affinity of AMD2763 was only 3-fold lower than that of AMD3100 as monitored in competition with 125I-Met-SDF-1α binding (Table II), and like AMD3100, the high affinity binding of AMD2763 was dependent on both Asp171 and Asp262 (Fig.6 A), although the substitution at position 171 affected its binding more than the substitution at position 262. In AMD2849, the extension of the linker between the two cyclam moieties with three more methylene groups compared with AMD2763 decreased the affinity almost to that observed with cyclam,i.e. Ki = 2.3 versus 13 μm (these figures are even closer when it is taken in account that AMD2849 in fact holds two cyclam moieties). Importantly, AMD2849 binding was (again like cyclam) dependent only on Asp171 and was not affected by the substitution of Asp262 (Fig. 6 B). In AMD3106 and AMD3108, the meta-disubstituted phenyl group of the linker of AMD3100 was exchanged with either a 2,6-disubstituted pyridine (AMD3106) or with a 2,4-disubstituted pyridine (AMD3108) (Fig.1). Of these, the pyridine nitrogen of the 2,4-disubstituted analog (AMD3108) has a strong tendency to form pendant interactions with the adjacent macrocyclic (cyclam) ring, which apparently constrains the conformation of the compound in a way that impairs its function (2Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Adv. Antiviral Drug Des. 1999; 3: 161-229Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar,11Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Padmanabhan S. Martellucci S.A. Henson G.W. Abrams M.J. Joao H.C. Witvrouw M. De Vreese K. Pauwels R. De Clercq E. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For sterical reasons, this pendant interaction is not possible in the 2,6-disubstituted analog (AMD3106), which therefore should be able to function in a manner very similar to AMD3100 (2Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Adv. Antiviral Drug Des. 1999; 3: 161-229Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, AMD3106 in the transfected COS-7 cells bound with an affinity almost identical to that of AMD3100, and its binding was affected by the Asp171 and Asp262 substitutions in a manner almost identical to that which was observed for AMD3100 (Fig.7 A). In contrast, the affinity of the AMD3106 isomer (AMD3108) was decreased 10-fold compared with AMD3100 and AMD3106, and importantly, the binding of AMD3108 was dependent only on Asp171 and not on Asp262(Fig. 7 B). Thus, although AMD3108 binds with a higher affinity than cyclam (albeit still reduces compared with AMD3100), the binding mode of the 2,4-disubstitutted pyridine derivative appears to be similar to that of a cyclam, i.e. being independent of Asp262. Deletion of one of the macrocyclic rings of AMD3100 resulted in a monocyclam analog (AMD3389), which bound with surprisingly high affinity. AMD3389, which is a cyclam with the attached para-xylylene group (the “linker” in AMD3100), displaced 125I-Met-SDF-1α from the wild-type CXCR4 receptor with an affinity ∼100-fold higher than that of the free tetraazacyclotetradecane moiety, i.e. with an affinity almost as high as that of the intact AMD3100 molecule (Ki = 170 versus 74 nm) (Fig.8 A and TableIII). Importantly, the binding mode of AMD3389 was similar to that of the cyclam, as it was highly dependent on Asp171 and not impaired by substitution of Asp262 (Fig. 8 B). As the binding of AMD3389 was not affected by any of the other mutants tested in this study (data not shown), the structural basis for its high affinity binding compared with free cyclam could not be further determined here. However, the data do indicate that the para-phenylenebis(methylene) linker could contribute substantially to the binding of not only AMD3389, but possibly also AMD3100. In contrast to the bicyclam AMD3100, which potently inhibited the binding of the receptor antibody 12G5, and in contrast to the free monocyclam, which did not affect 12G5 binding, AMD3389 surprisingly potentiated the binding of the125I-12G5 receptor antibody in wild-type CXCR4 with an EC50 similar to its IC50 for inhibition of125I-Met-SDF-1α binding (Fig. 8 B). This ability of AMD3389 to potentiate 12G5 binding was impaired in the D171N mutant and almost eliminated in the D262N mutant.Table IIIBinding of various ligands to the wild-type, D171N, and D262N CXCR4 receptors expressed in COS-7 cells using 125I-Met SDF-1α as radioligandWild-typeD171ND262Nlog Ki ± S.E.Ki(n)log Ki ± S.E.Ki(n)log Ki ± S.E.Ki (n)μmμmμmAMD3100−7.13 ± 0.100.074 (11)−5.56 ± 0.312.8 (3)−5.95 ± 0.101.1 (5)AMD3106−7.08 ± 0.070.083 (4)−4.76 ± 0.1017 (3)−5.76 ± 0.371.8 (3)AMD3108−6.07 ± 0.100.85 (4)−4.17 ± 0.2268 (3)−5.66 ± 0.122.2 (3)AMD2936−6.19 ± 0.070.65 (3)−4.24 ± 0.3658 (3)−5.47 ± 0.063.4 (3)AMD2763−6.74 ± 0.100.18 (3)−4.35 ± 0.1945 (3)−5.81 ± 0.181.6 (3)AMD2849−5.63 ± 0.052.3 (3)−4.65 ± 0.1223 (3)−5.71 ± 0.142.0 (3)AMD3389−6.78 ± 0.100.17 (3)−4.08 ± 0.1784 (3)−7.21 ± 0.190.062 (3)Monocyclam−4.90 ± 0.1113 (6)−3.43 ± 0.11370 (3)−5.02 ± 0.229.6 (4)Values in parentheses represent number of experiments (n).

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 833-839PubMed Google Scholar), and a good correlation was found between their antiviral potency and the affinity measured in competition with the 12G5 receptor antibody (Fig. 9 A). Interestingly, however, the monocyclam analog AMD3389 clearly fell outside this correlation, as its high affinity in potentiating 12G5 binding (Fig. 8 B) did not correlate with its relatively poor ability to inhibit HIV-1 cell entry (Fig. 9 A). A reasonable correlation was found also between the antiviral potency of the cyclam and bicyclam analogs and their affinity as antagonists of SDF-1α binding, r = 0.86 (Fig. 9 B). However, in absolute numbers, the correlation was not really good because the span of antiviral potencies covered 5 orders of magnitude, i.e.from 10− 9 to 10− 4 m, whereas the affinities for these compounds as competitors of SDF-1α binding only covered 2 orders of magnitude, from 10− 7 to 10− 5 m (Fig. 9 B). An interesting highly significant correlation was found between the potency of the compounds in HIV cell entry assays and their dependence on Asp262 for binding, again with ADM3389 being a clear exception (Fig. 9 C). However, it should be noted that concerning Asp262, the affinity of AMD3389 was in fact increased by substitution of this residue, whereas its ability to potentiate 12G5 binding was eliminated, indicating a complex interaction mode. Nevertheless, for the rest of the compounds, the very clear correlation shown in Fig.9 C indicates that interaction with Asp262 could be particularly important for the ability of these compounds to function as anti-HIV agents. In this study, the binding of the non-peptide CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 has been characterized by combining receptor mutagenesis with studies of chemical analogs of the compound. In respect to understanding ligand-receptor interactions, AMD3100 is particularly interesting since it is a relatively simple, symmetric compound consisting of two identical azamacrocyclic structures combined through a linker (Fig. 1). Thus, based on studies of the free cyclam moiety and of bicyclam analogs with modified linkers, we propose a molecular mode of action for AMD3100 in which the two cyclam moieties bind to two Asp residues, Asp171 and Asp262, located at the extracellular ends of TM-IV and TM-VI, respectively. This notion is supported by the fact that in a molecular model of the CXCR4 receptor built over the newly published x-ray structure of rhodopsin (20Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T., I Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5039) Google Scholar) by simple replacement of side chains, AMD3100 could be directly docked into an optimum interaction with these two Asp residues (Fig. 10). The isolated 1,4,8,11-tetrazacyclotetradecane ring (cyclam) has an overall charge of +2 at physiological pH (12Izatt R.M. Pawlak K. Bradshaw J.S. Bruening R.L. Chem. Rev. 1991; 91: 1721-2085Crossref Scopus (2118) Google Scholar), and x-ray and neutron diffraction structures have shown that the protonated cyclam ring has the propensity to form a direct, hydrogen-bonded stabilized complex with carboxylic acid groups (13Adam K.R. Antolovich M. Atkinson I.M. Leong A.J. Lindoy L.F. McCool B.J. Davis R.L. Kennard C.H. Tasker P. J. Chem. Soc. ( Lond. ). 1994; 13: 1539-1540Google Scholar). Among the acidic residues located in the main ligand-binding crevice of the CXCR4 receptor, Asp171was identified as being important for the ability of the isolated cyclam moiety to compete for SDF-1α binding. Substitution of the other Asp residue in this main pocket, Asp262 in TM-VI, did not affect binding of the free cyclam. Importantly, however, the binding of the bicyclam AMD3100 was dependent not only on Asp171, but also on Asp262. It is possible that the free cyclam moiety also binds to Asp262, but that its affinity for Asp262 is relatively low compared with the binding to Asp171. If so, the binding to Asp262will not be appreciated in the competition binding experiments. When the supposedly main binding site for the free cyclam moiety is eliminated in the D171N mutation, the affinity of the monocyclam was determined to be ∼400 μm. This could possibly represent the affinity of the cyclam at the Asp262 site, which could have been confirmed by the D171N/D262N double mutation. However, the low expression level of this construct unfortunately prohibited this. Another possibility is that although cyclam binds to Asp262, this binding could be silent with respect to the effect on SDF-1α binding. Nevertheless, the fact that the bicyclam AMD3100 clearly is dependent on both Asp171 and Asp262 and the fact that cyclam has a strong propensity to interact with carboxylic acid groups indicate that each of the cyclam moieties of the bicyclam binds to each of these two Asp residues located in TM-IV and TM-VI, respectively. The suggested binding mode for AMD3100 versus cyclam is supported by the results obtained with analogs having different linkers. When the aromatic, conformationally constraining phenylenebismethylene linker of AMD3100 was exchanged with an aliphatic propylene linker (AMD2763), the affinity of the compound was decreased, and it became more dependent on Asp171 and less dependent on Asp262 for competition against SDF-1α, i.e.more “cyclam-like.” When the aliphatic linker was extended by three more methylene groups (AMD2849), the bicyclam behaved in the binding assay almost exactly like two molecules of free cyclam (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the disubstituted pyridine-linked analog, which has a strong propensity to fold upon itself through pendant interaction of the pyridine with the neighboring azamacrocyclic ring, was dependent only on Asp171, i.e. it behaved like the free cyclam, whereas the isomeric pyridine-linked analog lacking this ability for pendant interaction bound just like AMD3100 (Fig.7). Recently, the first x-ray structure of a 7TM receptor, bovine rhodopsin, was published by Palczewski et al. (20Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T., I Teller D.C.

Based on this, residues in the rhodopsin structure located in the main ligand-binding pocket were substituted with the residues occurring in the CXCR4 receptor. Moreover, we took the liberty of removing the loop that connects TM-IV and TM-V and that also connects to the top of TM-III through a disulfide bridge. This loop, which occupies basically all of the space in the main ligand-binding pocket extracellular to the retinal ligand in rhodopsin, varies tremendously between receptors and is expected in “ordinary” 7TM receptors to be relatively moveable and to give way for ligands. In Fig. 10, Asp171 and Asp262, located at each “end” of the ligand-binding pocket of the CXCR4 receptor, have been highlighted. AMD3100 in an extended conformation corresponding to that previously suggested to be essential for its antiviral activity (10Joao H.C. De Vreese K. Pauwels R. De Clercq E. Henson G.W. Bridger G.J. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3865-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) could be manually docked into the main ligand-binding crevice of the CXCR4 receptor in a manner that positioned each of the cyclam moieties in close proximity to Asp171 in TM-IV and Asp262 in TM-VI, respectively (Fig. 10 A). If AMD3100 binds like this, how does it then act as an antagonist? The x-ray structure is based on the dark-state, inactive conformation of rhodopsin. Thus, conceivably AMD3100 can interact directly with the corresponding inactive state of the CXCR4 receptor, as indicated in Fig. 10 A. Because of the conformationally constraining spacer, AMD3100 could simply prevent the receptor from changing into a yet unknown active conformation. The free cyclam moiety conceivably can interact with both Asp171 and Asp262 (Fig. 10 B); however, the presumed interaction with Asp262 is not detected in the binding assay. The three different ligands for CXCR4, i.e.the endogenous chemokine SDF-1α, the monoclonal receptor antibody 12G5, and HIV virons or rather the gp120 envelope protein, are not affected by AMD3100 in an identical manner. Importantly, receptor mutations affect AMD3100 function differently for the different ligands. In this study, the non-peptide compounds have mainly been probed as non-peptide antagonists normally are, i.e. for their effect on binding of the endogenous receptor ligand, in this case, the chemokine SDF-1α. However, AMD3100 was originally developed as a blocker of HIV replication, which turned out to be blockade of HIV binding to the CXCR4 receptor. Blocking SDF-1α binding, antibody binding, and binding of the HIV gp120 envelope protein is not necessarily the same function. For example, in this study, we found that mutations of Asp182 and Asp193 in extracellular loop 2 (Fig. 2) have no effect on the ability of AMD3100 to antagonize SDF-1α binding, whereas these residues in an initial mutational analysis of the CXCR4 receptor have been reported to be partially important for the ability of AMD3100 to block HIV replication (14Labrosse B. Brelot A. Heveker N. Sol N. Schols D. De Clercq E. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6381-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting observation along these lines is that AMD3389inhibition of SDF-1α binding is highly dependent on Asp171, but independent of Asp262, whereas itspotentiation of 12G5 antibody binding is totally dependent on Asp262 (Fig. 8). One explanation could be that the monocyclam analog can in fact bind in two fashions (perhaps even at the same time). In one binding mode, the compound binds mainly to Asp171 and blocks SDF-1α binding. In the other binding mode, AMD3389 interacts mainly with Asp262 and thereby presumably presents the overlying extracellular loop 2, which holds important epitopes for 12G5 (28Brelot A. Heveker N. Pleskoff O. Sol N. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a favorable way for antibody recognition. Interaction with Asp262 in TM-VI appears to be an important feature for this series of compounds with respect to their function as anti-HIV agents. All of the bicyclam compounds were highly dependent on interaction with Asp171, but varied in their dependence of Asp262. Importantly, a strong correlation could be demonstrated between the antiviral potency of the compounds and the apparent loss of their binding energy observed when Asp262was substituted with a non-charged Asn residue (Fig. 9 C). It could be interesting to probe whether the good pharmacological properties of AMD3100 and close analogs and the apparent requirement for forming a connection across the main ligand-binding crevice can be transferred to other classes of CXCR4 antagonists or other chemokine receptor antagonists in general. It should be emphasized that one of the hallmarks of AMD3100 is that it has a very broad specificity with respect to blocking basically all types of X4 envelopes, which obviously is a requirement for a good anti-HIV drug (29De Clercq E. Drugs R. D. 1999; 2: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This compound has been optimized for its antiviral activity through the cumbersome testing of every analog in HIV cell entry assays (2Bridger G.J. Skerlj R.T. Adv. Antiviral Drug Des. 1999; 3: 161-229Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the moment, this appears to be the safest approach. Although there is a correlation between the potency of the compounds as anti-HIV agents and their potency in inhibiting SDF-1α or 12G5 antibody binding, the correlation is not close enough, and there are outliers that deviate many orders of magnitude.

https://openalex.org/W2093526323,"Asporin, a novel member of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins, was partially purified from human articular cartilage and meniscus. Cloning of human and mouse asporin cDNAs revealed that the protein is closely related to decorin and biglycan. It contains a putative propeptide, 4 amino-terminal cysteines, 10 leucine-rich repeats, and 2 C-terminal cysteines. In contrast to decorin and biglycan, asporin is not a proteoglycan. Instead, asporin contains a unique stretch of aspartic acid residues in its amino-terminal region. A polymorphism was identified in that the number of consecutive aspartate residues varied from 11 to 15. The 8 exons of the human asporin gene span 26 kilobases on chromosome 9q31.1-32, and the putative promoter region lacks TATA consensus sequences. The asporin mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues with higher levels in osteoarthritic articular cartilage, aorta, uterus, heart, and liver. The deduced amino acid sequence of asporin was confirmed by mass spectrometry of the isolated protein resulting in 84% sequence coverage. The protein contains an N-glycosylation site at Asn(281) with a heterogeneous oligosaccharide structure and a potential O-glycosylation site at Ser(54). The name asporin reflects the aspartate-rich amino terminus and the overall similarity to decorin."

Based on earlier studies implicating ω-3 fatty acids as inhibitors of protein kinase C activity in intact cells, we hypothesized that ω-3 fatty acids may act through direct inhibition of second messenger-regulated kinases and sought to determine whether the ω-3 double bond might uniquely confer pharmacologic efficacy and potency for fatty acids of this type. In our studies we observed that ω-3 fatty acids inhibited the in vitro activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Our results with a series of long-chain fatty acid structural homologs suggest an important role for the ω-3 double bond in conferring inhibitory efficacy. To assess whether ω-3 fatty acids were capable of inhibiting protein kinases in living neurons, we evaluated their effect on signal transduction pathways in the hippocampus. We found that ω-3 fatty acids could prevent serotonin receptor-induced MAPK activation in hippocampal slice preparations. In addition, we evaluated the effect of ω-3 fatty acids on hippocampal long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity known to be dependent on protein kinase activation. We observed that ω-3 fatty acids blocked long-term potentiation induction without inhibiting basal synaptic transmission.

The designation omega-3 (ω-3) or omega-6 (ω-6), respectively, indicates if the third or sixth carbon from the methyl terminus is unsaturated. The ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are derived from the dietary intake of the 18-carbon precursors α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, respectively. The ω-3 fatty acids include: α-linolenic acid (18:3 ALA), stearidonic acid (18:4), eicosatetraenoic acid (20:4), eicosapentenoic acid (20:5 EPA), docosapentenoic acid (22:5), and docosaehexanoic acid (22:6 DHA). Dietary provision of long-chain ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids is essential because mammals are incapable of synthesizing fatty acids with a double bond past the Δ-9 position; thus, dietary intake of EFAs has far reaching consequences on membrane composition in all cells in the body and may influence neural function as well. The elucidation of the role for EFAs in neuronal function has followed two disparate lines of investigation. One approach has focused on the effects of dietary intake of EFAs on neuronal membrane composition and function. The reduction of dietary ω-3 fatty acids has been shown to have deleterious effects on cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) activities (1Speizer L.A. Watson M.J.

Masumura S. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition, increasing dietary intake of ω-3 fatty acids can improve learning and memory tasks in young rats and overcome deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP, Ref. 7McGahon B. Clements M.P. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a robust form of synaptic plasticity, in aged rats. These effects are theorized as being because of physical alterations in membrane characteristics, changing either the fluidity or rigidity of the membrane itself, and affecting neurotransmitter release as well as receptor and channel function (8Poling J.S. Karanian J.W. Salem Jr., N. Vicini S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 381-390PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nishikawa M. Kimura S. Akaike N. J. Physiol.

An alternative investigative approach has focused on the effectin vitro of direct application of ω-3 fatty acids on cellular biochemistry and synaptic transmission. Early reports showed that a variety of fatty acids are capable of activating PKC (11Hardy S.J. Ferrante A. Robinson B.S. Johnson D.W. Poulos A. Clark K.J. Murray A.W. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1546-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12McPhail L.C. Clayton C.C. Snyderman R. Science. 1984; 24: 622-625Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 13Murakami K. Chan S.Y. Routtenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15424-15429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, in other studies ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids caused inhibition when PKC was activated with phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (14Holian O. Nelson R. Anticancer Res. 1992; 12: 975-980PubMed Google Scholar). This latter effect may explain more recent reports that the application of ω-3 fatty acids to hippocampal slices can decrease membrane excitability and block low frequency stimulation-induced long-term depression (LTD, Refs. 15Xiao Y. Li X. Brain Res. 1999; 846: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Young C. Gean P.W. Wu S.P. Lin C.H. Shen Y.Z. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Young G. Shende A. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 1998; 30: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overall these reports suggest a multifaceted role for ω-3 EFAs involving both direct and indirect actions on neural function and suggest the hypothesis that ω-3 fatty acids may affect protein kinase activity. Questions concerning the mechanisms of action of EFAs are not trivial, as EFAs have been shown to have profound behavioral effects in humansin vivo. For example, dietary EPA and DHA elicit beneficial effects in certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. New studies of patients with manic-depression have shown significant reduction in reoccurrence of symptoms when the standard lithium treatment is supplemented with ω-3 fatty acids (18Stoll A.L. Severus W.E. Freeman M.P. Rueter S. Zboyan H.A. Diamond E. Cress K.K. Marangell L.B. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1999; 56: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The exact cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying the mood-stabilizing effect of ω-3 fatty acids are mysterious, making this a necessary and attractive area for study. To better understand the biochemical affects of ω-3 fatty acids on the CNS, we focused our attention on their effects on the activities of prevalent protein kinases of the CNS, using kinase assays in vitro. We found that DHA and EPA reduced the activity of protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (ERK1 and ERK2), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at low concentrations (IC50 2–36 μm). These effects appear to be dependent on the ω-3 double bond within the fatty acid, as structurally similar compounds saturated at the ω-3 position had little or no effect on kinase activity. We also used the hippocampal slice preparation to assess whether ω-3 fatty acids were capable of affecting protein kinase activity in the living neuron. In one series of studies, we observed that DHA and EPA inhibited serotonin (5-HT) receptor-induced activation of MAPK. In another study, we capitalized on the fact that hippocampal LTP is known to require protein kinase activation. We observed that perfusion of DHA or EPA onto hippocampal slices interfered with the induction of LTP in area CA1, presumably through the reduced activity of multiple protein kinases and disruption of the signaling pathways in which they are involved. Thus, the ω-3 fatty acids are surprisingly potent and efficacious broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting that protein kinases may be a target of action for ω-3 fatty acids in vivo.

Shen. Free fatty acids were made as 20 mm stock solutions in ethanol (vehicle) and stored under nitrogen, in the dark at −20 °C until needed. Enzyme activity was measured by quantifying incorporation of [32P]PO4 into a synthetic peptide substrate, amino acids 28–43 of neurogranin, PKC selectide, CalBiochem. Various concentrations of fatty acids, ranging from 0.4 to 400 μm were incubated with the catalytic domain of protein kinase C from rat brain. The reaction mixtures contained 10 ng of the PKC catalytic domain; reaction buffer (200 mm Tris, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mmNa2PO4); 10 μm of peptide substrate; [γ-32P]ATP; 0.5 mm ATP and H2O in a final assay volume of 50 μl. The reaction samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by addition of 25 μl of stop solution (225 mmH3PO4, 1 mm ATP). Two aliquots from each sample were transferred onto Whatman P-81 paper. After a 2-min incubation at room temperature, the filter papers were washed three times for 10 min in 0.25 m H3PO4and one time for 2 min in 95% (v/v) ethanol with gentle agitation. Chromatography papers were air dried prior to quantitation by liquid scintillation counting. Assays for PKA activity were performed as described in Roberson and Sweatt (19Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the exception that PKC and CaMKII inhibitors were absent from the reaction buffer, and the chromatography papers were washed in 75 mmH3PO4 three times for 10 min before rinsing in methanol. Kemptide (100 μm) was used as the substrate for PKA. The assays were performed as described in Roberson and Sweatt (19Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Reaction conditions consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 100 μm autocamtide, 25 units of CaMKII, 2.4 μm calmodulin, and 2 mm CaCl2 (to activate the enzyme), 100 μm ATP and γ-32P-labeled ATP to a final specific activity of 100 μCi/μmol. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C before stop solution was added. Reaction mixtures (prepared on ice) contained 20 ng of (1:5 dilution of 0.1 μg/μl MAPK) activated MAPK, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 500 μm ATP; 0.5 μg/μl Phas-I, [γ-32P]ATP 1.0 μCi/μl, and various concentrations of DHA and EPA (0.1–100 μm) in a final assay volume of 40 μl. The reaction samples were incubated 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by placing the reaction samples on ice with 5 μl of 0.25 mH3PO4 (stop solution). Two aliquots of each sample were transferred onto P-51 chromatography paper. After 2 min of incubation at room temperature, the filter papers were washed four times for 3 min each in 100 ml of 75 mmH3PO4 and then briefly in 95% (v/v) ethanol with gentle agitation. Chromatography papers were air-dried before the γ-32P incorporation was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from 8–12 week-old male mice as described previously (19Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Slices were allowed to recover in artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF: 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.24 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mmd-glucose, 2 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) for 3 h at 32 °C. ω-3 fatty acids or control fatty acids (10 μm) were added to slices for 1 h prior to 5-HT addition. 5-HT was added to slices at a 10 μmconcentration for 10 min at which time the slices were collected and frozen on dry ice. Slices were then homogenized, and samples were prepared as described previously (19Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Each n represents the pooled protein homogenate from three whole hippocampal slices. The samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to immobilon-P membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk solution and 1 μm microcysteine for 1 h. All blots were incubated at room temperature and washed in TTBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). Immunoreactivity was assessed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bands corresponding to phospho-p42 MAPK on each Western blot were quantified by densitometry using a StudioScan desktop scanner and NIH Image software. Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from 8–12 week-old male mice as described previously (19Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Slices were perfused (1 ml/min) with ACSF in an interface chamber maintained at 25 °C. Field recordings of the Schaffer collateral synapse were monitored for a minimum of 10 min before fatty acid application to ensure a stable baseline. Responses are presented as an average of 6 individual traces. Baseline stimulus intensities were determined from the intensity that produced a field EPSP at 50% of the maximal response. LTP was induced with two trains of 100-Hz stimulation for 1 s, separated by 20 s with the same stimulus intensity used in baseline recordings. Slices were perfused with ACSF at 1 ml/min with either fatty acids diluted to 10 μm or ACSF with the addition of an equal volume of vehicle. Fatty acids were perfused onto the slice 20 min prior to HFS and remained for 20 min after HFS delivery for a total of 40 min (see Fig. 7; B–D, black bar). The GraphPad Prism and Microsoft Power Point software packages were used for curve-fitting and statistical analyses. The therapeutically beneficial ω-3 fatty acids (typically found in fish oils) are long-chain, unbranched molecules. In the present studies we used a series of structurally related long-chain fatty acids to investigate the structure/function relationships for this category of compounds, examining their efficacy as inhibitors of protein kinases (Fig. 1). For the DHA family of fatty acids we investigated three structurally similar compounds. Docosahexaenoic acid [22:6 (ω-3), DHA] is a twenty-two carbon ω-3 fatty acid with a total of six double bonds. Compounds used as DHA controls included Behenic acid [22:0, BA], the saturated form of DHA lacking all double bonds including the ω-3 double bond, andcis-7,10,13,16-docosatetraenoic acid [22:4 (ω-6), DTEA], which lacks the ω-3 double bond and the number four double bond (Fig.1). Eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5 (ω-3), EPA] is a twenty carbon ω-3 fatty acid with a total of five double bonds. Arachidic acid [20:0], the saturated form of EPA, and Arachidonic acid [20:4 (ω-6), AA], lacking the ω-3 double bond, were also investigated as EPA controls (Fig. 1). We first tested if the parent ω-3 compounds DHA and EPA caused an effect on PKA catalytic subunit activity. To determine the potency of DHA and EPA as PKA inhibitors, we used various concentrations of fatty acids (0.4–400 μm) in assays in vitro for PKA phosphorylation of Kemptide substrate. Both DHA and EPA significantly inhibited the activity of the PKA catalytic subunit with an IC50 of 34 μm for DHA and 2 μm for EPA (Fig.2, A–B). Compounds such as BA and DTEA (Fig. 1) lacking the ω-3 moiety were used as controls for DHA. BA, the saturated form of DHA, did not significantly inhibit PKA activity (Fig. 2 A). DTEA, which not only lacks the ω-3 double bond but also lacks the double bond in the fourth position, had a substantially higher IC50 than DHA, with an IC50 of 230 μm. These results demonstrate that DHA is more potent in PKA inhibition than BA and DTEA and suggest that the ω-3 double bond is important in conferring potency and efficacy for inhibition of PKA. As controls for EPA we evaluated arachidic acid and AA. Arachidic acid, the saturated form of EPA lacking the ω-3 double bond, was not as potent in the inhibition of PKA phosphotransferase activity as EPA. This was evident in the calculated IC50 of >400 μm for arachidic acid. In addition, a calculated IC50 of 59 μmfor AA, which is structurally equivalent to EPA except for the lack of the ω-3 double bond, was 30-fold greater than the IC50for EPA of 2 μm (Fig. 2 B). Overall these data indicate that both DHA and EPA effectively inhibit PKA activityin vitro and suggest that the ω-3 double bond plays an important role in conferring inhibitory efficacy and potency for both types of compounds. Given the results described above, we wanted to test if the presence of the ω-3 double bond was sufficient to confer inhibitory efficacy. We therefore tested two other long-chain fatty acids that have the ω-3 double bond moiety incorporated into their structure. Toward this end we evaluatedcis-11,14,17-eicosatrienoic acid (ESEA), a twenty-carbon ω-3 fatty acid with three double bonds, andcis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (DPEA), a twenty-two carbon ω-3 fatty acid with a total of five double bonds (Fig. 1). We examined whether ESEA or DPEA exhibited inhibitory effects by evaluating the effect of increasing concentrations (1.0–400 μm for ESEA and 0.1–400 μm for DPEA) on PKA phosphotransferase activity (Fig. 2 C). We found that both ESEA and DPEA blocked PKA catalytic subunit activity; IC50 values were calculated to be 22 μm for ESEA and 10 μm for DPEA. Once again these data suggest that the ω-3 double bond plays an important role in the inhibition of PKA by these long-chain fatty acids. This is illustrated quite nicely, for example by comparing the potencies of DTEA versus DPEA (Fig. 2, A versus C). These two compounds are structurally identical with the exception of the ω-3 double bond contained within DPEA, which showed much greater potency than DTEA in PKA inhibition. Most broad-spectrum inhibitors of second messenger-regulated kinases are competitive with ATP (20Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y.

Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 577-581PubMed Google Scholar), and we sought to determine whether this was the mechanism of action of ω-3 fatty acids. If ω-3 fatty acids are competitive with ATP, then higher ATP concentrations should cause a shift to a higher IC50 for ω-3 fatty acid inhibition of PKA. We therefore compared the IC50 for EPA inhibition of PKA, using two different final ATP concentrations: 100 and 500 μm. EPA reduced PKA activity indistinguishably under both concentrations with no significant difference in inhibition of PKA activity (IC50 for both ATP concentrations was ∼2 μm, Fig. 3). These data strongly suggest that EPA is not a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to PKA. If fatty acids unsaturated in the ω-3 position have the capability of inhibiting the catalytic subunit of PKA, then it is reasonable to hypothesize that this effect may transcend to other protein kinases with homologous catalytic domains. Therefore we examined the effect of different long-chain fatty acids on two other kinases; PKC and CaMKII. We tested EPA, DHA, and AA on PKC catalytic domain phosphotransferase activity using a peptide substrate (in vitro) using increasing fatty acid concentrations (Fig.4 A). We found that ω-3 fatty acids inhibited PKC and, similar to results for PKA, EPA was found to be a more potent inhibitor of PKC activity than DHA (IC50for EPA was 2 μm compared with 36 μm for DHA). AA, which lacks the ω-3 double bond, was used as a control and did not cause significant inhibition of PKC enzymatic activity (IC50 >400 μm). Similarly, the inhibitory effect of EPA and DHA was also shown in assays using the catalytic subunit of CaMKII (Fig. 4 B). Both EPA and DHA inhibited CaMKII activity at relatively low concentrations with a calculated IC50 for EPA of 15 μm and for DHA of 36 μm. Thus similar to what was observed with PKC and PKA, EPA and DHA inhibit CaMKII. The second messenger-regulated kinases PKA, PKC and CaMKII share sequence homology within their catalytic domains. The ERK MAPKs are regulated by phosphorylation and not second messengers, but nevertheless exhibit structural homology to the PKA, PKC, and CaMKII catalytic domains (22Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E.

Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We therefore determined if ω-3 fatty acids inhibited MAPK activity. To determine the potency of EPA and DHA at inhibiting MAPK activity, increasing concentrations of both fatty acids (0.1–100 μm) were used (Fig. 4 C). Both ω-3 fatty acids inhibited MAPK activity, and EPA was a slightly more potent inhibitor of MAPK activity than DHA (IC50 for EPA was 23 μm and for DHA, 34 μm). Overall these data show that DHA and EPA act as broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors, blocking not only the activity of PKA, PKC, and CaMKII, but also the activity of MAPK. Valproic acid (VPA, 2-propylpentanoic acid), is a short chain length, eight carbon, branched fatty acid (Fig. 1) and, like ω-3 fatty acids, VPA has recently been used for treatment of bipolar disorder (24Hilty D.M. Rodriguez G.D. Hales R.E. J. Neuropsych. Clin. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 283-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Johannessen C.U. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). 2-ene-VPA (2-ene-valproate, 2-propyl-2-pentenoic acid, Fig. 1) is the major VPA metabolite in humans, which also contains the ω-3 moiety. Given that VPA and the ω-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA exhibit similar neurologic effects, we thought it an intriguing possibility that 2-ene-VPA might inhibit protein kinases in a fashion similar to the long-chain fatty acids described above. Therefore we tested whether VPA or 2-ene-VPA had the same inhibitory effect as long-chain ω-3 fatty acids on PKA and PKC activity in vitro. As expected, we found a lack of an inhibitory effect of VPA on PKC or PKA phosphotransferase activity at concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 μm (data not shown). Interestingly, there was also a lack of inhibition of PKA and PKC activity with 2-ene-VPA using concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 μm (Fig.5). Thus, the ω-3 moiety within the 2-ene-VPA does not confer significant inhibitory efficacy for PKC or PKA activity in vitro. This lack of effect of 2-ene-VPA may be because of its overall short chain length or the proximity of the carboxylic acid in relation to the ω-3 double bond. These data also indicate that neither VPA nor its major metabolite act by directly inhibiting PKA or PKC, suggesting that a different mechanism of action exists in vivo for VPA versus ω-3 long-chain fatty acids. Whereas the results thus far demonstrate that DHA and EPA have effects on kinase activity in vitro, they do not address whether the compounds are capable of inhibiting protein kinases in the intact cell. For the next stage of our studies we sought to develop a preparation that we could use to test the efficacy of ω-3 fatty acids in inhibiting protein kinases in living cells. The serotonergic signal transduction pathway can activate MAPK in a PKA-dependent process in aplysia sensory neurons, but the effects of 5-HT on MAPK in the mammalian brain have not been determined (26Martin K.C. Casadio A. Zhu H., E, Y. Rose J.C. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We reasoned that investigating serotonin-coupled kinase activation was a desirable avenue of pursuit because the serotonergic system is widely implicated in affective disorders for which ω-3 fatty acids have beneficial effects. In our first studies, we found that 10 μm 5-HT caused MAPK activation in hippocampal slices evaluated by the increased phosphorylation of p42 MAPK (Fig.6), an effect blocked by EPA and DHA. The control compounds behenic acid and arachidic acid showed no inhibition of 5-HT receptor-induced MAPK activation. Application of ω-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) or control fatty acids (behenic acid and arachidic acid) to hippocampal slices alone had no effect on basal MAPK activation (data not shown). As an additional control we used the MEK inhibitor U0126 on 5-HT receptor-induced Erk activation. The compound U0126 completely blocked 5-HT-induced activation of MAPK in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results suggest that ω-3 fatty acids are capable of blocking serotonin-induced kinase activation in living neurons in the hippocampus. The very kinases shown here to be inhibited by ω-3 fatty acids have been shown previously to be necessary for mammalian synaptic plasticity, specifically LTP in the hippocampus. To determine the effect of ω-3 fatty acids on this kind of kinase-dependent synaptic plasticity in intact living neurons, we tested the ability of EPA and DHA to block the induction of LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus. The application of HFS (two trains at 100 Hz for 1 s, separated by 20 s) is sufficient to induce a long lasting potentiation at Schaffer collateral synapses (Fig.7 A). Application of DHA (10 μm) did not affect baseline synaptic transmission; however, perfusion prior to HFS completely blocks the induction of LTP (Fig. 7 C). Like DHA, EPA has little effect on baseline synaptic transmission and also blocks induction of LTP (Fig.7 D). As a control, we perfused slices with the long-chain fatty acid AA prior to HFS. (Fig. 7 B). Slices treated with AA showed potentiation (>150% compared with baseline) that was not different from untreated slices. Our results are consistent with the observations of Itokazu et al. (27Itokazu N. Ikegaya Y. Nishikawa M. Matsuki N. Brain Res. 2000; 862: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), who show that intracerebroventricular injection of DHA inhibited the induction of LTP in hippocampal area CA1, in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2135222945,"Ectodomain shedding of cell surface membrane-anchoring proteins is an important process in a wide variety of physiological events(1, 2). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) converting enzyme (TACE) is the first discovered mammalian sheddase responsible for cleavage of several important surface proteins, including TNF-alpha, TNF p75 receptor, L-selectin, and transforming growth factor-a. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) has long been known as a potent agent to enhance ectodomain shedding. However, it is not fully understood how PMA activates TACE and induces ectodomain shedding. Here, we demonstrate that PMA induces both reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and TNF p75 receptor shedding in Mono Mac 6 cells, a human monocytic cell line, and l-selectin shedding in Jurkat T-cells. ROS scavengers significantly attenuated PMA-induced TNF p75 receptor shedding. Exogenous H2O2 mimicked PMA-induced enhancement of ectodomain shedding, and H2O2-induced shedding was blocked by TAPI, a TACE inhibitor. Furthermore, both PMA and H2O2 failed to cause ectodomain shedding in a cell line that lacks TACE activity. By use of an in vitro TACE cleavage assay, H2O2 activated TACE that had been rendered inactive by the addition of the TACE inhibitory pro-domain sequence. We presume that the mechanism of TACE activation by H2O2 is due to an oxidative attack of the pro-domain thiol group and disruption of its inhibitory coordination with the Zn++ in the catalytic domain of TACE. These results demonstrate that ROS production is involved in PMA-induced ectodomain shedding and implicate a role for ROS in other shedding processes."

Furthermore, injection of decorin into rats with experimental glomerulonephritis curtailed the abnormal deposition of matrix suggesting that decorin may affect transforming growth factor-β activity also in vivo (21Border W.A.

Recently, it has been shown that decorin can down-regulate epidermal growth factor receptor leading to growth suppression, and decorin may act as a natural inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway (23Csordas G.

Therefore, a role for SLRPs in collagen fiber formation is clearly established both in vivo and in vitro. Biglycan-null mice exhibit a mild osteoporosis-like phenotype (35Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W.

Recently, patients with cornea plana 2 (MIM 217300) were shown to have mutations in the keratocan gene, a class II SLRP family member (36Pellegata N.S. Dieguez-Lucena J.L. Joensuu T. Lau S.

Nucleotide sequencing of a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC, RPCI11–917O5), and contigs of overlapping BAC clones revealed that four SLRPs genes (decorin, lumican, keratocan, andepiphycan/PG-Lb) are physically linked on human chromosome 12q (36Pellegata N.S.

Previous genetic linkage studies in the mouse suggested thatdecorin, lumican, and epiphycan map together in a cluster in close proximity to the Mgf gene on mouse chromosome 10, and these genes are deleted in mice that have large deletion mutations at the Steel locus (37Danielson K.G.

A computer homology search of the genome data bases was, therefore, initiated to look for additional, unidentified SLRP family members that might be associated with these clusters or a yet unidentified cluster. In this study, we identify a novel SLRP family member that belongs to the class I subfamily and is closely related to biglycan and decorin. We have named this new SLRP asporin due to the uniqueaspartate stretch at the N terminus of the translated open reading frame. We report the molecular cloning of the full-length mouse and partial human cDNA and investigate asporin mRNA expression in mouse embryonic development. In addition, we have determined the mouse and human asporin gene structure and discovered that the human asporin gene is part of a SLRP gene cluster on human chromosome 9q21.3–9q22 that also containsosteoadherin, osteoglycin/mimecan, and a gene encoding another LRR-containing protein, ECM2 (42Nishiu J.

Radioisotopes [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Random labeling kits, T7 QuickPrime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and DNA Strip-EZ (Ambion, Austin, TX) kit were used. Hybridization fluids used were either Rapid-Hyb (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or UltraHyb (Ambion). Imaging film and emulsion were purchased from Kodak (X-Omat AR film and NTB-2 emulsion). The full-length mouse cDNA was obtained by aligning nucleotide sequences of overlapping PCR products. RNA was extracted from mouse ATDC5 cells and first-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the reagents provided in the SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The gene-specific primers for mouseasporin were designed from nucleotide sequences contained in expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that were publicly available in GenBankTM data bases. For 5′ RACE reactions, reverse oligonucleotide primers were designed against mouse EST GenBankTM accession number AI 006670 (MS ASP RV 406, 5′-AGGCTTCACTGGCTCTTTCGTAGGAAAAAG; and MS ASP RV 343, 5′-CGTCATCATCTGTGTCTTCCATATCCTTC). For 3′ RACE reactions, forward oligonucleotides were designed against mouse EST GenBankTMaccession number AA980962 (MS ASP FW 983, 5′-CTTGAAGATCTTAAACGGTACAGGGAACTGC; and MS ASP FW 1077, 5′-CCACGTGTGAGAGAGATACACTTGGAACAC). First round PCR conditions for 5′ and 3′ RACE were as follows: the template-RACE ready cDNA; gene specific oligonucleotides, MS ASP RV 406 (5′ RACE) and MS ASP FW 983 (3′ RACE), 25 cycles (5 s 94 °C, 10 s 60 °C, 2 min 72 °C). First round PCR products were diluted and used as template in a second round “nested” PCR as recommended by the instructions provided with the kit. Nested PCR products for 14 clones harboring 5′ RACE products were resolved electrophoretically on an ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel. Five of the plasmids containing 5′ RACE products of different sizes were sequenced in both directions using the T3 and T7 primers. The largest fragment was called p329, and was used in subsequent Northern, Southern, and in situhybridization experiments. Analysis of this sequence in GenBankTM failed to reveal any homology to known cDNA or genomic sequences. Also, two clones harboring 3′ RACE products of identical size were sequenced in both directions using the T3 and T7 primers. Since the complete open reading frame (ORF) for mouse asporin could not be determined by alignment of overlapping mouse ESTs, two primers (Ms Start FW, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAACCCTTCTTTAGCCCTTCCCAC; Ms Stop RV, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTATTTTCCAACATTCCCAAGCTG) were designed to amplify by PCR the mouse asporin ORF (template of mouse RACE-ready cDNA,Pfu polymerase, 20 cycles (20 s 94 °C, 30 s 60 °C, 2 min 72 °C). The amplified mouse asporin ORF was digested with BamHI restriction enzyme and ligated toBamHI-cleaved pBluescript KS+. The resulting subcloned ORF plasmid was sequenced with three primers: T3, T7, and MS FW 775 (5′-GGACACGTTCAAGGGAATGAATGC) to determine the open reading frame of mouse asporin. Human heart RNA (Ambion) was reverse transcribed to first strand cDNA by using the SMARTTMRACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). A partial human cDNA was obtained that contained the open reading frame and the 5′-untranslated region. The gene-specific primers for human asporin were designed from nucleotide sequences contained in human ESTs, AK000136, FLJ20129, and AI539334. PCR conditions were as follows: template-human RACE ready cDNA; gene-specific oligonucleotides, HU ASP RV STOP (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTACATTCCAAAGTTCCCAAGCTGAAC) and HU ASP RV 1503 (5′-ACTGCAATAGATGCTTGTTTCTCTCAACCC), 30 cycles (5 s 94 °C, 10 s 60 °C, 2 min 72 °C). PCR-amplified products from first round 5′ RACE reactions were sequenced. Three consecutive Northern hybridizations were performed on a single mouse multi-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot (Origene). DNA fragments of mouseasporin, biglycan, and decorin cDNAs were random-labeled in separate Northern hybridizations. The asporin probe (p329) is a 478-base pair (bp) PCR-amplified 5′ RACE product that encodes for the 5′ end of the mouse asporin cDNA that includes the 5′-untranslated region (region of cDNA that is encoded by exon I) and a portion of the open reading frame (a fragment of the cDNA that is encoded by exon 2). The biglycan probe (p368) is a 731-bp PCR-amplified fragment that encodes for a portion of the 3′-untranslated region of mouse biglycan (7Wegrowski Y. Pillarisetti J. Danielson K.G. Suzuki S. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1995; 30: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PCR parameters are as follows: primers are MS BGN3, 5′-CCTGAGACCCTGAACGAACTTCACCTGG, and MS BGN4, 5′ CGGTGGCAGTGTGCTCTATCCATCTTTCC; template is mouse RACE-ready cDNA as described previously, 30 cycles (20 s 94 °C, 20 s 60 °C, 1 min 72 °C). The decorin probe (p280) is a 399-bp XbaI/HindIII fragment from the 3′ end of the mouse decorin open reading frame (6Scholzen T. Solursh M. Suzuki S. Reiter R. Morgan J.L. Buchberg A.M. Siracusa L.D. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28270-28281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA probes were random-labeled by using the Strip-EZTM kit (Ambion). Following an overnight hybridization at 42 °C, the blot was washed under high stringency (1% SDS, 2 × SSC) at 65 °C. The same blot was subjected to 3 separate Northern hybridizations in this order: asporin hybridization, strip blot of probe, decorin hybridization, strip blot of probe, and biglycan hybridization. Radiolabeled probes were removed using Ambion's Strip-EZ technology between consecutive hybridizations. The wash conditions following each hybrization are as follows: asporin, 2 washes of 5 min, film exposure 16 h; decorin, 2 washes of 30 min, film exposure 2 h; biglycan, 3 washes of 10 min, film exposure 7 h. Radioactive Northern blots were exposed to Kodak film (X-Omat AR). A PCR-amplified 5′ RACE product (p329) described earlier was used as a radiolabeled probe in a Southern hybridization to screen a mouse genomic BAC library (Research Genetics). After an overnight hybridization at 65 °C, the blots were washed under high stringency (1% SDS, 2 × SSC) at 65 °C (3 × 15 min) and exposed to x-ray film. Two BAC clones corresponding to positive signals seen on the developed film were purchased from Research Genetics. After annotation of the genomic nucleotide sequence from BAC numberAL137848, the exon/intron boundaries of the human asporingene were determined by aligning homologous regions of this sequence with sequence from available human ESTs. Assuming that the mouse gene structure is similar to the human gene structure, the regions in the mouse cDNA that encoded for exons in the mouse gene were predicted. Forward and reverse primers were designed from regions in the mouse cDNA that were predicted to encode for consecutive exons (i.e. forward primer in exon 1, reverse primer in exon 2). With purified mouse BAC DNA as template, such primer pairs were used in long distance PCR reactions to amplify the introns of the mouseasporin gene. Amplified fragments were separated by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 0.8% agarose gel to judge intron size and were subcloned using the pGEMTMT-easy vector system. Subcloned fragments were sequenced with the T7 and SP6 primers to determine the sequence of the mouse exon/intron boundaries. The primer pairs used to amplify the introns of the mouseasporin gene are as follows: intron 1: Asp Ex1 Fw38, 5′-GCACATAGAGGCTGTTAGGAGGGCTGG; Asp Ex2 Rv343, 5′-CGTCATCATCTGTGTCTTCCATATCCTTC; Intron 2: Asp Ex2 Start, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAACCCTTCTTTAGCCCTTCCCAC; Asp Ex3 Rv, 5- 5′-CGAGTATCAAATGGAATGTTGTTTGGAACCG; Intron 3: Asp Ex3 Fw, 5′-GCGTTCCAAACAACATTCCATTTGATACTCG, Asp Ex4 Rv, 5′-GTTGGTTGTGGGATAAATATAGCCTTCTC; Intron 4: Asp Ex4 Fw, 5′-GAGAAGGCTATATTTATCCCACAACCAAC, Asp Ex5 Rv, 5′-CCCTGGTTCTATCCCGTTGTTCTCAAGAGG; Intron 5: Asp Ex5 Fw, 5′-CCTCTTGAGAACAACGGGATAGAACCAGGG, Asp Ex6 Rv, 5′-CTTTGCAGTTCCCTGTACCGTTTAAGATC; Intron 6: Asp Ex6 Fw, 5′-CTTGAAGATCTTAAACGGTACAGGGAACTGC, Asp Ex7 Rv, 5′-GAGTTCCAAGTGTATCTCTCTCACACGTGG; Intron 7: Asp Ex7 Fw, 5′ CCACGTGTGAGAGAGATACACTTGGAACAC, Asp Ex8 Stop, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTATTTTCCAACATTCCCAAGCTG. Cycling parameters are as follows: template, 25 ng of purified BAC DNA, primers at a final concentration of 1 μm, Takara LATaq TM polymerase, 25 cycles (10 s, 98 °C, 6 min 66 °C). During annotation of the nucleotide sequence from BAC number AL137848, the exon/intron boundaries of the human asporin gene were established by aligning homologous regions of the genomic sequence with available human ESTs (i.e. AK000136, FLJ20129, and AI539334), and determining the regions in the human cDNA that encoded for exons in the human gene. The ENSEMBL web site on the Sanger Center server confirmed the location of an open reading frame (ENST00000026531) in BAC number AL137848 that we have named asporin. In situ hybridizations were performed on sections from different stages of mouse embryos. Sections were hybridized with [35S]UTP-labeled antisense or sense RNA probes generated from the plasmid p329 that contains the extreme 5′ end of the mouse asporin cDNA (1–478 bp). Pregnant C57Bl mice were sacrificed on various days post-coitus (dpc), embryos were harvested, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline/diethyl pyrocarbonate, and fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2–25 h. The fixed tissues were dehydrated through a series of increasing ethanol concentrations and then cleared in xylene before being embedded in paraffin. Sections of 7-μm in thickness were mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Dimineralization was performed by placing the tissue into a solution of 0.1 m Na phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 0.26m EDTA for 2–3 days at room temperature with several changes in between. The tissue was rinsed in diethyl pyrocarbonate/H2O, then dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentrations, and embedded and sectioned as described for embryonic tissue. In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described previously (45Zhao Q. Eberspaecher H. Lefebvre V. De Crombrugghe B. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 16–17 h. Two high stringency washes were performed at 55 °C in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC for 20 min each. Autoradiography was carried out using NTB-2 Kodak emulsion. The slides were exposed for 16 h to 7 days at 4 °C. Photomicrographs were taken using both bright and dark-field optics. A novel member of the class I SLRP gene family has been identified and named asporin. The cDNA sequence of human decorin (4Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) was used as a query to search the human dbEST data base of GenBankTM using the BLAST-N algorithm. At the time, the nucleotide sequence of several human expressed sequence tags (ESTs AK000136, FLJ20129, and AI539334) exhibited strong homology to the nucleotide sequence of the class I SLRPs, but individual ESTs did not encode a full-length ORF. Furthermore, alignment of overlapping human ESTs did not establish a complete, “in-frame” ORF, so human genomic sequence from BACAL137848 was used to correct the sequencing errors present in the human ESTs and to fill any gaps that were missing from the alignment of overlapping ESTs. These results revealed an open reading frame of 380 amino acids and were later confirmed experimentally by sequencing PCR products generated from 5′ RACE reactions that used reverse transcribed human heart RNA (first-strand cDNA) as template. The transcription start site of human asporin, as well as the open reading frame and 5′-untranslated region, were determined by nucleotide sequencing of 5′ RACE products obtained with the SMART cDNA amplification kit. Several 5′ RACE products were resolved electrophoretically on an ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel (data not shown). No attempts were made to clone the 3′-untranslated region of human asporin. An open reading frame of mouse asporin could not be obtained from overlapping mouse ESTs thus leaving a central gap in the computer-derived sequence. Furthermore, the genomic sequence of mouseasporin was not available in the public data bases. Therefore, oligonucleotide primers were designed from nucleotide sequences present in available 5"

Additionally, besides the transport of these compounds coupled to ATP hydrolysis, other complex interactions are known to occur in Pgp with modulators of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype (8Dey S.

Considering the importance of Pgp in cancer chemotherapy and as a model system for ABC transporters in general, a clear understanding of the catalytic cycle of this transporter is of considerable importance.

Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) was that of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. The essential feature of this model is alternating hydrolysis of ATP at the two ATP-binding sites. It was postulated that nucleotide first binds to one of the two sites but could not be hydrolyzed. When another nucleotide binds to the second site it promotes hydrolysis at the first site, which in turn powers substrate transport. In the next cycle, hydrolysis occurs at the second ATP site. We have recently (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) demonstrated that there is substantially greater complexity in the catalytic cycle of Pgp. We simultaneously monitored changes in the substrate- and nucleotide-binding sites to show that although binding of nucleotide per se does not affect interactions with the substrate, ATP hydrolysis results in a dramatic conformational change where the affinity of the substrate [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin ([125I]IAAP) for Pgp trapped in the transition state conformation (Pgp·ADP·Vi) is reduced >30-fold. Even more remarkable is the finding that to transform Pgp from this intermediate state of low affinity for substrate to the next catalytic cycle, i.e. a conformation that binds substrate with high affinity, the hydrolysis of an additional molecule of nucleotide is obligatory. This requirement for two ATP hydrolysis events in the course of a single catalytic cycle was consistent with the measured stoichiometry for Pgp where two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed for each substrate molecule transported (11Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar,12Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J.

In this study we have analyzed, in real time, the repeating succession of vanadate (Vi)-induced trapping and release of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP through an entire catalytic cycle, and we monitored the substrate ([125I]IAAP) binding at the beginning and end of each trapping (hydrolysis) event. The results, besides validating our model, provided experimental strategies for independently studying the kinetics of the two hydrolysis events. We find that at the end of the first hydrolysis event there is a >30-fold decrease in the affinity of nucleotide for Pgp coincident with the decreased substrate binding shown earlier (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Release of occluded ADP or 8-azido-ADP is adequate for the next hydrolysis event to occur but is not sufficient for recovery of substrate binding, which occurs only at the end of the second hydrolysis, i.e. after ADP dissociates from the transporter. Whereas the two hydrolysis events have different functional outcomes vis à vis the substrate, they show comparable t 12 for both incorporation and release of nucleotide, and the K mvalues for [α-32P]8-azido-ATP during the Vi-induced trapping during both hydrolysis events are identical. Similarly, the incorporation of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP in both the N-terminal and the C-terminal ATP sites is identical during both ATP hydrolysis events. These data demonstrate that during individual hydrolysis events the ATP sites are recruited in a random manner, and the fact that only one site is utilized at any given time is a consequence of the conformational change that reduces the affinity of nucleotide for the second ATP site. Thus, the prevention of ATP binding to the second site while the first one is in a catalytic conformation appears to be the explanation for alternate catalysis in Pgp. Cyclosporin A was purchased from Calbiochem. and [125I]Iodoarylazidoprazosin ([125I]IAAP) (2, 200 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Briefly, crude Pgp-containing membranes were solubilized with octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (1.25%) in the presence of 20% glycerol and lipid mixture (0.1%). Solubilized proteins were subjected to metal affinity chromatography (Talon resin, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in the presence of 0.95% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.04% lipid; 80% purified Pgp was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. Pgp in 100 mm imidazole fraction was then concentrated (Centriprep-50, Amicon, Beverly, MA) to ∼0.5 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C.

The crude membranes (10–50 μg) were incubated with the drug or modulator for 3 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and [125I]IAAP (unless otherwise stated, 3–6 nm) was added and incubated for an additional 5 min under subdued light. The samples were then illuminated with a UV lamp assembly (PGC Scientifics, Gaithersburg, MD) fitted with two black light (self-filtering) UV-A long wave F15T8BLB tubes (365 nm) for 10 min at room temperature (21–23 °C). Following SDS-PAGE on a 8% Tris glycine gel at constant voltage, gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C for 12–24 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the Pgp band was quantified using the STORM 860 PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and the software ImageQuaNT.

Crude membranes (1 mg/ml) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer (40 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium azide, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmMgCl2) containing 50 μm[α-32P]8-azido-ATP (containing 4 μCi/nmol) and 250 μm Vi in the dark at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 12.5 mm ice-cold ATP and placing the sample immediately on ice. The trapped nucleotides were photo-cross-linked as described below. Crude membranes (1 mg/ml) were incubated in the ATPase assay buffer containing 10 μm [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (containing 2–5 μCi/nmol) in the dark at 4 °C for 5 min. The samples were then irradiated with an UV lamp assembly (365 nm) for 10 min on ice (4 °C). Ice-cold ATP (12.5 mm) was added to displace excess noncovalently bound [α-32P]8-azido-ATP. Excess nucleotides were removed by centrifugation at 300,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min by using S120-AT2 rotor in a RC-M120EX micro-ultracentrifuge (Sorvall, Newtown, CT), and the pellet was resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on an 8% Tris glycine gel at constant voltage, gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR film at −70 °C for 12–24 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the Pgp band was quantified using the STORM 860 PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and the software ImageQuaNT. Binding of the fluorescent analogue TNP-ATP was measured by determining the increase in fluorescence signal of TNP-ATP in the presence of purified Pgp incorporated into proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes (20–25 μg of protein) were incubated with 100 μm TNP-ATP in ATPase assay buffer in a reaction volume of 200 μl for 10 min at room temperature (22–23 °C) under subdued light. The samples were then transferred to individual wells in a 96-well flat bottom, UV-transparent, disposable microplate (Spectraplate, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and an emission scan (500–600 nm) obtained using excitation at 408 nm on a Spectra MAX 250 Microplate spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The enhancement in fluorescence due to TNP-ATP binding was estimated by running an emission scan of TNP-ATP in the assay buffer in the absence of Pgp. Additionally, to obtain signal specific to Pgp, an equivalent emission scan in the presence of 10 mm ATP (i.e. 100-fold excess) was generated and subtracted from the scan obtained in the absence of ATP. 8-Azido-ATP is a good hydrolysis substrate for both Chinese hamster and human Pgp, with aK m similar to ATP (6Urbatsch I.L. al-Shawi M.K.

Our recent studies (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) show that binding of nucleotide to Pgp per se does not affect its interactions with the substrate, similarly Fig.1 demonstrates that the binding of the nucleotide, [α-32P]8-azido-ATP, is not affected by substrates such as verapamil and cyclosporin A. Earlier work from our laboratory (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Vi-trapped conformation of Pgp binds substrates with at least 30-fold reduced affinity. The data in Fig. 2 A show that if the photoaffinity substrate analogue, [125I]IAAP, is allowed to bind Pgp, which has been treated previously with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-ATP in the presence of Vi at 37 °C (which corresponds to increased trapping of 8-azido-ADP in Pgp), there is a concentration-dependent decrease in substrate binding. A single phase exponential decay model fits the data with aK i = 18 μm for the 8-azido-ATP inhibition of [125I]IAAP binding. It is also clear from these data that for maximal trapping of 8-azido-ADP in the presence of Vi, 0.5 to 1 mm 8-azido-ATP is required. Our earlier work (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and data in Fig. 2 A clearly show that the Pgp·8-azido-ADP·Vi conformation of Pgp exhibits a large decrease in affinity for substrate. This raises the question as to how nucleotide binding to Pgp is affected in the Vi-trapped state (i.e.transition state). To address this question we generated the Pgp·8-azido-ADP·Vi complex in the presence of increasing concentrations of 8-azido-ATP and Vi, washed off excess nucleotide and Vi by centrifugation, and then quantified the extent of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP binding to Pgp. The results of this experiment are graphically depicted in Fig. 2 B. The Vi-induced 8-azido-ADP-trapped conformation of Pgp shows a concentration-dependent decrease in binding of nucleotide, similar to that seen for substrate (Fig. 2 A). A single phase exponential decay model fits the data, and the K i of 8-azido-ATP (during trapping) for the inhibition of nucleotide binding is 12 μm and is comparable to the K iof 8-azido-ATP (during trapping) for the inhibition of [125I]IAAP binding which is 18 μm.Figure 2The Pgp·8-azido-ADP· Vi transition state complex shows reduced affinity for both [125I]IAAP and [α- 32P]8-azido-ATP. A, [125I]IAAP binding to Pgp pretreated with 8-azido-ATP and Vi. Crude membranes (20 μg of protein) were treated with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-ATP (1–1000 μm) and Vi (250 μm) at 37 °C for 10 min in the dark. Excess 8-azido-ATP and Vi were removed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The membranes were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and labeled with 5 nm [125I]IAAP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” [125I]IAAP incorporated in the Pgp band was quantified using a PhosphorImager. B,[α-32P]8-azido-ATP binding to Pgp pretreated with 8-azido-ATP and Vi. Crude membranes (20 μg of protein) were treated with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-ATP and Vi as described inA. Excess 8-azido-ATP and Vi were removed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The membranes were resuspended in ATPase assay buffer and labeled with 10 μm [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (4 μCi/nmol) at 4 °C, as described in “Experimental Procedures.” [α-32P]8-Azido-ATP incorporated in the Pgp band was quantified using a PhosphorImager.

Crude membranes (20 μg of protein) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (5–10 μCi/nmol) at 4 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Excess nucleotide was removed by centrifugation at 300,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The membranes were resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE buffer and electrophoresed on an 8% Tris glycine gel. [α-32P]8-Azido-ATP incorporated in the Pgp band was quantified using a PhosphorImager. Figure shows binding of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP to control (●) membranes and those pretreated with 1.25 mm 8-azido-ATP and 250 μm Vi at 37 °C for 10 min as described in Bto trap Pgp in the transition state conformation (▴).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To quantify the decrease in affinity for nucleotide in the Pgp·8-azido-ADP·Vi complex, we estimated the apparentK d value of 8-azido-ATP for Pgp before and after Vi-induced trapping. Fig. 2 C depicts that [α-32P]8-azido-ATP binding to control membrane vesicles shows saturation; a hyperbola fits the data suggesting a single binding site or more than one site with the same affinity, and theK d of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP was computed to be 13 μm. Pgp previously trapped with Vi (250 μm) and 8-azido-ATP (1.2 mm) on the other hand shows greatly reduced binding of [α-32P]8-azido-ATP, which is not saturable even at a concentration of 100 μm (data not shown). This suggests a large decrease (>30-fold) in the affinity of nucleotide for Pgp in the Vi-trapped conformation. To exclude the possibility that the reduced binding of nucleotide to Pgp in the transition state is an artifact of photoaffinity cross-linking, another approach using the fluorescent nucleotide analogue TNP-ATP was used. TNP-ATP is a hydrolyzable, fluorescent analogue of ATP (17Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Both Chinese hamster and human Pgp can hydrolyze TNP-ATP but at a much slower rate than ATP, and TNP-ATP has also been used to characterize the ATP sites on Pgp (18Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The compound exhibits a low quantum yield in an aqueous medium with an emission maxima at 550 nm (excitation 408 nm), and an increase in quantum yield accompanied by a small blue shift (new emission maxima at 530 nm) occurs when TNP-ATP binds to the ATP sites of Pgp (19Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, when Pgp is pretreated with Vi and 8-azido-ATP at 37 °C to generate the Pgp·8-azido-ADP·Vi complex, there is a marked decrease in the fluorescence (Fig. 3 A) suggesting that the binding of nucleotide (TNP-ATP) to Pgp is drastically reduced, consistent with the results obtained in the experiments with [α-32P]8-azido-ATP (Fig. 2,B and C). The kinetics of inhibition of TNP-ATP binding to Pgp in the presence of ATP and Vi are depicted in Fig. 3 B. Purified, reconstituted Pgp was treated with increasing concentrations of ATP in the presence of Vi at 37 °C for 10 min, and excess ATP and Vi were removed by centrifugation. Extent of TNP-ATP binding to Pgp was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity (Ex = 408 nm and Em = 530 nm). A single phase exponential decay model fits the data with a Ki(ATP) of 83 μm. The results thus far show that following ATP hydrolysis, affinity for nucleotide is considerably reduced. There is considerable evidence in the literature that there is communication between the two ATP sites of Pgp and that mutations or chemical modification of residues in either ATP site precludes ATP hydrolysis (3Ambudkar S.V.

This has led to the hypothesis that there is alternating hydrolysis of ATP at the two ATP sites (9Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 26Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. that nucleotide first binds to one of the two sites but cannot be hydrolyzed. When another nucleotide binds to the second ATP site it promotes hydrolysis at the first site, which in turn powers substrate transport. In the context of our results this raises the following two questions. (a) Does nucleotide binding per se affect Vi-induced trapping? (b) Once ATP hydrolysis ensues, do nucleotides influence the release of ADP from Pgp? To address the first question, we monitored Vi-induced trapping of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP in the presence increasing concentrations of AMPPNP, a nucleotide analogue, that can bind to Pgp but cannot be hydrolyzed (10Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, if binding of nucleotide at one ATP site exerts allosteric control over hydrolysis at the other ATP site, binding of AMPPNP at one site should stimulate Vi-induced trapping at the other site. Fig.4 A, however, clearly demonstrates that AMPPNP inhibits in a dose- dependent manner the Vi-induced trapping of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP with an apparent K i = 1.3 mm. This suggests that binding of nucleotide at one site does not stimulate ATP hydrolysis at the other site. To address the second question, i.e. what controls the release of ADP from Pgp after ATP hydrolysis, we monitored the dissociation of [α-32P]8-azido-ADP from the Pgp·8-azido-ADP·Vi complex. The [α-32P]8-azido-ADP was trapped by incubating crude membranes with [α-32P]8-azido-ATP and Vi at 37 °C for 10 min, and free Vi and nucleotide were removed by centrifugation, and the resuspended membranes were incubated at 37 °C under different conditions. Aliquots were removed at intervals, and excess cold ATP was added to displace the [α-32P]8-azido-ADP dissociated from the complex, and the samples were cross-linked by UV irradiation. Fig. 4 B shows that the [α-32P]8-azido-ADP is completely dissociated within 15 min at 37 °C with at 12 of 2–3 min. The t 12 for dissociation is not influenced by the presence of excess 8-azido-ADP, 8-azido-ATP, ATP, or the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide AMPPNP, added in the presence of Mg2+. The dissociation is, however, strongly temperature-dependent with no appreciable dissociation during a 15-min incubation at room temperature (data not shown). These results suggest that following ATP hydrolysis, ADP dissociates spontaneously and that while in the transition state, ADP or 8-azido-ADP is occluded and not exchangeable with exogenously added nucleotide. The experiments described above demonstrate that the ATP hydrolysis that follows binding of nucleotide and substrate results in a conformational change in Pgp that dramatically lowers the affinity of both substrate and nucleotide and inhibits the binding of additional molecules. Fig.5 A depicts an experimental strategy, described in detail in the legend, to discriminate between the two hydrolysis events postulated to occur in a single catalytic cycle of Pgp (10Sauna Z.E.

Using a functional screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a putative amine oxidase, encoded by FMS1, was found to be rate-limiting for β-alanine and pantothenic acid biosynthesis. Overexpression ofFMS1 caused excess pantothenic acid to be excreted into the medium, whereas deletion mutants required β-alanine or pantothenic acid for growth. Furthermore, yeast genes ECM31 andYIL145c, which both have structural homology to genes of the bacterial pantothenic acid pathway, were also required for pantothenic acid biosynthesis. The homology of FMS1 to FAD-containing amine oxidases and its role in β-alanine biosynthesis suggested that its substrates are polyamines. Indeed, we found that all the enzymes of the polyamine pathway in yeast are necessary for β-alanine biosynthesis; spe1Δ , spe2Δ ,spe3Δ , and spe4Δ are all β-alanine auxotrophs. Thus, contrary to previous reports, yeast is naturally capable of pantothenic acid biosynthesis, and the β-alanine is derived from methionine via a pathway involving spermine. These findings should facilitate the identification of further enzymes and biochemical pathways involved in polyamine degradation and pantothenic acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae and raise questions about these pathways in other organisms.

Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a metabolic precursor to coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl carrier protein, which are cofactors required by a large number of metabolic enzymes. Biosynthesis of pantothenic acid occurs in microbes and plants only, whereas animals obtain it in their diet. In bacteria, it is synthesized by the condensation of pantoate, derived from 2-oxoisovalerate, an intermediate in valine biosynthesis, and β-alanine, produced by the decarboxylation of l-aspartate (1Williamson J.M. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8074-8082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, four genes, panB, panC,panD, and panE, encode the four enzymes required for pantothenic acid biosynthesis, as illustrated in Fig.1 (3Jackowski S. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 687-694Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires exogenous pantothenic acid for growth (4Leonian L.H. Lilly V.G. Am. J. Bot. 1942; 29: 459-464Crossref Google Scholar). This growth requirement can be replaced by β-alanine (5Stolz J. Sauer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18747-18752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This implies that yeast have all the enzymes required for pantothenic acid biosynthesis except for aspartate-1-decarboxylase, the enzyme necessary for β-alanine biosynthesis in E. coli (1Williamson J.M. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8074-8082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a structural homolog of aspartate-1-decarboxylase is absent from the proteome of yeast (6Hodges P.E. McKee A.H.Z. Davis B.P. Payne W.E. Garrels G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), whereas structural homologs of all the other enzymes of the pantothenic acid pathway do exist in yeast. The gene ECM31, thought to be involved in cell wall maintenance (7Lussier M. White A.-M. Sheraton J. di Paolo T. Treadwell J. Southard S.B. et al.Genetics. 1997; 147: 435-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has homology to panB of E. coli andAspergillus nidulans (8Kurtov D. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The gene YIL145c is apanC ortholog, encoding pantothenate synthase, and has been shown to be functional in E. coli (9Genschel U. Powell C.A. Abell C. Smith A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The putativeYHR063c gene has structural homology topanE, as noted in the Yeast Proteome Data base (6Hodges P.E. McKee A.H.Z. Davis B.P. Payne W.E. Garrels G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific absence of a gene for aspartate-1-decarboxylase may appear to be consistent with the observation, first reported almost 60 years ago, that yeast require exogenous pantothenic acid for growth (4Leonian L.H. Lilly V.G. Am. J. Bot. 1942; 29: 459-464Crossref Google Scholar). Decarboxylation of aspartate is not the only pathway for β-alanine biosynthesis. In some E. coli mutants, the source of β-alanine for pantothenic acid biosynthesis involves reduction of uracil to dihydrouracil followed by hydrolysis first to β-ureidoproprionate and second to CO2, NH3, and β-alanine (10Slotnick I.J. Weinfeld H. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74: 122-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, degradation of polyamines by amine oxidases can produce β-alanine (11Hölttä E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Padmanabhan R. Tchen T.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), effectively making β-alanine from methionine (13Large P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 8: 249-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, polyamine metabolism has never been implicated previously in pantothenic acid biosynthesis. We were therefore interested in the putative amine oxidase encoded by the yeast gene FMS1, which was originally identified as a multicopy suppressor of fen2 pantothenic acid import mutants and encodes a protein of 508 amino acids with sequence homology to FAD-containing amine oxidases (14Joets J. Pousset D. Marcireau C. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Pantothenic acid uptake deficiency in fen2 mutants causes CoA limitation, which affects yeast growth primarily by limiting ergosterol biosynthesis, suggesting a related role for FMS1 (5Stolz J. Sauer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18747-18752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Joets J. Pousset D. Marcireau C. Karst F. Curr.

In this report we show that S. cerevisiae can synthesize β-alanine and is therefore capable of de novo biosynthesis of pantothenic acid. Furthermore, the biochemical pathway of β-alanine synthesis differs from that found in bacteria. We have found that β-alanine is formed from spermine via the amine oxidase encoded by FMS1. Thus, the β-alanine moiety of pantothenic acid is derived from methionine via S-adenosylmethionine and the polyamine pathway. These findings should facilitate the elucidation of other enzymes and metabolic intermediates involved in polyamine degradation and pantothenic acid biosynthesis and raise questions about these metabolic pathways in other organisms. The parental yeast strains BY4741 and BY4742 and their gene deletion derivatives (16Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K.

YNB-P had the same recipe as “Yeast Nitrogen Base with ammonium sulfate” (Difco, Detroit, MI), except that pantothenic acid was omitted. Amino acid supplements (18Toyn J.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. White W.H.

Pantothenic acid and other supplements were added to YNB-P as indicated in “Results” and the figure legends. YPD medium was 2% glucose, 2% bactopeptone, and 1% yeast extract (Difco). Pantothenic acid, β-alanine, spermine, spermidine, and putrescine (Sigma) were prepared as stock solutions in water and used in media at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Yeast strain JHT14 was transformed with a yeast high copy library (21Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) and ∼5 × 104 Ura+ transformants were pooled, divided into aliquots, and stored in 25% glycerol at −70 °C. Transformants were then spread at a density of 105 Ura+ cells per 10-cm Petri dish on synthetic agar medium containing 2% glucose, but lacking uracil, adenine, histidine, methionine, and pantothenic acid. After incubation for 3 days at 30 °C, rapidly growing colonies occurred at a frequency of ∼1.5 × 10−4. The rapid growth phenotype of 37 of 55 colonies tested was found to be plasmid-dependent, based on the lack of growth on a selective medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid and uracil (22Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Ten of these plasmids were recovered from yeast by transformation of E. coli and confirmed to confer the rapid growth phenotype on selective medium when reintroduced into yeast strain JHT14. Based on comparison with sequence data in theSaccharomyces Genome Data base, six plasmids contained theABZ1 locus, and four plasmids contained the FMS1locus. The ABZ1 plasmids enhanced growth only because of the low concentration of paraaminobenzoic acid used in the medium, and they were not studied further. E. coli strains DH5α and DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for DNA manipulations by standard methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into yeast using lithium acetate (24Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Yeast DNA isolation for recovery of plasmids in E. coli was carried out using the Yeast Plasmid Isolation kit (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA). The FMS1 coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers Fms1For-Xho (5′-ccctcgagatgaatacagtttcaccag-3′) and Fms1Rev-Bam (5′-ttggatccctatttcagtaagtcag-3′) and ligated into theSalI and BamHI sites of YEp195AC (25Gunyuzlu P.L. White W.H. Davis G.L. Hollis G.F. Toyn J.H. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 15: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to create the ADH1-FMS1 overexpression vector. The E39Q substitution was made using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and mutagenic primers FmsE39Qupper (5′-gtcttgttcttcaggccagagatc-3′) and FmsE39Qlower (5′-gatctctggcctgaagaacaagac-3′). The DNA sequence of the entire mutant open reading frame was confirmed subsequently. Log phase cultures of strain BY4742–10595 (fms1Δ) or strain BY4742–13316 (ecm31Δ) containing vector YEp195AC were prepared in synthetic medium lacking uracil and washed by centrifugation in water, and ∼105 cells were spread on 10-cm Petri dishes containing synthetic agar medium lacking uracil and pantothenic acid. Log phase cultures of strain BY4742 and fen2Δ, fms1Δ, and ecm31Δ deletion derivatives harboring either YEp195AC or the ADH1-FMS1overexpression plasmid were prepared in synthetic medium lacking uracil, washed by centrifugation in water, and spotted onto theecm31Δ and fms1Δ “lawns” at a density of ∼107 cells per 5 μl. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days, after which time “halos” of growing lawn cells formed around spots of cells that excreted pantothenic acid or downstream metabolites into the medium. A high copy yeast genomic DNA library was screened for genes that enhanced growth in the absence of pantothenic acid, and plasmids containing genomic DNA in the region of the FMS1 locus were found. To determine whether FMS1, rather than other DNA sequences in these plasmids, was responsible for the enhanced growth, the FMS1 open reading frame was subcloned into an expression vector under the control of the ADH1 promoter and confirmed to have a DNA sequence identical to the published sequence (Ref. 14Joets J. Pousset D. Marcireau C. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, GenBankTM accession number X81848). This plasmid was introduced into yeast, and it was found that ADH1-FMS1, but not the empty vector, could enhance the growth of yeast on medium lacking pantothenic acid (Fig. 2). As shown above, yeast grew well in the absence of pantothenic acid when FMS1 was overexpressed. This finding prompted us to test the currently available deletion strains, fms1Δ, ecm31Δ,YIL145cΔ, and fen2Δ for pantothenic acid and β-alanine auxotrophy (see Fig. 1). The deletion strains and parental strain BY4742 were plated on medium lacking pantothenic acid and β-alanine or on medium supplemented with these compounds (Fig.3 A). The fms1Δstrain required either pantothenic acid or β-alanine for growth. This is consistent with the results for overexpression of FMS1; overexpression of FMS1 enhanced growth in the absence of pantothenic acid/β-alanine, whereas the fms1Δ deletion totally blocked growth in the absence of pantothenic acid/β-alanine. In the same experiment, the ecm31Δ andYIL145cΔ strains could utilize pantothenic acid but differed from the fms1Δ strain because they could not grow on β-alanine. Neither the fen2Δ nor the parental strain required these supplements. Other potential metabolites, including β-ureidoproprionate, 5,6-dihydrouracil, l-aspartic acid, and 1,3-diaminopropane (100 μm) did not support growth of the deletion strains (data not shown). The same results were also obtained using a different parental strain, BY4741, and its deletion derivatives (data not shown). Thus, based on the auxotrophic phenotypes,FMS1 is required for β-alanine production, whereasECM31 and YIL145c are required downstream in the pantothenic acid pathway (Fig. 1). Further evidence that FMS1 functions in the same pathway asECM31 was obtained from a complementation analysis using theADH1-FMS1 overexpression plasmid. This plasmid was introduced into fms1Δ, ecm31Δ, andfen2Δ strains, which were then tested for growth in the absence of β-alanine (Fig. 3 B). Growth occurred in thefms1Δ and fen2Δ strains, but not theecm31Δ strain, indicating that FMS1 is dependent on ECM31 for pantothenic acid biosynthesis. Thus,S. cerevisiae does not require exogenous pantothenic acid or β-alanine in the medium for growth, and FMS1 activity is rate-limiting for β-alanine biosynthesis under the conditions used. Dramatically increased metabolic activity in the pantothenic acid pathway caused by FMS1 overexpression can be detected in cross-feeding experiments, in which cells excreting excess pantothenic acid cause halos of growth in lawns of pantothenic acid auxotrophs. Dense spots of wild-type,fen2Δ, fms1Δ, and ecm31Δ strains containing either the ADH1-FMS1 overexpression vector or the empty vector were placed on lawns of either ecm31Δ orfms1Δ cells on medium lacking pantothenic acid (Fig.4). After incubation, halos formed around each of the FMS1-overexpressing strains, with the exception of the ecm31Δ strain, on both lawns. No halos formed around strains harboring empty vector. The simplest explanation for the halos is that FMS1 overexpression results in excretion of excess pantothenic acid, which is then taken up by the lawn cells, allowing them to grow. Overexpression of FMS1 in theecm31Δ strain did not result in a halo, further confirming that FMS1 and ECM31 function in the same pathway. Although it is required for β-alanine production,FMS1 encodes a protein that has no structural homology to bacterial aspartate-1-decarboxylases. Instead, Fms1p has homology to FAD-containing amine oxidases (14Joets J. Pousset D. Marcireau C. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and likewise contains a GXGXXG dinucleotide-binding motif similar, for example, to Candida albicans Cbp1p, human monoamine oxidases A and B, and the peroxisomal acetylspermidine oxidase Aso1p of Candida boidinii (Fig.5 A). To assess the role of FAD in β-alanine production, we made the E39Q substitution mutant, equivalent to the substitution that was shown to abolish FAD binding and catalytic activity of monoamine oxidase B (26Kwan S.-W. Lewis D.A. Zhou B.P. Abell C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.-W. Abell C.W. J. Biol.

The resultingADH1-fms1(E39Q) expression plasmid was introduced into thefms1Δ strain, and transformants were tested for growth in the absence of β-alanine and pantothenic acid (Fig. 5 B). The E39Q mutant did not complement the β-alanine and pantothenic acid auxotrophy of the fms1Δ strain, consistent with a role for FAD in the mechanism of β-alanine production. The sequence homology of Fms1p to amine oxidases and the apparent role of FAD in β-alanine production by Fms1p suggested that polyamines could provide the substrates for Fms1p. We therefore tested deletion mutants of the polyamine pathway (29Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar, 30Glansdorff N. Neidhardt F.C.

Parental, spe1Δ, spe2Δ,spe3Δ, spe4Δ, fms1Δ, andecm31Δ strains were plated on medium lacking pantothenic acid, β-alanine, and polyamines or on medium supplemented with pantothenic acid, β-alanine, spermine, spermidine, or putrescine (Fig. 6). All four of thespeΔ mutants were able to grow when one of the compounds spermine, β-alanine, or pantothenic acid was added to the medium. In addition, spe1Δ and spe3Δ could also grow on spermidine, and spe1Δ could grow on putrescine. As expected, the fms1Δ and ecm31Δ strains could grow on pantothenic acid but could not utilize any of the polyamine compounds. Thus, biosynthesis of β-alanine and pantothenic acid is dependent on the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, consistent with production of β-alanine via polyamine degradation (11Hölttä E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Padmanabhan R. Tchen T.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 13Large P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 8: 249-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The source of the carbon atoms in β-alanine would therefore be from methionine via spermine. Based on these results, the relationship of the polyamine pathway to pantothenic acid biosynthesis and the key genes involved are illustrated in Fig. 7. The speΔ strains were not able to grow on the potential polyamine degradation metabolite 1,3-diaminopropane (data not shown), apparently ruling out this compound as an intermediate in β-alanine biosynthesis.Figure 7The pantothenic acid pathway in yeast. A, the diagram shows the relationship of yeast genes to pantothenic acid biosynthesis, inferred from the experiment in Fig. 6.

The bold lines represent the three-carbon moiety that is derived from methionine in yeast.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Yeast have been reported to require a supplement of either pantothenic acid or β-alanine, from which it has been inferred that they cannot synthesize pantothenic acid de novo (4Leonian L.H. Lilly V.G. Am. J. Bot. 1942; 29: 459-464Crossref Google Scholar, 5Stolz J. Sauer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18747-18752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Contrary to this, we found that overexpression of the yeast geneFMS1, encoding a putative amine oxidase, allowed strong growth on medium lacking pantothenic acid. Furthermore, whenFMS1 was overexpressed under the control of theADH1 promoter, excess pantothenic acid was excreted from the cells. Thus, yeast clearly have the capacity to synthesize pantothenic acid de novo when FMS1 is overexpressed. To eliminate the possibility that the pantothenic acid biosynthesis was a metabolic abnormality caused by FMS1 overexpression, we analyzed gene deletion mutants. The fms1Δ strains were auxotrophic for β-alanine and could grow when supplemented with either β-alanine or pantothenic acid. Deletions in genes that have structural homology to the bacterial genes of the pantothenic acid pathway, ECM31 and YIL145c (see Fig. 1), caused pantothenic acid auxotrophy, but these strains did not grow on a β-alanine supplement, indicating that these genes are downstream in the pathway (see Fig. 1). These auxotrophic phenotypes indicate thatFMS1, ECM31, and YIL145c are normally involved in pantothenic acid biosynthesis. Direct evidence thatFMS1 and ECM31 are in the same pathway came from the finding that FMS1 requires ECM31 activity to make pantothenic acid; the ecm31Δ deletion eliminated both the ability of FMS1 to enhance growth in the absence of pantothenic acid and also eliminated its ability to cause pantothenic acid excretion. Thus, pantothenic acid biosynthesis is a natural part of metabolism in S. cerevisiae, and production of the β-alanine required involves a putative amine oxidase, encoded byFMS1. Three different enzymatic pathways have been shown to produce β-alanine: decarboxylation of aspartate (1Williamson J.M. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8074-8082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cronan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), degradation of pyrimidines (10Slotnick I.J. Weinfeld H. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 74: 122-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and degradation of polyamines (13Large P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 8: 249-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyamine pathway has not been implicated previously in pantothenic acid biosynthesis, and spermine, in particular, has no previously identified physiological function in yeast (31Hamasaki-Katagiri N. Katagiri Y. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Gene. 1998; 210: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The involvement of the polyamine pathway is suggested by the Fms1p amino acid sequence, which has structural homology to FAD-containing amine oxidases (14Joets J. Pousset D. Marcireau C. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), some of which are involved in the oxidative degradation of polyamines (4Leonian L.H. Lilly V.G. Am. J. Bot. 1942; 29: 459-464Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that a FAD binding site mutant of FMS1, E39Q, did not complement the fms1Δ mutant, consistent with a role for oxidation by the Fms1p protein. We therefore investigated deletion mutants of the polyamine pathway to see whether this pathway is required for β-alanine synthesis. Indeed, spe1Δ,spe2Δ, spe3Δ, and spe4Δ mutants were all auxotrophic for β-alanine on a medium that lacked polyamines. This showed that synthesis of spermine is required for β-alanine biosynthesis in yeast. A more detailed analysis of which polyamine pathway intermediates could support growth of thespeΔ and fms1Δ mutants confirmed this conclusion (Fig. 6). Thus, in yeast, β-alanine is derived from methionine via spermine, making polyamine degradation part of pantothenic acid biosynthesis (Fig. 7). We found that the auxotrophic phenotypes of the speΔmutants for polyamines were readily observable on minimal synthetic medium in the absence of β-alanine or pantothenic acid (Fig.6). This contrasts with previous reports, in which special precautions in medium preparation were required, such as HCl washing of glassware and avoidance of autoclave use, to eliminate contaminating amines, and in which many cell divisions were required to deplete intracellular pools of polyamines (32Balasundaram D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5872-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The difference is simply in the presence or absence of β-alanine or pantothenic acid; in their absence, a relatively high level of polyamine metabolism is required to meet β-alanine requirements, such that contaminated glassware and intracellular pools do not make a significant contribution. In the presence of β-alanine or pantothenic acid, as customary in yeast media, low levels of contaminating polyamines are sufficient for essential processes, such as hypusine synthesis (33Park M.H. Joe Y.A. Kang K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which are unrelated to the pantothenic acid pathway. Amine oxidases have been shown to catalyze a number of different degradation reactions for polyamines, producing various aldehydes and amines, such as 3-aminopropanal and 1,3-diaminopropane, respectively (13Large P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 8: 249-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the simplest hypothesis is that the Fms1p enzyme converts spermine to 3-aminopropanal and spermidine and that aldehyde dehydrogenases, for which there are seven genes in yeast (34Wang X. Mann C.J. Bai Y. Ni L. Weiner H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 822-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), would be required to convert the 3-aminopropanal to β-alanine. A less direct route between spermine and β-alanine could, in principle, involve the intermediate 1,3-diaminopropane (13Large P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 8: 249-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this compound was not able to support growth of the speΔ mutants in the absence of β-alanine and therefore appears not to be on the pathway in yeast. The simple phenotype of β-alanine auxotrophy in yeast will help identify the metabolic intermediates and additional enzymes involved. It may seem unexpected that yeast would have the capacity to make pantothenic acid and yet require a supplement for efficient growth on customary yeast media. In fact, on medium containing glycerol or acetate as the sole carbon source, we found that pantothenic acid and β-alanine were not rate-limiting for growth (data not shown). Thus, FMS1activity is growth-limiting only on glucose medium. This simple observation may explain the carbon source-dependent phenotype (catabolite repression) reported for the fen2pantothenate transporter mutant (15Marcireau C. Joets J. Pousset D. Guilloton M. Karst F. Yeast. 1996; 12: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the light of the finding that pantothenic acid biosynthesis is a natural part of yeast metabolism, we propose that growth of the fen2 mutant, which cannot absorb pantothenic acid from the medium, depends on pantothenic acid synthesis inside the yeast cells. The fen2 mutant would therefore be growth-limited on glucose because of insufficient FMS1expression caused by the presence of glucose. Likewise, wild-type strains would depend on internal synthesis when pantothenic acid was absent from the medium and would be growth-limited by insufficientFMS1 expression on glucose medium. These observations suggest that FMS1 activity is regulated and raise questions concerning the mechanism of regulation of the pantothenic acid pathway in yeast. The finding that β-alanine biosynthesis is different between yeast and bacteria raises questions as to how other organisms, such as fungi and plants, make β-alanine. At the present time in the public sequence data bases there are over a dozen identifiable aspartate-1-decarboxylase genes from different prokaryotic species, whereas this enzyme does not appear to be present in eukaryotic species. In contrast, proteins of significant sequence homology to Fms1p can be found in eukaryotes, in particular in plants, but not in prokaryotes. The closest sequence similarity to Fms1p is in Cbp1p from the yeast C. albicans, a protein with steroid binding activity (14Joets J. Pousset D. Marcireau C. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Malloy P.J. Zhao X. Madani M.D. Feldman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests that plants and lower eukaryotes generally produce β-alanine and hence CoA by a polyamine degradation pathway, as described here for yeast. We thank our colleagues at DuPont Pharmaceuticals: Greg Hollis, Karyn O'Neil, and Shaoxian Sun for their critical evaluation and help in writing the manuscript and Julie Bunville, Karen Krakowski, and Laura Bolling for DNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2133636845,"Attempts to estimate the time of origin of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 by using phylogenetic analysis are seriously flawed because of the unequal evolutionary rates among different viral lineages. Here, we report a new method of molecular clock analysis, called Site Stripping for Clock Detection (SSCD), which allows selection of nucleotide sites evolving at an equal rate in different lineages. The method was validated on a dataset of patients all infected with hepatitis C virus in 1977 by the same donor, and it was able to date exactly the known origin of the infection. Using the same method, we calculated that the origin of HIV-1 group M radiation was in the 1930s. In addition, we show that the coalescence time of the simian ancestor of HIV-1 group M and its closest related cpz strains occurred around the end of the XVII century, a date that could be considered the upper limit to the time of simian-to-human transmission of HIV-1 group M. The results show also that SSCD is an easy-to-use method of general applicability in molecular evolution to calibrate clock-like phylogenetic trees."

Based on these observations, a central role is suggested for TgCDPK1 in regulatingToxoplasma motility and host cell invasion. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa. Infection with this parasite is typically asymptomatic, although acute toxoplasmosis can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals and result in severe birth defects or abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy (1Frenkel J.K. Parasitol. Today.. 1988; 4: 273-278Google Scholar). Three developmental stages of Toxoplasma have been described. The highly infective sporozoite stage is shed in the feces of infected felines and can infect all warm-blooded animals, where it differentiates into the rapidly replicating tachyzoite stage. This form of the parasite rapidly spreads throughout the infected animal and eventually differentiates into the slow growing, encysted bradyzoite stage. The latter can infect another animal upon ingestion of infected tissues. The three stages are immunologically and biochemically distinct, due to the expression of many stage-specific proteins (2Bohne W. Holpert M. Gross U. Immunobiology.. 1999; 201: 54-248Google Scholar). All three developmental stages are obligate intracellular parasites, suggesting that infected host cells supply nutrients that supplementT. gondii biosynthetic deficiencies, such as its inability to make purines de novo (3Pfefferkorn E.R. Wyler D.J. Modern Parasite Biology: Cellular, Immunological and Molecular Aspects.W. H. Freeman and Co. 1990; : 26-50Google Scholar). As a result of these biosynthetic requirements, invasion of a host cell is critical for the growth and reproduction of T. gondii. The biochemical pathways involved in host cell invasion have not yet been identified, although it has been shown that cytoplasmic calcium in the parasite is essential for this process (4Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol... 1999; 31: 421-428Google Scholar, 5Pezzella N. Bouchot A. Bonhomme A. Pingret L. Klein C. Burlet H. Balossier G. Bonhomme P. Pinon J.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol... 1997; 74: 92-101Google Scholar). The involvement of calcium in regulating parasite interaction with host cells was further strengthened by the observation of Sibley et al. that both the attachment of Toxoplasma tachyzoites to its host cells as well as parasite motility are sensitive to an inhibitor of calcium-dependent protein kinases, KT5926 (6Hashimoto Y.

Three major classes of protein kinases are often involved in this: cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, and calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases.

These enzymes, the calmodulin-like domain protein kinases (CDPKs),1 are activated by calcium in the absence of calmodulin or phospholipids.

Parasitology.. 1996; 113: 439-448Google Scholar). The typical CDPK domain structure consists of an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain homologous to that of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, followed by a highly conserved junction domain, which joins the kinase region to a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (10Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science.. 1991; 252: 951-954Google Scholar). This calmodulin-like domain, which is 30–40% homologous to calmodulin, imparts calcium sensitivity to the CDPKs (19Lee J.Y. Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 6801-6809Google Scholar, 20Zhao Y. Pokutta S. Maurer P. Lindt M. Franklin R.M. Kappes B. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 3714-3721Google Scholar). Activation of CDPKs has been shown to be dependent on calcium and independent of calmodulin (8Harmon A.C. Putnam-Evans C. Cormier M.J. Plant Physiol... 1987; 83: 830-837Google Scholar). The elucidation of the function of specific CDPKs has been complicated, in part, by the fact that often multiple isoforms are expressed at the same time (19Lee J.Y. Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 6801-6809Google Scholar). Three soybean isoforms were found to differ in sensitivity to calcium and substrate specificity (19Lee J.Y. Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 6801-6809Google Scholar), suggesting that they are involved in the regulation of different phenomena. In plants, CDPKs have been found to regulate Ca2+-pumps (21Hwang I. Sze H. Harper J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 6224-6229Google Scholar), K+-transport (22Li J. Lee Y.R. Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol... 1998; 116: 785-795Google Scholar), and a Cl− channel (23Pei Z.M. Ward J.M. Harper J.F. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J... 1996; 15: 6564-6574Google Scholar) and have also been implicated in the response to environmental stress and infections (24Romeis T. Piedras P. Jones J.D. Plant Cell.. 2000; 12: 803-816Google Scholar, 25Saijo Y. Hata S. Kyozuka J. Shimamoto K. Izui K. Plant J... 2000; 23: 319-327Google Scholar). The role of CDPKs in protists and apicomplexan parasites is unclear at this time. In light of the importance of calcium-dependent regulation in host cell invasion by Toxoplasma tachyzoites and the suggestion that this might be affected in the presence of KT5926, we performed an analysis of calcium-dependent protein kinase activities in tachyzoites and their sensitivity to KT5926. We describe here the identification of two CDPKs, TgCDPK1 and TgCDPK2, in T. gondii. Of these, only TgCDPK1 is expressed in the tachyzoite stage of the parasite. This enzyme appears to be the target of KT5926 in tachyzoites and is therefore likely to play a role in their invasion of host cells. T. gondiistrain RH(EP) was obtained from D. S. Roos (University of Pennsylvania) and was maintained by serial passage in human foreskin fibroblasts or in the peritoneal cavity of Swiss/Webster mice as has been described (26Beckers C.J. Dubremetz J.F. Mercereau P.O. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol... 1994; 127: 947-961Google Scholar). Parasites were harvested from the culture supernatant or the peritoneal fluid, washed by centrifugation, and filtered through a 3-μm filter before use. These were essentially performed as described by Dobrowolski et al. (7Dobrowolski J.M. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol... 1997; 26: 163-173Google Scholar). For attachment and invasion assays, parasites were added to confluent coverslips of human foreskin fibroblast cells at a concentration of 106/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of increasing concentrations of KT5926 (Calbiochem) or Me2SO. Attachment and invasion were allowed to occur for 15 min at 37 °C. All subsequent operations were performed on ice. The coverslips were gently washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove any unattached parasites. Extracellular parasites were detected by incubation with an anti-Toxoplasma rabbit antiserum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After a 30-min incubation, the coverslips were washed as before. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and permeabilized for 5 min in ice-cold methanol. Both extracellular and intracellular parasites were detected using the mouse monoclonal antibody T41E5 (obtained from Dr. J. F. Dubremetz (Institut Pasteur, Lille, France)) to the parasite surface marker SAG1. Cells were washed and incubated in the secondary antibody solution containing fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to label nuclei. After washing and mounting, the number of attached parasites, total parasites, and host cell nuclei were counted in eight individual fields at × 1000 magnification. All incubations were performed in triplicate. Attachment and invasion were expressed as the number of events observed per host cell nucleus. Parasites were washed and filtered as described above but using phosphate-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. In a final volume of 450 μl, 4.5 × 107 parasites were mixed with 0.5 mCi [32P]sodium phosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To one 200-μl aliquot 4 μl of Me2SO was added, and to a second aliquot 4 μl of 500 μm KT5926 was added. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the parasites were recovered by centrifugation and solubilized in 40 μl of isoelectric focusing sample buffer (5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 9.2 m urea, 2% IGEPAL CA-630, 3% ampholytes 5–8, 2% ampholytes 3–10, and 2% ampholytes 3–5). Samples of 10 μl were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. All experiments were performed in duplicate. All manipulations were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Parasites, prepared as described above, were resuspended to a final concentration of 109 parasites/ml in 25 mmHEPES-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin at pH 7.5. Parasites were disrupted either by two rapid freeze-thaw cycles, by brief sonication, or by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Heat-treated extracts were prepared by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min, and denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation. A 2-ml aliquot of a parasite lysate prepared by sonication was loaded onto a 2 × 1-cm DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, and bound protein was eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 50–500 mm KCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Each 1-ml fraction was analyzed for the presence of protein kinase activity as described below. The three fractions containing the peak of calcium-dependent, KT5926-sensitive protein kinase activity were pooled, and KCl was added to a final concentration of 2m. This was loaded onto a 2 × 1-cm phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 2 m KCl. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 2 to 0 m KCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and protein kinase activity in each fraction was determined as described below. Kinase assays were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1.93 mm CaCl2 (2.5 μm free calcium), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 μg/ml (∼5 nm) purified TgCDPK1. The purified enzyme was diluted in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For assays during enzyme purification, 0.2 mg/ml histones III-S and 90 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼200 Ci/mol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. To assess calcium-dependent activity of the enzyme, the reactions were performed in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, or the concentration of free calcium reactions was controlled by a series of buffers containing a ratio of EGTA/CaCl2 according to Fabiato (27Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol... 1988; 157: 378-417Google Scholar). Where indicated, KT5926, calphostin C, and fluphenazine-N-2-chloroethane (all from Calbiochem) were included in the kinase reaction at the indicated concentrations. For kinetic analysis, the concentrations of peptide/protein substrates and [γ-32P]ATP were varied according to Table I. Control reactions for ATP titrations contained 25 mm EGTA, while controls for peptide titrations lacked peptide substrate. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, transferred immediately to an ice-water bath, and sampled by spotting 10 μl on a 2.5-cm P-81 filter paper (Whatman). Filters were air-dried and washed with constant shaking for 30 min in five changes of 75 mm o-phosphoric acid followed by 5 min in 100% acetone. Filters were air-dried, and Cerenkov radiation was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter.Table IKinetic parameters of TgCDPK1SubstrateK m(app)V max(app)ATP155 μm5.2 μmol min−1 mg−1Glycogen synthase peptide107 μm5.3 μmol min−1 mg−1Syntide-2 peptide84 μm8.9 μmol min−1 mg−1Histones III-S3 mg/ml1.0 μmol min−1mg−1Protamine sulfate0.2 mg/ml6.5 × 10−3 μmol min−1 mg−1ATP titration was performed with 400 μm GS peptide and a dilution series of 400–50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (20–800 Ci/mol). GS peptide titration was carried out in 400 μm ATP. All other peptide titrations were carried out in 200 μm ATP. Kinetic values are derived from Eadie-Hofstee plots of data obtained. Open table in a new tab ATP titration was performed with 400 μm GS peptide and a dilution series of 400–50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (20–800 Ci/mol). GS peptide titration was carried out in 400 μm ATP. All other peptide titrations were carried out in 200 μm ATP. Kinetic values are derived from Eadie-Hofstee plots of data obtained. Values for K m and V max were obtained by analyzing data according to Eadie-Hofstee and Lineweaver-Burk. Each reaction contained 10 μl of parasite extract, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm MgCl2, 75 μm [γ-32P]ATP (950 Ci/mol) in a final volume of 20 μl and was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Where indicated, reactions contained either 2 mm EGTA or 2.5 μm free Ca2+ and 200 ng of active recombinant TgCDPK1. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 60 μl of isoelectric focusing sample buffer. For the first dimension, 10-μl samples were loaded onto 7-cm isoelectric focusing gels containing 9.2 m urea, 3% acrylamide, 2% IGEPAL CA-630, 3% ampholytes 5–8, 2% ampholytes 3–10, and 2% ampholytes 3–5. Isoelectric focusing was performed for 14 h at 400 V, followed by 1 h at 800 V. After extrusion and a 15-min equilibration in SDS sample buffer, the tube gels were layered onto 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Following electrophoresis, the SDS-PAGE gels were dried, and autoradiography was used to detect 32P-labeled proteins. Total RNA was isolated from parasites with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) using the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and either random hexamers or oligo(dT) according to the manufacturer's directions. The resulting cDNA was analyzed for the presence of protein kinase-related sequences using PCR and two primers derived from conserved domains present in a wide variety of serine/threonine protein kinases: TgPK1 (5′-CGGATCCAYMGIGAYYT-3′) and TgPK2 (5′-GGAATTCCRWARGACCAIACRTC-3′). A typical 100-μl PCR contained 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, 100 pmol of primers TgPK1 and -2, 50 ng of cDNA, 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 0.001% gelatin. The following PCR conditions were used: 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 37 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. PCR fragments of the expected size were isolated from agarose gels and cloned directly into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones containing inserts were identified, and the inserts were sequenced manually with Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TgCDPK1- and TgCDPK2-specific probes were prepared by PCR in 50-μl reactions containing 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 100 pmol of primers TgPK1 and TgPK2, 50 ng of plasmid template, 200 μm dGTP, dTTP, dATP, and 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP (>3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 0.001% gelatin. For the TgCDPK1 probe, plasmid pTgPK54 was used; for the TgCDPK2 probe, the plasmid pTgPK21 was used. The following PCR conditions were used: 10 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 37 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. A Toxoplasma cDNA library in λZAPII (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, McKesson Biosciences, Rockville, MD) was screened with TgCDPK1- or TgCDPK2-specific probes. Positive phage clones were converted to plasmids using in vivo excision according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The resulting clones were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and automated DNA sequence analysis (Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Sequences were aligned employing the ClustalW algorithm, available through the Baylor University site on the World Wide Web. The phylogeny was developed from the aligned sequence data employing the branch and bound algorithm available in the PAUP program package (28Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony.Sinauer Associates Sunderland, MA. 1998; Google Scholar). In undertaking the analysis, gaps introduced during the alignment process were not considered as character states, all characters were equally weighted, and the phylogenies were not rooted. A single most parsimonious tree was identified in the branch and bound algorithm, which is shown here. Of the 632 characters analyzed, 363 were informative. The statistics for the tree are as follows: length, 2015 (minimum 1752, maximum 2672); consistency index, 0.869; rescaled consistency index, 0.621. Numbers at the nodes indicate the percentage the grouping distal to the labeled node was identified in a bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicate data sets. The entire open reading frames of TgCDPK1 and -2 were amplified using the following primers: 5′-GAAGATCTGATGGGGCAGCAGGAAAGCAC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTTAGTTTCCGCAGAGCTTC-3′ for TgCDPK1; 5′-CGGGATCCCGCATCACCAGTGCAGCACC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTTTACCCCGTAGCGCGAGG-3′ for TgCDPK2 with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Amplified products were digested withBglII (TgCDPK1) or BamHI (TgCDPK2) andHindIII and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pRSETB digested with BamHI and HindIII, resulting in the plasmids pRSETB-CDPK1 and pRESTB-CDPK2. These plasmids encode the open reading frame of the protein kinases fused at their N terminus to a polyhistidine tag and Xpress tag. For the expression of recombinant protein, these plasmids were transfected into JM109 (DE3). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in 200 ml of fresh LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C untilA 600 was 0.4–0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested, lysed in 6m guanidine HCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and loaded onto 2 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer and 20 ml of 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins were eluted using a linear 0–250 mm imidazole gradient in 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing pure fusion proteins were dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline and used as antigen. The entire open reading frame of TgCDPK1 was amplified using the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGGCAGCAGGAAAGCAC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTTAGTTTCCGCAGAGCTTC-3′ and PfuTurbo as described above. The amplified product was purified by agarose electrophoresis, digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI andHindIII, and repurified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The expression plasmid pRSET-B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplification product was ligated into pRSETB, resulting in a construct (pRSETB-TgCDPK1) that encoded only TgCDPK1 without extraneous sequences. A 20-ml overnight culture of Escherichia coli JM109(DE3) containing the plasmid pRSETB-TgCDPK1 was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until an A 600 of 0.8 was reached. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was incubated for an additional 5 h at 37 °C. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 0–4 °C. The pellet (8.1 g) was resuspended in 40 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and after a 10-min incubation the lysate was sonicated on ice. After centrifugation, the clarified supernatant was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. One-fourth of the frozen supernatant was thawed, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 40% saturation. After 1 h, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Additional (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to 60% saturation. After 1 h, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer and dialyzed overnight against two changes of 2 liters of lysis buffer. The dialyzed material was clarified by centrifugation and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (3 × 2 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 30 ml of this buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of NaCl (50–500 mm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Fractions (5 ml) were analyzed for kinase activity as described. The fractions containing the peak of kinase activity were pooled and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Calcium-dependent hydrophobic interaction chromatography was used as the final purification step. The peak fractions of kinase activity were pooled, and CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. This was applied to a (2.5 × 2 cm) phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with loading buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. The column was washed with 45 ml of loading buffer followed by 45 ml of wash buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mmCaCl2). The enzyme was eluted with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EGTA. Fractions (2.5 ml) were assayed for kinase activity as described. Purity of the recombinant protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 60 min at 100 V. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Rabbit or mouse antisera raised against purified TgCDPK1 and TgCDPK2 was used at a 1:2000 dilution in the blocking buffer. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antisera and the SuperSignal detection system (Pierce). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem... 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. It was reported by Dobrowolski et al. (7Dobrowolski J.M. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol... 1997; 26: 163-173Google Scholar) that the protein kinase inhibitor KT5926 blocked the ability of T. gondii to attach to their host cell and to move over substrates. We confirmed these findings, as can be seen in Fig. 1, and established that the IC50 of KT5926 forToxoplasma attachment is ∼100 nm. KT5926 is a selective inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent and myosin light chain kinases in animal cells. To determine the extent to which KT5926 blocks protein phosphorylation in T. gondii, tachyzoites were incubated with inorganic radioactive phosphate in the presence or absence of KT5926. As a control, we also performed an in vivo phosphorylation experiment in the presence of staurosporine, a general inhibitor of serine/threonine protein kinases. To obtain the highest possible sensitivity, the effect of the inhibitor on incorporation of [32P]PO 43− in proteins was assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As expected, the addition of staurosporine blocks incorporation of 32P into most proteins (data not shown). The addition of KT5926 to parasites, as seen in Fig. 2, selectively blocks the incorporation of phosphate in three major proteins: PP1 (M r(app) = 67,000, pI = 6.7), PP2 (M r(app) = 31,000, pI = 5.6), and PP3 (M r(app) = 6500, pI = 4.7). These data suggest that the effect of KT5926 on protein phosphorylation inT. gondii is quite selective and might be due to an inhibition of one or only a few protein kinases. Although the IC50 of KT5926 for parasite attachment is only 100 nm, the in vivo phosphorylation experiment in Fig. 2 was performed in the presence of 10 μm inhibitor to exacerbate its effects on protein phosphorylation. A similar effect of KT5926 on protein phosphorylation was observed at a concentration of 1 μm. To characterize the effects of KT5926 on protein kinase activity in Toxoplasma tachyzoites further, we analyzed parasite extracts for the presence of protein kinase activities. As can be seen in Fig. 3, protein kinase activity is readily detected in Toxoplasmaextracts using histones as substrates. Since KT5926 is thought to be specific for calcium-dependent protein kinase (6Hashimoto Y. Nakayama T. Teramoto T. Kato H. Watanabe T. Kinoshita M. Tsukamoto K. Tokunaga K. Kurokawa K. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1991; 181: 423-429Google Scholar), we determined whether the presence or absence of calcium affects protein kinase activity in Toxoplasma extracts. In the presence of calcium, overall protein kinase activity in parasite extracts was stimulated 2-fold when compared with reactions performed in the presence of EGTA. These data suggest that Toxoplasmaextracts do indeed contain one or more potent calcium-dependent protein kinases. The calcium-dependent increase in protein kinase activity was completely blocked in the presence of 500 nm KT5926, confirming the hypothesis that this inhibitor targets one or more calcium-dependent protein kinases in Toxoplasma. The addition of recombinant Toxoplasma calmodulin, a calmodulin antagonist, or calphostin C had no effect on the KT5926-sensitive protein kinase activity. These observa"

Hyp glycosylation occurs in two modes: Arabinosylation adds short oligoarabinosides (Hyp-arabinosides) while galactosylation leads to the addition of larger arabinogalactan polysaccharides (Hyp-polysaccharides). We hypothesize that sequence-dependent glycosylation of small peptide motifs results in glycomodules. These small functional units in combination with other repetitive peptide modules define the properties of HRGPs. The Hyp contiguity hypothesis predicts arabinosylation of contiguous Hyp residues and galactosylation of clustered noncontiguous Hyp residues. To determine the minimum level of Hyp contiguity that directs arabinosylation, we designed a series of synthetic genes encoding repetitive (Ser-Pro2)n, (Ser-Pro3)n, and (Ser-Pro4)n. A signal sequence targeted these endogenous substrates to the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi for post-translational proline hydroxylation and glycosylation in transformed Nicotiana tabacum cells. The fusion glycoproteins also contained green fluorescence protein, facilitating their detection and isolation. The (Ser-Pro2)n and (Ser-Hyp4)n fusion glycoproteins yielded Hyp-arabinosides but no Hyp-polysaccharide. The motif (Ser-Pro3)n was incompletely hydroxylated, yielding mixed contiguous/noncontiguous Hyp and a corresponding mixture of Hyp-arabinosides and Hyp-polysaccharides. These results plus circular dichroic spectra of the glycosylated and deglycosylated (Ser-Pro2)n, (Ser-Pro3)n, and (Ser-Pro4)n modules corroborate the Hyp contiguity hypothesis and indicate that Hyp O-glycosylation is indeed sequence-driven.

The major post-translational modifications of HRGPs, proline hydroxylation and subsequent O-Hyp glycosylation, determine the properties of HRGPs to a greater or lesser extent. Carbohydrate accounts for as much as 95% of the hyperglycosylated AGPs and about 60% of extensins, thus forming the interactive molecular surface. In the lightly glycosylated PRPs, however, sugar may contribute as little as 1% of the mass. O-Hyp glycosylation occurs in two distinct modes, Hyp arabinosylation (4Lamport D.T.A. Nature. 1967; 216: 1322-1324Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and Hyp galactosylation (5Lamport D.T.A. Loewus F.A. Runeckles V.C. Recent Advances in Phytochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1977: 79-115Google Scholar), respectively. Hyp arabinosylation of virtually all HRGPs results in short (usually 1–4 residues), neutral, linear homooligosaccharides ofl-arabinofuranose (Hyp-arabinosides). Hyp galactosylation, which is restricted to the AGPs, results in addition of much larger arabinogalactan heteropolysaccharides (Hyp-polysaccharides) (5Lamport D.T.A. Loewus F.A. Runeckles V.C. Recent Advances in Phytochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1977: 79-115Google Scholar). These consist of a β-1→3-linked galactan backbone (6Aspinall G.O. Malloy J.A. Craig J.W.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 1070Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with 1→6-linked side chains (7Defaye J. Wong E. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 150: 221-231Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) containing galactose, arabinose, and often rhamnose and glucuronic acid. Each HRGP possesses its own unique Hyp-glycoside profile based on the number of Hyp residues glycosylated and the type of carbohydrate side chains. It is therefore of interest to know what directs the glycosylation. Do the Hyp glycosyltransferases recognize precise sequences or a general conformation? Previously identified peptide sequences and corresponding Hyp-glycoside profiles of selected HRGPs indicated that arabinosylation is correlated with Hyp contiguity. This led to the Hyp contiguity hypothesis (1Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) that predicts arabinosylation of contiguous Hyp residues (8Kieliszewski M.J. O'Neill M. Leykam J.F. Orlando R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2541-2549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and, as its corollary, the galactosylation of clustered noncontiguous Hyp residues, hence the view of an HRGP as an assemblage of glycomodules. These are small, repetitive functional units putatively involved in molecular recognition and wall self-assembly, ultimately contributing to higher level functions like cell wall porosity, tensile strength, and cell extension. Examples of contiguous Hyp arabinosylation range from dipeptidyl Hyp in the Pro-Hyp-Hyp-Val-Tyr-Lys repetitive glycomodule of a PRP (8Kieliszewski M.J. O'Neill M. Leykam J.F. Orlando R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2541-2549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Kieliszewski M. de Zacks R. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to the tetraHyp blocks in the Ser-Hyp4 glycomodule of extensins (10Lamport D.T.A. Katona L. Roerig S. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Fong C. Kieliszewski M.J. de Zacks R. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Until recently, evidence for polysaccharide addition to clustered noncontiguous Hyp, typified by the Xaa-Hyp-Xaa-Hyp motif of AGPs, was only correlative. Therefore, as a direct test we constructed two synthetic genes encoding simple glycomodule repeats for stable expression in transgenic cultures of tobacco cells (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The first result confirmed the predicted O-Hyp galactosylation in the repetitive sequence (Ser-Hyp)32; there was exclusive addition of arabinogalactan polysaccharide to all of the Hyp residues yielding a hyperglycosylated neo-AGP that coprecipitated with the AGP-specific Yariv reagent, thus supporting the glycomodule status of repetitive Ser-Hyp. The second synthetic gene showed that the introduction of contiguous Hyp between the glycomodules of clustered noncontiguous Hyp also introduced arabinosides (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further test the predictive value of the Hyp contiguity hypothesis and the likelihood that other small, conserved repeats direct Hyp glycosylation, such as the commonly occurring Xaa-Hyp-Hyp motif of many AGPs, we designed another set of synthetic genes encoding the putative glycomodules. Here we describe the construction and expression of synthetic genes encoding the repetitive series: Ser-Pro-Pro (SP2), Ser-Pro-Pro-Pro (SP3), and Ser-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro (SP4), assuming that, targeted for secretion, they would be post-translationally hydroxylated in tobacco cells. Arabinosylation of about half of the Hyp residues in the dipeptidyl Hyp blocks and almost 100% of the Hyp of the tetraHyp blocks confirmed the predictive value of this simple contiguity code. However, the repetitive SP3 motif gave an expression product, nominally Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp, but with incompletely hydroxylated Pro residues, which resulted in a mixture of contiguous and noncontiguous Hyp residues. Consistent with the Hyp contiguity hypothesis, the corresponding Hyp-glycoside profile contained both Hyp-arabinosides and Hyp-polysaccharides. Furthermore, circular dichroic spectra of the glycosylated and deglycosylated modules suggested that Hyp arabinosides facilitate the polyproline II conformation of HRGPs, whereas Hyp polysaccharides favor a less ordered conformation. Construction of a given synthetic gene involved three sets of partially overlapping, complementary oligonucleotide pairs (Fig.1) polymerized as described earlier (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,13McGrath K.P. Tirrell D.A. Kawai M. Mason T.L. Fournier M.J. Biotechnol. Prog. 1990; 6: 186-192Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The entire signal sequence-synthetic gene-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) constructs were then subcloned into the plant vector pBI121 (CLONTECH), asBamHI-SstI fragments in place of the glucuronidase reporter gene. All constructs were under control of the 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY) and by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). DNA sequencing was performed at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, The Ohio State University Wooster campus. The pBI121-based plasmids containing the synthetic gene constructs were delivered into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by the freeze-thaw method (14An G. Ebert P.R. Mitra A. Ha S.B. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, Netherlands1988: 1-19Google Scholar), then suspension-cultured tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum, BY2) were transformed with the Agrobacterium as described earlier (15McCormick S. Niedermeyer J. Fry J. Barnason A. Horsch R. Fraley R. Plant Cell Rep. 1986; 5: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown on solid and liquid Schenk-Hildebrandt medium and selected for kanamycin resistance (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). EGFP fluorescence was visualized using a Molecular Dynamics Sarastro 2000 confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscope equipped with an fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set comprising a 488-nm laser wavelength filter, a 510-nm primary beam splitter, and a 510-nm barrier filter. Culture medium from transformed cells was harvested 16–21 days after subculture, concentrated by rotary evaporation, then dialyzed against water and concentrated again by rotary evaporation. Sodium chloride was added to a 2 m final concentration and 40–50 ml of the medium was injected onto a hydrophobic-interaction chromatography column (Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, 16 × 700 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 2 m sodium chloride. We used a decreasing sodium chloride step gradient (2, 1, and 0 m, 150 ml of each) to elute the column at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. Collected fractions (4 ml) were monitored for fluorescence by a Hewlett-Packard 1100 Series flow-through fluorometer (488-nm excitation; 520-nm emission) or by a hand-held UV lamp (365 nm). The fluorescent fractions were pooled, concentrated by freeze-drying, redissolved in 1–2 ml of water, and injected onto a Hamilton semipreparative polymeric reverse phase column (10-μm PRP-1, 7 × 305 mm) equilibrated with start buffer (0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid). Proteins were gradient-eluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/80% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile (0–70%/120 min) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The fusion glycoprotein (Ser-Hyp)32-EGFP and endogenous tobacco AGPs were isolated as described earlier (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein sequence analysis was performed at the Michigan State University Macromolecular Facility on a 477-A Applied Biosystems Inc. gas phase sequencer. We assayed the ability of the fusion glycoproteins, as well as earlier reported (Ser-Hyp)32-EGFP and tobacco AGPs (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), to coprecipitate with the β-glucosyl Yariv reagent (16Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Planta. 1994; 193: 542-550Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Absorbency was read at 420 nm. Hyp-glycoside profiles were determined on 2–4 mg of isolated fusion glycoprotein as described earlier by Lamport and Miller (17Lamport D.T.A. Miller D.H. Plant Physiol. 1971; 48: 454-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Shpak et al. (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We monitored the automated postcolumn hydroxyproline assay at 560 nm. Neutral sugars were analyzed as alditol acetates (18Bhatti T. Chambers R.E. Clamp J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 222: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) by gas chromatography using a 6-foot × 2-mm polyethylene glycol succinate 224 column programmed from 130 to 180° at 4 °C/min for neutral sugars. Data capture was achieved by Hewlett-Packard Chem station software. One hundred micrograms of glycoprotein was used for each analysis. We assayed the uronic acid content of 70 μg of each fusion glycoprotein via the specific colorimetric assay based on reaction with m-hydroxydiphenyl (19Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). Galacturonic acid was the standard. Each fusion glycoprotein (10–20 mg, 10 mg/ml aqueous) was heat-denatured in boiling water for 2 min, cooled, and then incubated in an equal volume of freshly prepared 2% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate containing 2.5 mm calcium chloride and Pronase (substrate:enzyme ratio 100:1, w/w). The digestion proceeded at room temperature overnight, then the peptides were freeze-dried, dissolved in 0.5 ml of Superose buffer, and separated via semipreparative Superose-12 gel filtration (see below). We injected 0.5 ml of tobacco medium from transformed cells (three lines of each construct) onto a Superose-12 analytical gel filtration column (10 × 300 mm) eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and monitored via flow-through detection by a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series fluorometer (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm). The column was calibrated with molecular weight standards (bovine serum albumin, insulin, catalase, and sodium azide) and absorbency was read at 220 nm. Pronased fusion glycoproteins were injected onto a semipreparative Superose-12 column (16 × 500 mm) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For both the analytical and semipreparative Superose-12 columns, the elution buffer was 0.2m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.01% sodium azide. We deglycosylated 4–5 mg of each fusion glycoprotein for 1 h in anhydrous HF as described earlier (20Mort A.J. Lamport D.T.A. Analyt. Biochem. 1977; 82: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The proteins were dialyzed against deionized, distilled water for 2 days at 4 °C and then freeze-dried. The glycomodules were isolated from Pronase digestions of the fusion glycoproteins as described above, then HF-deglycosylated 1 h at 4 °C. The HF was blown off under nitrogen gas, and the deglycosylated modules (designated dSP2, dSP3, dSP4) were then rerun on the reverse-phase column as described above. We recorded CD spectra of poly-l-hydroxyproline (5–20 kDa, Sigma Chemical Co.) and the isolated glycoprotein modules before and after deglycosylation on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). Spectra were averaged over two scans with a bandwidth of 1 nm, and step resolution was 0.1 nm. All spectra are reported in terms of mean residue ellipticity with the 180- to 250-nm region using a 1-mm pathlength. The modules were dissolved in water at the following concentrations: poly-l-hydroxyproline, 18.4 μm; SP, 9.2 μm; SP2, 18.4 μm; SP3, 19.6 μm; and SP4, 30.4 μm. Spectra were obtained from 18.4 μm of each deglycosylated module. We built three plasmids, each encoding a tobacco signal sequence, a synthetic gene, and EGFP placed in one transcriptional frame. The synthetic genes encoded an SP2-EGFP fusion protein containing 24 Ser-Pro2 repeats, an SP3-EGFP glycoprotein containing 15 Ser-Pro3 repeats, and an SP4-EGFP glycoprotein containing 18 Ser-Pro4 repeats. For brevity, from here forward the fusion glycoproteins encoded by the synthetic genes will be referred to as SP2-EGFP, SP3-EGFP, and SP4-EGFP, although most Pro residues were hydroxylated in the glycoproteins. The earlier reported fusion glycoprotein (Ser-Hyp)32-EGFP (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) will be referred to as SP-EGFP. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of tobacco cell cultures gave stably transformed lines, judging by the fact that the cells continue to produce the gene products more than 1 year after transformation. We isolated three lines each of SP2-EGFP, SP3-EGFP, and SP4-EGFP by observing the characteristic fluorescence of EGFP in both the growth medium and the cytoplasm of the transformed cells (not shown), which was similar to that published earlier (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The three lines of each construction were assayed for the fusion glycoproteins by Superose-12 gel permeation chromatography. All lines produced fluorescent products that coeluted with the products visualized in Fig. 2. Two lines of each construction were selected for further characterization of the fusion glycoproteins by Hyp-glycoside profiles. One line of each construction was characterized by protein sequence analysis, amino acid composition, neutral sugar analyses, and circular dichroism. Yields of purified glycoproteins from the most productive cell lines were: SP2-EGFP: 10 mg/liter; SP3-EGFP: 36 mg/liter; SP4-EGFP: 23 mg/liter. The Yariv reagent did not precipitate SP2-EGFP or SP4-EGFP, but it did precipitate SP3-EGFP, although to a much lesser extent than endogenous tobacco AGPs or SP-EGFP (TableI).Table ICoprecipitation of the Ser-Pron-EGFP fusion glycoprotein series with Yariv reagentSample weightTobacco AGP controlSP line ASP2 line ASP3 line ASP4 line AμgAbsorbance at 420 nm501.11.200.401002.22.2Trace0.9TraceThe glycoproteins were precipitated with Yariv reagent, then the precipitate was dissolved in base and the absorbance was measured.

Hyp-glycoside profiles of SP2-EGFP, SP3-EGFP, and SP4-EGFP showed that, although all the glycoproteins contained Hyp-arabinosides, SP3-EGFP glycoprotein also contained Hyp-arabinogalactan polysaccharides (Table II). Arabinose was the only saccharide component of SP2-EGFP and the major saccharide component of SP4-EGFP, which contained a small amount of galactose as well (Table III). In contrast, the SP3-EGFP contained mainly galactose and arabinose, with lesser amounts of rhamnose, glucose, and uronic acid (Table III). Saccharide accounted for 17% of SP2-EGFP, 40% of SP3-EGFP, and 41% of SP4-EGFP on a dry weight basis.Table IIHyp-glycoside profiles of recombinant proteins SP2-EGFP, SP3-EGFP, and SP4-EGFPHyp-glycosideSP2-EGFPSP3-EGFPSP4-EGFPLine ALine BLine ALine BLine ALine B% total HypHyp-polysaccharide00372600Hyp-Ara050536Hyp-Ara2072129812Hyp-Ara3484739365246Hyp-Ara436343030Nonglycosylated Hyp49350076The fusion glycoproteins isolated from each of two lines (A and B) were characterized.

Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 9-14Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab The fusion glycoproteins isolated from each of two lines (A and B) were characterized. Weight loss after HF deglycosylation agreed with the sugar analyses. Thus, from 3.9 mg of SP2-EGFP we recovered 3.3 mg of deglycosylated SP2-EGFP (15% weight loss); from 4.8 mg of SP3-EGFP we recovered 2.6 mg of deglycosylated SP3-EGFP (46% weight loss); and 3.9 mg of SP4-EGFP yielded 2.2 mg of deglycosylated SP4-EGFP (44% weight loss). Amino acid analyses (Table IV) showed that almost all the proline of the SP2 and SP4 glycomodules had been hydroxylated to form Hyp. However, 27% of the proline residues (20 mol % of the amino acids) in the SP3 glycomodule remained nonhydroxylated. Edman degradation (Fig.3) confirmed the identity of the gene products.Table IVAmino acid compositions of isolated glycomodules SP2, SP3, and SP4Amino acidSP2 line ASP3 line ASP4 line Amol %Ser332520Hyp605578Pro7202 Open table in a new tab Both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel permeation chromatography tend to overestimate HRGP molecular mass due to the biased amino acid compositions, extended structures, and extensive glycosylation (21Kieliszewski M.J. Orlando R. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 9-14Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, we calculated the molecular masses of our fusion glycoproteins based on the gene sequences of the constructions (not shown) and their Hyp-glycoside profiles (Table II), amino acid compositions (Table IV), neutral sugar analyses (Table III), and protein sequences (Fig. 3). We calculated the following masses for the glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins: glycosylated SP2-EGFP, 43.9 kDa; dSP2-EGFP, 34.8 kDa; glycosylated SP3-EGFP, 63–77 kDa; dSP3-EGFP, 33.9 kDa; glycosylated SP4-EGFP, 66.4 kDa; and dSP4-EGFP, 37.3 kDa. CD spectra of the deglycosylated modules (Fig.4 A) show that both negative (∼206 nm) and positive (∼226 nm) ellipticities increased in the order dSP (light blue) < dSP2 (yellow) < dSP3 (lavender) < dSP4 (dark green). The glycosylated SP2 and SP3 modules (orange and dark blue, respectively) had virtually identical spectra (Fig. 4 B). Glycosylated SP had a “random coil” conformation (Fig. 4, B and C,red), which adopted more structure afterdeglycosylation (Fig. 4 C, light blue). The negative ellipticities of SP2 and SP4 increased markedly and shifted to a lower wavelength (∼201 nm) when arabinosylated (Fig. 4, D and F,orange and light green, respectively), whereas SP3 showed virtually no change in conformation after deglycosylation (Fig. 4 E, dark blue). Samples containing Hyp-polysaccharide substituents had a second minimum at 180 nm (Fig. 4, B, C, and E,red and dark blue). HRGP glycosylation involves proline-rich sequences targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi for initial cotranslational hydroxylation of the proline residues followed by O-Hyp glycosylation. Generally, the multiplicity and similar properties of HRGPs make them difficult to purify. However, addition of the hydrophobic fluorescent EGFP reporter protein facilitated the chromatographic separation of HRGP-EGFP fusion proteins from the other endogenous, hydrophilic HRGPs. Thus, the design of new HRGPs composed of single glycomodule repeats and expressed as HRGP-EGFP fusion proteins provided bulk quantities of the glycomodules for structural analysis. This approach has allowed us to elucidate the major determinants of Hyp glycosylation and currently is enabling us to determine the detailed structures of the glycosyl substituents. Moreover, as endogenous substrates, these new HRGPs containing only simple repeats can define the enzymic specificity of prolyl hydroxylase(s) and glycosyltransferases under in vivoconditions and prior to isolation of the enzymes. Because proline/hydroxyproline-rich polypeptides often adopt characteristic conformations (Fig. 4) one must ask whether it is primarily peptide conformation or peptide sequence that directs hydroxylation and glycosylation. Prolyl hydroxylase does not hydroxylate all HRGP proline residues, the most notable example being the repetitive “insertion sequence” Val-Lys-Pro-Tyr-His-Pro of tomato P1 extensin. Indeed, in all known HRGP sequences, Lys-Pro always occurs nonhydroxylated, whereas His-Pro is hydroxylated in some HRGPs (22Kieliszewski M.J. Kamyab A. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) but not in others (23Smith J.J. Muldoon E.P. Willard J.J. Lamport D.T.A. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 1021-1030Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and Pro-Val is invariably hydroxylated (1Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The Pro residues in the SP2and SP4 modules (Fig. 3 and Table IV) show almost complete hydroxylation of Pro residues. However, incomplete and inconsistent hydroxylation of SP3 proline residues indicates that the prolyl hydroxylase of Nicotiana has a low affinity for a tripeptidyl proline substrate. Not surprisingly, such sequences are rare in Nicotiana (24Parmentier Y. Durr A. Marbach J. Hirsinger C. Criqui M.-C. Fleck J. Jamet E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although common in other species; for example, repetitive Ser-Hyp3 occurs in the gum arabic glycoprotein of Acacia senegal (25Goodrum L.J. Patel A. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Phytochemistry. 2000; 54: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and in maize extensins (26Rubinstein A.L. Broadwater A.H. Lowrey K.B. Bedinger P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3086-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Likewise, Ser-Pro3 motifs that may be completely hydroxylated occur frequently in potato cDNAs (27Bown D.P. Bolwell G.P. Gatehouse J.A. Gene. 1993; 134: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and in anArabidopsis extensin gene (28Merkouropoulos G. Barnett D.C. Shirsat A.H. Planta. 1999; 208: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The above observations are consistent with sequence-specific hydroxylation rather than the earlier view of plant prolyl hydroxylase as specific for the polyproline II conformation (29Tanaka M. Shibata H. Uchida T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This included protocollagen (30Sadava D. Chrispeels M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which has a polyproline II conformation, although collagen expressed in transgenic tobacco was not hydroxylated (31Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theissen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Plant prolyl hydroxylase is therefore similar to that of animals in being sequence-specific, although it hydroxylates distinctly different sequences. It is also possible that plants, like some animals, have multiple prolyl hydroxylases (1Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) possessing a catalytic domain separate from a sequence-specific peptide substrate binding domain (32Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Other factors may also influence proline hydroxylation of a given substrate. These may include differences in the enzyme specificity of different plant species or the targeting of potential substrates to specific endoplasmic reticulum subdomains, as reported for rice storage proteins (33Choi S.-B. Wang C. Muench D.G. Ozawa K. Franceschi V.R. Wu Y. Okita T.W. Nature. 2000; 405: 765-767Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This may explain why the repetitive Pro-Pro-Pro-Val-His-Leu motif of zein, the maize endosperm seed storage protein that shares sequence identity with the PRP HRGPs, is not hydroxylated (34Rabanal F. Ludevid M.D. Pons M. Giralt E. Biopolymers. 1993; 33: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although the data show that Hyp is the major glycosylation site of HRGPs, it does not rule out the glycosylation of other hydroxyamino acids. Certainly single residues of galactose occur asO-galactosylserine in the Ser-Hyp4 glycomodules of extensin HRGPs (10Lamport D.T.A. Katona L. Roerig S. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Cho Y.-P. Chrispeels M.J. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 165-169Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and may account for the small amount of galactose in the SP4 glycoprotein (Table III), which contains Hyp-arabinosides but no Hyp-polysaccharide. Speculatively, one can suggest that, in concert with the Hyp-arabinosides, galactosylserine stabilizes the Ser-Hyp4 glycomodule. Serine is often considered as a polysaccharide attachment site in the AGPs (36Fincher G.B. Stone B.A. Clarke A.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1983; 34: 47-70Crossref Google Scholar). Although some of the evidence is strongly suggestive (22Kieliszewski M.J. Kamyab A. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,37Baldwin T.C. McCann M.C. Roberts K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is not definitive (38Hillestad A. Wold J.K. Engen T. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 1953-1956Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and is sometimes contradictory (38Hillestad A. Wold J.K. Engen T. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 1953-1956Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 39Karacsonyi S. Patoprsty V. Kubackova M. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 271-279Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 40Bacic A.

Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 224: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, addition of arabinogalactan polysaccharide to the clustered noncontiguous Hyp residues of (Ser-Hyp)n, as previously demonstrated (12Shpak E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14736-14741Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), is a natural corollary of the Hyp contiguity hypothesis. Other clusters can also be defined by the design of synthetic gene constructs that test the efficacy of AGP motifs, such as (Ala-Pro)n, (Thr-Pro)n, and (Ala-Thr-Pro)n, to direct polysaccharide addition. Identification of a sequence motif that directs polysaccharide addition to serine or threonine residues might also be a possible outcome of this work in progress. Because hydroxyproline residues can exist in any one of three states, nonglycosylated, arabinosylated, and galactosylated, a sequence code seems more likely than a purely conformational control of glycosylation. The Hyp contiguity hypothesis predicts the arabinosylation of contiguous Hyp residues, where contiguity begins with dipeptidyl Hyp (8Kieliszewski M.J. O'Neill M. Leykam J.F. Orlando R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2541-2549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), confirmed here by the arabinosylation mainly of a single Hyp residue of each SP2 module (Table II). Interestingly, not only the number of arabinosylated Hyp residues increase with the size of the contiguous Hyp block (about 50% in Ser-Hyp2 and nearly 100% in Ser-Hyp4), but also the size of the attached arabinooligosaccharide. Thus, the small amounts of penta-arabinoside occasionally reported (42Mazau D. Rumeau D. Esquerre-Tugaye M.T. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 540-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) might be attributable to the uncommon Ser-Hyp5–6 motif. Although both the SP3 and SP4 modules were arabinosylated, there was anomalous addition of polysaccharide to SP3, apparently due to incomplete hydroxylation of the proline residues resulting in some clustered noncontiguous Hyp. However, the polyproline II content of deglycosylated SP3is higher than that of the deglycosylated SP2 and much higher than that of the deglycosylated SP (Fig. 4 A). But SP3 contains both Hyp-Ara and Hyp-Gal, whereas SP2 contains Hyp-Ara exclusively, and SP (with the lowest polyproline II content) contains Hyp-Gal exclusively. Thus the CD data support sequence-directed Hyp-glycosylation rather than a simple conformational control based on polyproline II content. The putative Hyp glycosyltransferases clearly distinguish between arabinosylation of contiguous Hyp and galactosylation of clustered noncontiguous Hyp residues. Thus it is now possible to predict the approximate glycosylation profile of an HRGP based on its primary structure, a crucial step toward predicting three-dimensional native structure. However, two exceptions suggest that certain flanking sequences may modify the simple code by suppressing the glycosylation of typical AGP motifs that occur in extensins. For example, the THRGP extensin isolated from maize contains no detectable Hyp arabinogalactan polysaccharide (43Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 823-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but does have a prominent AGP motif flanked by residues that are either bulky, charged, or aromatic: Thr/Tyr-Thr-Hyp-Ser-Hyp-Lys/Pro (44Kieliszewski M.J. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, an extensin isolated from the gymnosperm Douglas fir contained two AGP motifs, both flanked by bulky, charged, or aromatic residues: Hyp/Hyp-Ala-Hyp-Thr-Hyp-Val/Val and Lys/Pro-Ala-Hyp-Ala-Hyp-Tyr/Tyr (11Fong C. Kieliszewski M.J. de Zacks R. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, the glycoprotein contained no arabinogalactan polysaccharide. The (Ser-Pro1–4)n series results in the addition of two very different types of substituent. Hydroxyproline arabinosides have a relatively simple linear structure (45Akiyama Y. Mori M. Kato K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1980; 44: 2487-2489Google Scholar) in contrast to the hydroxyproline arabinogalactan polysaccharide (often described as “highly branched”) that consist of a β-1→3-linked galactose backbone with short side chains, typically a pentasaccharide (7Defaye J. Wong E. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 150: 221-231Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) attached by 1→6-linkages to the main chain (6Aspinall G.O. Malloy J.A. Craig J.W.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 1070Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The role of these substituents is also quite different. A monotonic increase in Hyp/Pro contiguity, represented by the SP, SP2, SP3, and SP4 repetitive modules gave a simple monotonic increase in polyproline II secondary structure, judging from the CD spectra of the deglycosylated modules (Fig. 4 A). However, CD spectra of the intactglycomodules were more complicated. Addition of arabinosides to SP2 and SP4 (Fig. 4, D andF) increased their polyproline II helix content and included a shift of the minimum to a lower wavelength (Fig. 4, B,D, and F). This is particularly evident in SP4 and indicates that a direct interaction between arabinooligosaccharides and the polypeptide backbone facilitates the polyproline II conformation as a slightly modified version. In contrast, Hyp-polysaccharide addition led to a more random coil structure for the SP glycomodule, whereas the addition of both arabinoside and polysaccharide to the SP3 glycomodule did not affect the polyproline II content, presumably because Hyp-arabinosylation favors polyproline II formation whereas the Hyp-polysaccharide opposes it. Polysaccharide addition also resulted in spectra having a new minimum at 180 nm (Fig. 4, B,C, and E) contributed by the polysaccharide substituent itself (Fig. 4). Overall, these CD data confirm that Hyp-arabinosides enhance the polyproline II helix in the Ser-Hyp4 glycomodules of extensin HRGPs (5Lamport D.T.A. Loewus F.A. Runeckles V.C. Recent Advances in Phytochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1977: 79-115Google Scholar, 46Lamport D.T.A. Preiss J. The Biochemistry of Plants.

Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 247-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as they do in the Ser-Hyp2 and Ser-Hyp4 modules here. Presumably, this underlies the contribution of extensin to the tensional integrity of the cell wall itself. On the other hand, judging from the CD spectra, Hyp-polysaccharide does not contribute appreciably to the polypeptide conformation, although the 1→6-linked side chains should greatly enhance the water-holding capacity of AGPs (48Rees D.A. Polysaccharide Shapes. Chapman and Hall, London1977: 41-62Crossref Google Scholar). Hyp-polysaccharide is also a prominent constituent of glypiated AGPs anchored to the plasma membrane where they make a major contribution (49Zhu J.-K Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Planta. 1993; 190: 221-226Google Scholar) as a periplasmic hydrophilic buffer between plasma membrane and cell wall.

Skb1 has been suggested to regulate mitosis negatively and can be functionally replaced with its human homolog (Skb1Hs) in fission yeast (25Gilbreth M. Yang P. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R.A. Kansra S. Gadiraju R. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14781-14786Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this context, an interaction between Skb1Hs and NS3 may play a role in liver diseases caused by HCV. To investigate a function of Skb1Hs interacting with the viral protein, its amino acid sequence was compared with those of genes registered in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. The comparison revealed that the C-terminal domain of Skb1Hs contains an extensive homology to a family of proteins with arginine-specific protein methyltransferase activity.In this study, we focused on the biochemical properties of PRMT5 and found that the arginine residue present in MBP is methylated by PRMT5 and that homo-oligomerization is important for the catalytic activity. A homomeric complex of PRMT5 was detected in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. The homomeric complex of PRMT5 could be separated into a dimer and multimer by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Purified PRMT1 also forms homo-oligomers. PRMT5 forms distinct homo-oligomeric complexes different from those formed by PRMT1, but both covalent and noncovalent associations are involved in the homo-oligomerization of PRMT5 and PRMT1. The homo-oligomeric complexes of PRMT5 and PRMT1, both of which methylate MBP in vitro, may account for the controversial polypeptide compositions of protein-arginine methyltransferases previously purified from cells and tissues (3Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 300: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated here that PRMT5 (Skb1Hs/JBP1) contains an intrinsic protein-arginine methyltransferase activity. First, the conclusion that the catalytic activity of PRMT5 is intrinsic is supported by the facts that primarily the conserved motifs of the known AdoMet-dependent protein-arginine methyltransferases are present in PRMT5 and that spacings between the motifs are not greatly different from those of other PRMTs (Fig. 1). Second, monomethyl- and dimethylarginines were detected in the acid lysate of MBP methylated by PRMT5 (Fig. 2 C). Third, GST-PRMT5 expressed in E. coli, but not GST-PRMT5 domain I mutant, contained the enzyme activity (Fig. 3 A). Finally, the PRMT activities comigrated with the oligomeric complexes of purified FLAG-PRMT5 sedimented on a sucrose gradient (Fig. 5).The presence of a homomeric complex of PRMT5 in vivo was detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). We provide biochemical evidence that the homomeric complex of FLAG-PRMT5 is composed of a dimer and multimer by sedimentation analysis, chemical cross-linking, and SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of a reducing agent (Figs. 5and 6). The oligomerization was not due to a FLAG epitope tagged at the N terminus of PRMT5 because FLAG-PRMT5-C-(308–637) did not form a homo-oligomer (Fig. 6 A). Although the presence of the endogenous PRMT5 multimer in vivo was detected in the protein extract of 293T cells by sedimentation, an endogenous PRMT5 dimer was not detected (Fig. 7). It is likely that cells expressing FLAG-PRMT5 overproduce dimers simply as an intermediate for the formation of multimers. Alternatively, a FLAG epitope tagged at the N terminus of PRMT5 may partially interfere with efficient formation of homo-oligomers larger than dimers. The multimer might be composed of a tetramer, a hexamer, an octamer, and so on. However, sedimentation analyses suggested that endogenous PRMT5 or FLAG-PRMT5 is present most likely as a tetramer (Figs. 5 and 7), although we cannot rule out the presence of a multimer larger than a tetramer in size in vivo, which is likely unstable during purification or sedimentation analysis. PRMT1 also appears to be present as multimers, including a tetramer, because it migrates between standard molecular masses of 158 and 240 kDa (Fig. 5). In fact, Lin et al. (9Lin W.-J. Gary D.J. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschmann H.R. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) reported that endogenous PRMT1 migrated as a high molecular mass complex of ∼180 kDa on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, although it eluted in a broad peak ranging between 200 and 440 kDa on a Sephacryl S300HR gel filtration column (10Tang J. Gary D.J. Clarke S. Herschmann H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).The specific enzyme activity of GST-PRMT5 from E. coli was several hundredfold lower than that of GST-PRMT5 from mammalian cells (Fig. 3 A), presumably because GST-PRMT5 expressed in mammalian cells is likely to form a homomeric complex with endogenous PRMT5. GST-PRMT5 from E. coli appeared not to form distinct homomeric complexes (data not shown). The C-terminal portion of PRMT5, which contains three important motifs for the PRMT activity, showed by itself neither the enzyme activity nor oligomerization (Figs. 3 and6 A). An interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the PRMT5 protein, which was detected by co-immunoprecipitation, appears to be involved in oligomerization of PRMT5 (Fig. 4). The multimer fractions of FLAG-PRMT5 contained higher specific enzyme activity compared with the dimer fractions, given that the dimer fractions contained much more PRMT5 protein than the multimer fractions as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5). These results suggest that homo-oligomerization of PRMT5 is important for the catalytic activity.The gene for type II PRMT, which produces symmetric dimethylarginine, has not been cloned. PRMT5 methylated MBP, histone, and GST-GAR as a designed methyl acceptor (Figs. 2, 3, and 8). Histones and GST-GAR have been shown to be efficient methyl acceptors for PRMT1, PRMT3, and yeast Rmt1 (argininemethyltransferase-1) (9Lin W.-J. Gary D.J. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschmann H.R. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 10Tang J. Gary D.J. Clarke S. Herschmann H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which represent type I enzymes. Previous studies on the mammalian PRMTs showed that the enzyme responsible for methylating MBP is distinctly different from the histone-methylating enzyme (48Kim S. Lim I.K. Park G.-H. Paik W.K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The MBP-specific methyltransferase preferentially methylates MBP and histone to a much lesser extent. The histone-specific enzyme methylates only histone. We could not determine conclusively whether dimethylarginine detected in the acid lysate of MBP methylated by PRMT5 is symmetric or asymmetric and, consequently, whether PRMT5 is a type I or II enzyme. The HPLC column used for the detection of methylated arginines could not readily resolve symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginines, although dimethylarginine in the acid lysate of MBP methylated by PRMT5 comigrated with a standard symmetric dimethylarginine (Fig.2 C). As PRMT5 methylates MBP and histone, PRMT5 may be an enzyme known as an MBP-specific methyltransferase.Immunoaffinity-purified FLAG-PRMT1 methylated MBP (Fig. 5). However, it was reported that rat PRMT1 and Rmt1, a yeast homolog of human PRMT1, did not methylate MBP in vitro (9Lin W.-J. Gary D.J. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschmann H.R. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 47Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschmann H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Purified FLAG-PRMT1 was not contaminated with PRMT5 since the FLAG-PRMT1 enzyme preparation did not contain PRMT5 as determined by Western blot analysis and FLAG-PRMT1 did not interact with PRMT5 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (data not shown). The discrepancy from the previous results may result from MBP derived from different sources. We used MBP derived from guinea pig brain (Figs. 2, 3, and 5), whereas bovine brain MBP was used as a methyl acceptor in the cases of rat GST-PRMT1 and yeast GST-Rmt1 proteins expressed in E. coli (9Lin W.-J. Gary D.J. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschmann H.R. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 47Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschmann H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, MBP derived from bovine brain was methylated by PRMT5 (JBP1) (23Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These findings make it highly unlikely that MBP from different sources determines whether or not it functions as a methyl acceptor for protein-arginine methyltransferases. On the contrary, in vitro substrate specificity may depend on an enzyme preparation. FLAG-PRMT1 purified from mammalian cells may have different substrate specificity compared with recombinant GST-PRMT1 expressed in E. coli. This may account for the MBP-methylating activity of FLAG-PRMT1.Presumably, the substrate and reaction product specificity of protein-arginine methyltransferases may be partially dependent on the heterogeneity of homo-oligomeric complexes. This is presumed since purified PRMT1 and PRMT5 preparations are composed of dimers and multimers, which can be separated by sucrose gradient sedimentation (Fig. 5). Furthermore, PRMT1 and PRMT5 multimers are likely to be composed of at least three different kinds of multimers formed by noncovalent association of a monomer or a disulfide-linked dimer or by covalent association via disulfide linkage (Fig. 6 B). It is possible that noncovalently associated, large homo-oligomeric complexes of native PRMTs present in vivo might be dissociated into a more stable homo-oligomeric complex during purification by chromatographic methods from cells or tissues. This dissociation would result in different substrate and reaction product specificity. For example, although the spliceosomal D1 protein in HeLa cells is found to be symmetrically dimethylated in vivo, the D1 protein overexpressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells is asymmetrically arginine-methylated. A heptapeptide (GRGRGRG) also present in the D1 protein is asymmetrically methylated by the type II MBP-specific methyltransferase in vitro (8Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, the findings suggest that the tenuous classification of type I and II PRMTs based on substrate and reaction product specificity in vitro should be reconsidered.A heterogeneity of the homo-oligomeric complexes of PRMTs resulting from the association characteristics (Figs. 5 and 6) and the presence of various protein-arginine methyltransferases methylating MBP and histones in cells (1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.-M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R.

In fact, although a number of purifications of protein-arginine methyltransferase have been reported (3Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19024-19033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rawal N. Rajpurohit R. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the polypeptide composition of protein-arginine methyltransferase has been controversial. For example, histone-arginine methyltransferase from calf brain contains two polypeptides of 110 and 75 kDa (36Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19024-19033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Rawal et al. (37Rawal N. Rajpurohit R. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that the enzyme from rat liver contains only a single 110-kDa polypeptide. The purest protein-arginine methyltransferase fraction from HeLa cells contains about eight protein bands upon SDS-PAGE and silver staining, and the two most prominent bands have molecular masses of 45 and 100 kDa (3Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Presumably, the two bands may represent a monomer and disulfide-linked dimer of PRMT1. Our result that the disulfide-linked dimer of PRMT1 is not completely dissociated into a monomer even in the presence of 1 mm DTT (Fig. 6 B, Fraction #33) supports this possibility.PRMT5 has been shown to bind the pICln (I = current,Cl = chloride, and n = nucleotide-sensitive) protein, which is correlated with the appearance of a nucleotide-sensitive chloride current (49Krapivinsky G. Pu W. Wickman K. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10811-10814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pICln protein was shown previously to exist in several discrete complexes with other cytosolic proteins (50Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PRMT5 binds to Janus kinases, which are localized in the cytoplasm and are involved in an interferon-signaling pathway (23Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol.

Fujita T. Itoh M. Hotta H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4954-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation profile of purified PRMT1 and PRMT5 indicates that they are distinctly different enzymes (Fig. 5). Thus, the results suggest that although PRMT1 functions mainly in the nucleus (10Tang J. Gary D.J. Clarke S. Herschmann H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), PRMT5 plays important roles in the cytoplasm.The HCV NS3 protein is a multifunctional protein containing serine protease and RNA helicase activities (28Bartenschlager R.

A specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of PRMT5 and the N-terminal domain of NS3 was detected in vitro and in vivo. 2J. Rho, S. Choi, Y. R. Seong, J. Choi, and D.-S. Im, unpublished data. However, PRMT5 appeared not to affect the enzyme activities of HCV NS3. A reason, then, why PRMT5 interacts with NS3 is that HCV NS3 is post-translationally arginine-methylated by a protein-arginine methyltransferase, and it may possibly modulate the enzyme activity in HCV-infected cells. In fact, we found that HCV NS3 as an RNA-binding protein contains several Arg-Gly motifs and that arginine residues in the NS3 helicase domain are methylated by cellular protein-arginine methyltransferase.2 Therefore, it will be of great interest to determine the functio"

To enhance our understanding of how FTIs inhibit the growth of tumors, we have investigated their effects on cell cycle progression of two human lung cancer cell lines, A-549 and Calu-1. In this report, we show in synchronized A-549 and Calu-1 cells that FTI-2153 treatment resulted in a large accumulation of cells in the mitosis phase of the cell division cycle, with some cells in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, microtubule immunostaining and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DNA staining demonstrated that the FTI-2153-induced accumulation in mitosis is due to the inability of these cells to progress from prophase to metaphase. FTI-2153 inhibited the ability of A-549 and Calu-1 cells to form bipolar spindles and caused formation of monoasteral spindles. Furthermore, FTI-2153 induced a ring-shaped chromosome morphology and inhibited chromosome alignment. Time-lapse videomicroscopy confirmed this result by showing that FTI-2153-treated cells are unable to align their chromosomes at the metaphase plate. FTI-2153 did not affect the localization to the kinetochores of two farnesylated centromeric proteins, CENP-E and CENP-F. Thus, a mechanism by which FTIs inhibit progression through mitosis and tumor growth is by blocking bipolar spindle formation and chromosome alignment.

Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 2Huang C.-C. Fierke C.A. Casey P.J. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 21-36Google Scholar). Protein farnesylation is required for the localization and function of several proteins pivotal to signal transduction pathways (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 2Huang C.-C. Fierke C.A. Casey P.J. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 21-36Google Scholar). Among these is a family of low molecular weight GTPases called Ras (K-, N-, and H-Ras). Ras proteins transduce biological signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus regulating important processes, including the cell division cycle, programmed cell death, and differentiation (3Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 4McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ras proteins are found constitutively activated (due to point mutations) in about 30% of all human cancers, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation and tumor cell survival (5Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar). The interest in farnesyltransferase was heightened when it was discovered that Ras requires farnesylation for its cancer-causing activity. This prompted many researchers to design farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) as potential anticancer drugs (6Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 197-220Google Scholar).Intense research efforts over the last decade using several approaches have resulted in potent and selective FTIs (6Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 197-220Google Scholar). The approaches included rational design of CAAX peptidomimetics, FPP analogs, and FPP/CAAX bisubstrate transition state analogs as well as screening of natural product and chemical libraries. Some of the FTIs were shown to inhibit potently farnesyltransferase in vitro (IC50 in the picomolar range) and in whole cells (nanomolar range), to antagonize oncogenic H-Ras signaling, and to induce apoptosis in Ras-transformed fibroblasts when deprived of either serum or substratum attachment. More recently, FTIs were shown to induce apoptosis of attached human cancer cells in the presence of serum by a mechanism involving, at least in part, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-2 survival pathway (9Jiang K. Coppola D. Crespo N.C. Nicosia S.V. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cheng J.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Finally, FTIs have been shown to be potent inhibitors of tumor growth in several animal models. Their impressive antitumor activity and lack of toxicity to normal cells have led to ongoing human clinical trials with several FTIs (10Patnaik A. Rowinsky E.K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 233-249Google Scholar).Despite these major advances, the mechanism by which FTIs manifest their outstanding antitumor activity remains largely unknown. Although initially FTIs were hypothesized to inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting Ras farnesylation, several key observations suggested that farnesylated proteins other than Ras may be involved. First, the Ras mutation status does not predict sensitivity of human tumors to FTIs in soft agar assays (11Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar). Second, K-Ras, the most prevalent mutated form of Ras in human tumors, becomes geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTIs (12Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar,13Rowell C.A. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14093-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Third, although both FTIs and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors are necessary for inhibition of K-Ras prenylation, FTIs alone are sufficient for inhibition of the growth in nude mice of human tumors with K-Ras mutations (14Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Finally, the kinetics of FTI-induced reversal of transformation do not correlate with that of inhibition of Ras farnesylation (15Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Graham S.L. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One candidate, RhoB, another low molecular weight GTPase that is both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, has been suggested as a target for FTI antitumor activity in fibroblasts (16Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, recent data in human cancer cells of epithelial origin argue against RhoB as a target, because both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated RhoB were shown to antagonize transformation and potently suppress human tumor growth in nude mice (17Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, to date, the critical target for FTIs has not been identified.To further investigate the mechanism of action of FTIs we have studied the effects of FTIs on cell cycle progression of human cancer cells. Our goal is to identify the precise step of the cell cycle where a farnesylated protein or proteins is(are) required. Ultimately, we hope to identify such a protein using this strategy. Previously, we had shown that in NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts protein farnesylation is not required for G1 to S phase transition (18Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in human cancer cells we had shown that FTIs can induce a G1block, accumulate cells in G2/M or have no effect on cell cycle distribution, depending on the cell line (19Vogt A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Here we show by flow cytometry, immunostaining, and time-lapse videomicroscopy, using synchronized human lung cancer cells, that FTIs induce a G1and G2/M block and that the latter occurs through inhibition of bipolar spindle formation and chromosome alignment and causes a significant accumulation of the cells in prometaphase during mitosis.RESULTSFTI-2153 accumulates synchronized human lung cancer cells in G0/G1 and G2/M. To determine the effects of inhibition of protein farnesylation on cell cycle progression, we have used a standard method to synchronize cells (18Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). This was accomplished by blocking cells in G1 by treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin for 48 h and releasing the block by supplying mevalonic acid (MVA), the product of the reaction catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. The human cancer cells were either released in the presence or absence of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-2153 (21Sun J. Blaskovich M.A. Knowles D. Qian Y. Ohkanda J. Bailey R.D. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4919-4926PubMed Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1 A shows that, in the absence of FTI-2153, G1-blocked A-549 cells exited G116–20 h after MVA release, entered and exited S phase between 20 and 32 h, entered and exited G2/M between 24 and 36 h, re-entered a second cycle reaching G1, S, and G2/M peaks at 36, 40, and 44 h. In contrast, A-549 cells released in the presence of FTI-2153 were delayed in their release from the G1 block by about 6 h, entered and exited the first S phase, and then entered G2/M (Fig.1 A). Some cells accumulated in G2/M but some exited and entered G1. Although control cells had 59%, 26%, and 11% in G1, S, and G2/M phases, respectively (96 h after MVA release), FTI-2153-treated cells had 42%, 9%, and 45% (Fig. 1 C). A small proportion (2.5% and 1%) of cells contained 6N and 8N DNA peaks, but FTI-2153 treatment did not affect these proportions (Fig. 1 C). Thus, FTI-2153 induced a delayed exit from G1 and accumulated A-549 cells in both a G1 and G2/M phases of the cell division cycle. Similar results were obtained with another human lung adenocarcinoma, Calu-1 (Fig. 1 B). Here again, FTI-2153 induced a delay in the first cell cycle and resulted in accumulation of cells in G1 and G2/M. Calu-1 cells were able to exit G1, enter and exit S, and enter G2/M. However, a large proportion accumulated in G2/M (Fig.1 B). In contrast to A-549 cells, FTI-2153-treated Calu-1 cells had cells not only with 2N (G0/G1), 3N (S), and 4N (G2/M) DNA content but also accumulated cells with 6N and 8N DNA content (96 h after MVA release) (Fig.1 C). However, control cells had 54%, 28%, 12%, 4%, and 2% in G1, S, G2/M, 6N, and 8N peaks, respectively, FTI-2153-treated cells had 11%, 10%, 31%, 20%, and 28% 96 h after MVA release (Fig. 1 C).FTI-2153 Induces Accumulation of A-549 and Calu-1 Cells in Prometaphase during MitosisThe demonstration that FTI-2153 resulted in accumulation of cells in G2/M suggested that protein farnesylation is critical for either entering G2, exiting G2, entering mitosis, or exiting mitosis. To determine the precise step at which inhibition of protein farnesylation results in disruption of the G2/M transition, we used immunostaining techniques under the synchronization conditions of Fig.1. Synchronized A-549 and Calu-1 cells were grown in the presence or absence of FTI-2153 and stained for tubulin and DAPI at different phases of the cell cycle. FTI-2153 treatment had no detectable effect on the distribution of chromatin and microtubules at interphase when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2). In the absence of FTI-2153 treatment, Fig. 2 (A andB) shows that Calu-1 and A-549 cells traverse all phases of mitosis. In prophase the nuclear membrane is disassembled, DNA is condensed, the spindle poles have begun to separate, and mitotic bipolar spindle assembly has begun. At this point, asters radiating from bipolar centrosomes have formed. In metaphase, the chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, and the mitotic bipolar spindles are fully formed. At anaphase the spindles begin to depolymerize, pulling the chromosomes toward each pole. By telophase the chromosomes have reached their respective poles, and the cell begins to undergo cytokinesis. In contrast, FTI-2153-treated cells accumulated in mitosis with chromosomes organized into a rosette configuration with microtubules radiating from the center (Fig. 2, C andD). The proportion of FTI-2153-treated cells with a mature bipolar spindle and chromosomes aligned at the spindle equator are dramatically reduced (see below).Figure 2FTI-2153 treatment causes accumulation at prometaphase. Calu-1 cells (A, C, andE) and A-549 cells (B, D, andF) were treated as for flow cytometry and immunostained with DAPI and an antibody against α-tubulin to visualize mitotic figure morphology. Representative images of control (Calu-1 (A) and A-549 (B)) and FTI-2153-treated (Calu-1 (C) and A-549 (D)) mitotic figures are shown. Data are representative of two independent experiments.

At least 100 mitotic figures were counted per sample. Fig. 2 F shows that, in the absence of FTI-2153, most A-549 cells in mitosis were in telophase, whereas in FTI-2153-treated cells most cells in mitosis were in prometaphase. For example, 48 h after MVA release, 14%, 26%, 2%, and 58% of control cells and 69%, 16%, 0%, and 15% of the FTI-2153-treated A-549 cells were in prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase/cytokinesis, respectively. Similarly, in Calu-1 cells, 48 h after MVA release, control cells in mitosis had about 5%, 37%, 3%, and 55%, whereas FTI-2153-treated cells had 84%, 8%, 1%, and 7% in prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase/cytokinesis, respectively (Fig. 2 E). Thus, treatment of FTI-2153 resulted in a significant accumulation of both A-549 and Calu-1 cells in prometaphase during mitosis.FTI-2153 Inhibits Chromosome AlignmentThe data described above suggest that a farnesylated protein is critical to a step between prophase and metaphase involving chromosome and/or spindle organization. We first determined the effects of FTI-2153 on organization of chromosomes by three methods, H & E staining, DAPI staining, and time-lapse videomicroscopy.H & E StainingFor H & E staining, cells were treated as described under experiments of Figs. 1 and 2, were harvested at 48 h, fixed with B5 fixative, and stained with H & E to visualize DNA. Fig. 3 A shows that in vehicle-treated Calu-1 cells, chromatin condenses at prophase, aligns at metaphase, begins to separate at anaphase, and reaches the cellular poles at telophase/cytokinesis. In contrast, in FTI-2153 cells, these chromatin figures are rarely seen. Instead, chromosomes in these cells are organized into a ring-like shape (Fig. 3 A). We counted the ring shape mitotic figures in control and treated cells. In Calu-1 cells, out of 53 control prometaphase cells, 30% and out of 56 FTI-2153-treated prometaphase cells, 86% had their chromosomes in a ring-like shape, respectively. Similarly, in A-549 cells (39 control and 59 FTI-2153-treated prometaphase cells) 5% and 68% of control and FTI-2153-treated prometaphase cells had this shape, respectively.Figure 3FTI-2153 treatment induces ring-shaped morphology of chromosomes and inhibits bipolar spindle formation.

Calu-1 cells were treated for 48 h and processed as described for Fig. 1 B except that they were fixed and stained for H & E as described under “Experimental Procedures.” a, b, c, andd represent control Calu-1 cells undergoing prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase/cytokinesis, respectively.e represents an FTI-2153-treated Calu-1 cell with its chromosomes in a ring-shaped morphology. B, DAPI staining. Calu-1 and A-549 cells were treated as in A except that they were DAPI-stained. The number of mitotic figures in prophase/prometaphase and those with their chromosomes arranged in a ring morphology were counted. The data are reported as average ± S.D. of percentages from three independent experiments. The differences between control and FTI-2153-treated cells were statistically different with p values for all samples less than 0.007. C, tubulin staining. Calu-1 and A-549 cells were treated as inA except that they were immunostained with an anti-α-tubulin antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mitotic figures from both control and FTI-2153 cells were counted and reported as average ± S.D. of percentages from three independent experiments. The differences between control and FTI-2153-treated cells were statistically different with pvalues for all samples less than 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DAPI StainingTo further characterize these effects of FTI-2153 on chromatin structure, we stained the DNA with DAPI as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each sample at least 38 and as many as 139 mitotic figures at prometaphase were counted. Fig. 3 B shows that, in control A-549 cells, 79.0% and 21.0% had normal and ring shapes, respectively, whereas FTI-2153-treated A-549 cells had 26.0% and 74.0% normal and ring-shaped chromosomes, respectively. Similar results were obtained with Calu-1 cells where FTI-2153 increased the ring-shaped chromosome morphology from 27.9% to 71.6% (Fig. 3 B).Time-lapse VideomicroscopyThe above studies clearly demonstrate that, in both Calu-1 and A-549 cells, FTI-2153 interferes with a step leading to prometaphase involving chromosome alignment. However, a drawback of these studies is that they only reflect pictures of what happened every 4 h. Yet the whole process of mitosis occurs around 1–2 h for most cells. To follow in a continuous fashion the effects of FTI-2153 on the progression through mitosis, we performed time-lapse videomicroscopy. To this end, A-549 and Calu-1 cells, which had been synchronized and released in the presence or absence of FTI-2153, were recorded. Several cells were observed for up to 70 h after MVA release. Figs. 4and 5 show the cell cycle progression for one cell per sample. In the absence of FTI-2153, Calu-1 cells progressed normally through mitosis (Fig.4 A). For the cell shown (marked with the white star) mitosis started about 35.5 h after MVA release. At this time, the cell rounded and its DNA (black arrow) condensed initiating prophase. The chromosome then lined up along the metaphase plate, separated during anaphase, and migrated toward the two opposing poles (see two black arrows). The cells then pinched off in the middle during telophase/cytokinesis. After completion of mitosis, the resulting two daughter cells (two white stars) flattened out again. The average length of mitosis for the 12 cells (from two independent experiments) analyzed was 56.8 ± 12.6 min. In contrast, FTI-2153-treated cells behaved quite differently. The cell followed (white star) was able to round up 45 h after MVA release (Fig. 4 B). However, progression through mitosis did not occur, but the cells eventually flattened back out. No apparent metaphase, anaphase, or telophase was observed. The chromosomes did not align on the metaphase plate. In the 10 cells (two independent experiments) observed, the cells were able to flatten out again after an average of 286.3 ± 110.4 min. Therefore, FTI-2153-treated Calu-1 cells appear to synthesize DNA, but they are not able to actually divide. These results are consistent with those of Fig.1 B where FTI-2153 accumulated Calu-1 cells in mitosis. Furthermore, because these cells are not able to divide, cells with more than 4N DNA should be more prevalent in FTI-2153-treated cells. We have confirmed this by flow cytometry where 20% and 28% of Calu-1 cells had 6N and 8N DNA, respectively, in FTI-2153-treated samples but only 4% and 2% in control sample (Fig. 1 C).Figure 4FTI-2153 treatment inhibits chromosome alignment of Calu-1 cells as visualized by time-lapse video microscopy. Progression through mitosis of Calu-1 cells treated as for flow cytometry was monitored using time-lapse videomicroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, control;B, FTI-2153.

Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As was the case for Calu-1 cells, A-549 cells that were not treated with FTI-2153 were able to traverse all phases of mitosis. Fig.5 A shows that one of these A-549 cells (white star) rounded up to initiate prophase at 68 h after MVA release, aligned its chromosomes (black arrow) at metaphase, and separated them at anaphase. The cell then pinched off into two daughter cells during telophase/cytokinesis (Fig. 5 A). The two daughter cells then flattened out. The average time it took 18 cells (from two independent experiments) to go through mitosis was 58.7 ± 15.1 min. A-549 cells released in the presence of FTI-2153 did round up but never went through metaphase, anaphase, or telophase (Fig. 5 B). However, out of the 12 cells (from two independent experiments) observed, 11 actually divided and the two daughter cells flattened (Fig. 5 B). The average time for the 11 cells to divide is 83.0 ± 25.6 min.Figure 5FTI-2153 treatment inhibits chromosome alignment of A-549 cells as visualized by time-lapse video microscopy.

CENP-E, a kinetochore-associated microtubule motor that is important for chromosome alignment (20Schaar B.T. Chan G.K. Maddox P. Salmon E.D. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22Liao H. Li G. Yen T.J. Science. 1994; 265: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), contains a potential farnesylation site at its carboxyl terminus. Because the kinetochore-targeting domain of CENP-E is also located at its carboxyl terminus (23Chan G.K. Schaar B.T. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), farnesylation might be important for kinetochore binding. We therefore examined the effect of FTI-2153 treatment on the distribution of CENP-E in Calu-1 and A-549 cells that were in mitosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that CENP-E accumulates at the kinetochores of chromosomes in both control prometaphase cells and drug-treated cells that were arrested in a prometaphase-like state (Fig. 6). Thus, FTI-2153 does not affect the ability of CENP-E to bind to kinetochores. Similar results were obtained for CENP-F (data not shown), another kinetochore protein that has a potential farnesylation site at its carboxyl terminus (24Liao H. Winkfein R.J. Mack G. Rattner J.B. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).Figure 6FTI-2153 does not affect CENP-E localization. Calu-1 and A-549 cells were treated as described under Fig. 1. 48 h after MVA release the cells were immunostained with antibodies against α-tubulin (green) and CENP-E (red) as well as stained with DAPI (blue DNA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next determine whether FTI-2153 affected bipolar spindle formation. We treated A-549 and Calu-1 cells as described for the experiments of Fig. 2, immunostained with an antibody against α-tubulin and counted mono and diaster figures during prometaphase for both vehicle- and FTI-2153-treated cells. For every sample, at least 33 and as many as 75 mitotic figures were counted. Fig. 3 C shows that, in the absence of FTI-2153, 67.1 ± 0.7% (average of three experiments) of the Calu-1 mitotic figures counted had diasters. In contrast, in FTI-2153-treated Calu-1 cells only 2.3 ± 2.7% of the mitotic figures counted had diasters. Similarly, Fig. 3 C shows that, in A-549 cells treated with vehicle, 76.4% and 87.0% (two experiments) whereas, in those treated with FTI-2153, only 18.2% and 18.9% of the mitotic figures at prometaphase had diasters. FTI-2153 treatment increased the percentage of mitotic figures with monoasters from 32.9 ± 0.7% to 97.7 ± 2.7% in Calu-1 cells (Fig.3 C). Similarly, FTI-2153 increased monoaster formation from 13% and 23.6% to 81.8% and 81.1% in A-549 cells. Thus, FTI-2153 inhibited bipolar spindle formation in both A-549 and Calu-1 cells.DISCUSSIONOur previous results demonstrated that FTIs induce a G2/M accumulation in some human cancer cells, but the precise stage of the cell cycle where cells are arrested was not known (19Vogt A.

In this manuscript we present data demonstrating that inhibition of protein farnesylation blocks cells in prometaphase. FTI-2153-treated Calu-1 and A-549 cells were able to enter mitosis as evident from cell rounding, chromosome condensation, and nuclear membrane disassembly. However, these cells were not able to form bipolar spindles and their chromosomes failed to form a metaphase plate. Thus, althoug"

Findings that the 3i loops of the D2 dopamine receptors interact with spinophilin (Smith, F. D., Oxford, G. S., and Milgram, S. L. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 19894–19900) and that spinophilin is enriched beneath the basolateral surface of polarized MDCK cells prompted us to assess whether α2AR subtypes might also interact with spinophilin. [35S]Met-labeled 3i loops of the α2AAR (Val217-Ala377), α2BAR (Lys210-Trp354), and α2CAR (Arg248-Val363) subtypes interacted with glutathione S-transferase-spinophilin fusion proteins. These interactions could be refined to spinophilin amino acid residues 169–255, in a region between spinophilin's F-actin binding and phosphatase 1 regulatory domains. Furthermore, these interactions occur in intact cells in an agonist-regulated fashion, because α2AAR and spinophilin coimmunoprecipitation from cells is enhanced by prior treatment with agonist. These findings suggest that spinophilin may contribute not only to α2AR localization but also to agonist modulation of α2AR signaling.

These receptor subtypes all couple via the Gi/Go family of GTP-binding proteins to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels, potentiation of potassium currents via G protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying potassium channels, activation of phospholipase D, and activation of MAP kinase in native cells (1Kobilka B.

Although all three α2ARs appear to activate similar signaling pathways, differences in the cellular trafficking of these subtypes have been reported, both in naive cells and following agonist activation. Subtype-selective differences in agonist-elicited α2AR redistribution have been noted in several experimental systems (12Von Zastrow M. Daunt D.A. Barsh G. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

The α2BAR subtype is readily internalized following agonist activation, whereas the α2AAR subtype typically is not (14Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Olli-Lahdesmaki T. Kallio J. Scheinin M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9281-9288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α2CAR subtype has not been explored in as much detail with regard to agonist-elicited redistribution because of its considerable accumulation intracellularly (14Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The α2AR subtypes also manifest different trafficking itineraries in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells, even in the absence of agonist treatment. The α2AAR subtype is targeted directly to the basolateral surface (19Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the α2BAR subtype is delivered randomly to both the apical and basolateral surfaces but is selectively retained on the basolateral surface (t12 = 10–12 h) in contrast to its rapid loss from the apical surface (t12 = 5–15 min) (20Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that there is a molecular mechanism responsible for the selective retention of the α2BAR on the basolateral sub-domain of MDCK cells, probably a retention mechanism shared by the basolaterally targeted α2A- and α2CAR subtypes (20Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although α2CARs, like α2AARs, are directly targeted to and retained on the basolateral subdomain, a significant proportion of these receptors is identifiable in an intracellular pool at steady state (14Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Olli-Lahdesmaki T. Kallio J. Scheinin M. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); the functional relevance of this intracellular α2CAR pool has yet to be clarified. Receptor retention on the lateral subdomain of MDCKII cells likely involves the third intracellular loop of the α2AR subtypes. For example, deletion of this loop in the α2AAR subtype (Δ3i α2AAR) results in accelerated basolateral receptor turnover (t12 ≅ 4.5 h) when compared with that for the wild-type receptor or with α2AAR structures that have been mutated in the N terminus or the C-terminal tail (all possessing a t12 of 10–12 h) (21Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the Δ3i α2BAR is not enriched at the basolateral surface of MDCKII cells at steady state (22Saunders C. Limbird L.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 44-52PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our findings that the α2BAR is rapidly removed from the apical surface following random delivery and that removal of the 3i loops of the α2A- and α2βAR subtypes accelerates surface turnover of these receptors, we hypothesize that α2ARs interact, via their 3i loops, with protein(s) enriched beneath the basolateral surface of MDCKII cells to stabilize their steady-state localization. Consequently, we were particularly intrigued by recent findings that the 3i loop of another Gi/Go-coupled G protein-coupled receptor, the D2 dopamine receptor, interacts with spinophilin (23Smith F.D.

Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol.

The present studies were undertaken to identify whether spinophilin interacts with the 3i loops of the α2AR subtypes and, if so, if these interactions are regulated by agents that modify α2AR function. The pGEMEX-2 vector and TnT in vitro translation kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). The [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, at 10 mCi/ml) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). PVDF nylon membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The fast protein liquid chromatography and DEAE-Sephacel columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Dodecyl-β-maltoside and cholesteryl-hemisuccinate were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), respectively. Antibodies against the HA epitope engineered into the α2AR structures was obtained from BABCo (mouse) or from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (rat and mouse). Mouse anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Protein A-agarose was from Vector (Burlingame, CA). Centricon-10 concentrating filters were purchased from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rat antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Horseradish peroxidase substrate for Western detection was Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cy3 and Alexa488 secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). MDCKII cells were plated at confluence (∼1–2.5 × 105 cells) and grown on 12-mm Transwell filters (0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C/5% CO2as described previously (19Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except with daily media changes for 5–7 days. Under these conditions, cells form a monolayer and functionally polarize with distinct apical and basolateral surfaces separated by tight junctions. We routinely verify that tight junctions have formed and that the apical and basolateral compartments are functionally separated from one another using the nontransportable molecule [3H]methoxy-inulin (19Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these leak assays, 2 μCi of [3H]methoxy-inulin is added to the apical subcompartment and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 followed by counting 100 μl of the medium in each of the apical and basolateral subcompartments. Leaks range from 5–10%, and we discard from study any culture wells of >10% leak. Rabbit anti-spinophilin antibodies were generated by injection of purified glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (fused to spinophilin amino acids 286–390) as described previously by MacMillan et al. (26MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified from serum by affinity chromatography. Affinity matrices were generated by mixing 2 ml of Affi-Gel-15 and 1 ml of Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 0.1m HEPES, pH 7.0, in a 10 ml of a Poly Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad). Purified GST-Sp286–390 fusion protein (11.7 mg in 6.5 ml of PBS) was loaded onto the column and incubated with inversion for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 1× PBS until free of unbound GST-Sp286–390, as determined byA280. Unbound sites on the Affi-Gel matrix were blocked by incubation with 1 m ethanolamine for 1 h at 4 °C with inversion. The column was equilibrated with 1× PBS (0.05% NaN3) and stored at 4 °C. A GST “subtraction column” was prepared in the same manner, except GST alone was coupled to the Affi-Gel 10/15 mixed matrix. Serum (2 ml) was added to the GST-Sp286–390 affinity matrix and incubated with rotation for 2 h at room temperature. The column was washed three times with 1× PBS, once with 333 mm NaCl in 1× PBS, and then twice more with 1× PBS. Antibody was eluted twice with 2 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and collected into 200 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, to neutralize the sample. Eluted antibody was pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into 1× PBS using an Amicon Stirred Cell with a YM30 filter (Amicon). To remove antibody directed against the GST portion of the GST-spinophilin fusion protein, concentrated antibody was incubated with the GST subtraction column, prepared as described above, by rotation for 30 min at room temperature. The pass-through from this column was collected and concentrated using an Amicon Stirred Cell as described above, and utilized as the anti-Sp286–390 antibody. Antibody concentration was determined to be 1.44 mg/ml by protein assay (Bradford). Optimal working concentrations of antibody in Western and immunolocalization were derived empirically via Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Polarized MDCKII cells stably expressing the individual α2AR subtypes were grown on Transwells, as described above, and then rinsed once with PBS-CM (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2) and fixed for 15 min with either 100% methanol (MeOH) at −20 °C or with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature (∼22 °C) followed by quenching with two sequential 7.5-min incubations with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS-CM. Spinophilin immunolocalization was best observed after MeOH fixation, whereas the α2AR localization (“signal-to-background” ratio) was best visualized following paraformaldehyde fixation and quenching. For colocalization studies, we used MeOH for fixation of the polarized MDCKII cells. After fixation, cells were rinsed two more times in PBS-CM, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 added to the cell surface of the excised Transwell for 20 min, and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS-CM) for 1 h. Primary antibody was added to the cell side of excised Transwells and incubated for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight (∼15 h) at 4 °C. Mouse 12CA5 anti-HA antibodies were diluted at 1:250 (4 μg/ml), and rabbit anti-spinophilin 286–390 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100 (∼10 μg/ml). MDCKII cells were washed three times for 15 min in PBS-CM at 22 °C before adding secondary antibodies. The secondary antibodies were Alexa488- or Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies, diluted 1:1000 (2 μg/ml) and were incubated with the cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were again rinsed three times for 15 min in PBS-CM and mounted cell-side-up onto a glass slide with Aqua-Polymount and sealed under a glass coverslip. Images were visualized on a Zeiss LSM 410, laser-scanning, confocal microscope in the Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Core Facility. Images were taken through a 40× oil objective at 1.5× magnification. The residues corresponding to the 3i loops of the α2AAR (amino acids 217–377 (27Guyer C.A. Horstman D.A. Wilson A.L. Clark J.D. Cragoe E.J.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17307-17317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the α2BAR (amino acids 210–354 (28Zeng D.W. Harrison J.K. D'Angelo D.D. Barber C.M. Tucker A.L. Lu Z.H. Lynch K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3102-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)), and the α2CAR (amino acids 248–363 (29Lanier S.M. Downing S. Duzic E. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10470-10478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were subcloned into the pGEMEX2 vector in-frame within the polylinker located downstream of the sequence encoding the methionine-rich viral coat protein Gene 10 (30). Alternatively, constructs were generated in which four methionines were inserted via polymerase chain reaction into the N-terminal region of the α2AAR 3i loop ((Met)4-α2A3i) and subcloned into the pGEMEX2 vector. All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. The Gen10–3i loop fusion proteins and (Met)4-3i loops were transcribed, translated, and [35S]Met-labeled using thePromega transcription and translation-coupled (TnT) rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit, as follows: 25 μl of TnT reticulocyte lysate was added to 1 μl of amino acid mix (1 mm, minus methionine), 2 μl of reaction buffer, 1 μl of TnT T7 RNA polymerase, 4 μl of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, at 10 mCi/ml), and 1 μl of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units/μl). Then, 1 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA template was added, and the volume was adjusted to 50 μl with nuclease-free water. The mixture was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Following each synthesis, products were analyzed and quantitated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and autoradiography. The band representing each probe was cut out of the dried gel and counted in scintillation mixture. GST-pull-down assays were performed such that each incubation contained an equivalent amount of [35S]Met-labeled 3i loop as radioligand. GST-spinophilin fusion proteins were generated with spinophilin amino acid regions 151–444 and 169–255 and expressed in DH5α. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. GST or GST fusion protein expression was initiated with the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to proceed for 2–6 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 200 mm NaCl, 100 μm PMSF, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin (TT+ buffer) by one freeze-thaw cycle followed by probe sonication for three 30-s bursts on ice. GSH-agarose (1 ml of a 1:1 slurry equilibrated in TT+ buffer) was added to the supernatant of a 13,000 × g centrifugation and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with inversion. This solution was transferred to a 0.8- × 4-cm Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 12 ml of TT+ buffer, 3 ml of 333 mm NaCl in TT+ buffer, and then with 6 ml of TT+buffer. GST or GST fusion protein was eluted from the GSH-agarose by adding 3 ml of 10 mm free acid GSH in TT+, pH 7.5. Eluted protein was concentrated and exchanged into PBS buffer using an Amicon Stirred Cell. Equimolar concentrations of GST-spinophilin fusion protein were incubated with 300,000 cpm (estimated to represent ∼40 pm) [35S]Met-labeled α2A, α2B, or α2C 3i loop ligand (see above). GSH-agarose (1:1 slurry equilibrated with TT+ buffer) was then added to this incubation, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, and the resin collected by centrifugation. The resin was then exposed to four 1-ml TT+ washes. Interaction with GST-spinophilinversus GST (controls) was determined by elution of the 3i loop into 1× Laemmli buffer (400 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 700 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol) and separation of the eluates by 12% SDS-PAGE. The degree of interaction was quantitated by cutting and counting the bands corresponding to 3i loop (determined via autoradiography) in scintillation mixture. CosM6 cells were plated at 1.75 × 106 cells on 10-cm plates and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C/5% CO2. The following day, cells (at ∼60–80% confluence) were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's specifications, with an empirically optimized ratio of 3 μl FuGENE 6 reagent/1 μg of plasmid DNA. The α2A, α2B, and α2CARs (GenBank™ accession numbers A38316,X74400, and X57659, respectively) were encoded in pCMV4 and tagged at their 5′-end after the start ATG codon with the sequence corresponding to the hemagglutinin tag (HA; YPYDVPDYA), as described previously (19Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Full-length spinophilin (GenBank™ accession AF016252) was expressed in pCMV4, and epitope-tagged with a Myc sequence inserted 5′ after the start ATG codon (Myc; QKLISEEDLLRKR). Medium was changed 24 h after the FuGENE transfection. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were rinsed in serum-free DMEM and incubated with 100 μm epinephrine, or not (control), for 3 min at 37 °C. Regulation of signaling pathways by α2ARs (e.g. inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or stimulation of MAP kinase) typically is maximal following incubation with 100 μm epinephrine for 2–3 min (9Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were then rinsed twice in cold (4 °C) PBS-CM and extracted into lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm PMSF). Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min and solubilized inn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DβM)/cholesteryl hemi-succinate (CHS) extraction buffer (4 mg/ml DβM, 0.8 mg/ml CHS, 20% glycerol, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.6, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm PMSF) by five passes through a 25-gauge needle followed by ten passes in a glass/Teflon homogenizer. The supernatant of a 100,000 × g centrifugation for 1 h at 4 °C was defined as the DβM/CHS-solubilized preparation. A 0.75-ml aliquot of this preparation was “precleared” by a 15-min incubation with 30 μl of protein A-agarose equilibrated with DβM/CHS buffer. HA-tagged α2AAR or Myc-tagged spinophilin was then immunoprecipitated following the addition of rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody or mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, respectively, each at a 1:100 dilution, and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complex was isolated by centrifugation following a 1-h adsorption to protein A-agarose; nonspecifically adsorbed proteins were removed by washing the protein A resin three times in DβM/CHS wash buffer (1 mg/ml DβM, 0.2 mg/ml CHS, 20% glycerol, 25 mmglycylglycine, pH 7.6, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm PMSF) and centrifugation at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted with the addition of 1× Laemmli buffer and heating to 70 °C for 5 min. Eluates were separated via 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (PVDF; Millipore) with a constant current of 1 amp for 72 min in CAPS transfer buffer (1 mcyclohexylamino-1-propane sulfonic acid (CAPS), pH 11, 10% methanol), and subjected to Western blot analysis. PVDF membranes were blocked for 15 min in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% Carnation Instant powdered milk (w/v). The appropriate primary antibody was then added at a dilution of 1:1000 (Rat anti-HA) or 1:2000 (mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody) in blocking buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1.5–2 h. Blots were washed three times for 15 min with TBST and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat or anti-mouse secondary antibodies, as appropriate, at a 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature. Blots were washed again three times for 15 min in TBST, incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 1.5 min, and then exposed to x-ray film for variable times ranging from 5 s to 30 min. Spinophilin is a ubiquitously expressed multidomain protein (25Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) composed of an F-actin binding domain (amino acids 1–153), a PP1 binding/regulatory region (amino acids 427–470 (26MacMillan L.B.

As shown previously, the α2A-adrenergic receptor also is enriched on the lateral sub-domain of these cells (19Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against amino acids 286–390 in spinophilin (26MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1, the affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against spinophilin, visualized here via Alexa488 (green signal)-conjugated secondary antibody, reveals considerable enrichment of endogenous spinophilin at the lateral surface of these polarized cells, corroborating initial reports of Satoh et al. (24Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol.

The overlap of expression of the α2AAR and spinophilin in the lateral domain of MDCKII cells is demonstrated by the considerable amount of yellow signal present in the red/green overlay. Similar results were observed upon colocalization of the α2BAR subtype and spinophilin (data not shown). It should be noted, however, that some spinophilin also is detected intracellularly, including in a sub-apical compartment.Figure 1Laser-scanning confocal microscopy"

A major component of the infectious agent responsible for these diseases is thought to be a post-translationally modified form of a host-encoded membrane glycoprotein PrPC,1 termed PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Conformational differences are observed between PrPC and PrPSc. PrPSc has a large number of β-sheets and a diminished α-helical content compared with PrPC (2Caughey B.W. Dibg A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S.

The protease resistance of PrPSc has been widely accepted as the physico-chemical basis to distinguish between PrPC and PrPSc. A recent study demonstrated that plasminogen has selective affinity to PrPSc but not to PrPC (5Fischer M.B. Roeckl C. Parizek P. Schwarz H.P. Aguzzi A. Nature. 2000; 408: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).It is also ideal to use antibodies distinguishing conformations of PrPC and PrPSc. However, since PrPCis phylogenetically highly conserved and is expressed in various tissues, including immune systems (6Cashman N.R. Loertscher R. Nalbantoglu J. Shaw I. Kascsak R.J. Bolton D.C.

Exceptionally, one of the mAbs (clone 15B3) was reported to be specific for PrPSc (11Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A.

To gain insight into conversion processes, it is important to characterize epitopes reflecting conformational differences between PrPC and PrPSc.PrPC, expressed on the cell surface with a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, is expressed in most tissues of uninfected animals. The function of PrPC has remained obscure. However, it has been suggested that PrPC has a role for normal synaptic function (14Collinge J. Whittington M.A. Sidle K.C. Smith C.J. Palmer M.S.

Furthermore, ablation of the prion protein gene (Prnp) caused cell death in some circumstances in vivo and in vitro (16Sakaguchi S. Katamine S. Nishida N. Moriuchi R. Shigematsu K. Sugimoto T.

Although recent studies suggested that the ectopic expression of thePrnd gene, encoding a homolog of PrPC, was involved in cell death (32Weissmann C. Aguzzi A.

However, the expression level of the mRNA of the Prnp gene is unaltered in cases of scrapie infection (19Oesch B. Westaway D. Wälchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B.H. Aebersold R. Barry R.A. Tempst P. Teplow D.B. Hood LE. Prusiner S.B. Weissmann C. Cell. 1985; 40: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Thus, the equilibrium of PrPC and PrPSc in the pathogenesis remained to be examined.We immunized Prnp −/− mice with native PrPC from wild type mice (Prnp +/+) and established mAbs to PrP. These mAbs specifically recognized PrPC in solution with a marked decrease of PrPC at the terminal stage of illness. Epitope mapping of these mAbs and polyclonal antibodies from mice immunized with native PrPC suggested the importance of octarepeats as part of PrPC specific conformation.DISCUSSIONTo gain insight into epitopes representing PrPCconformation and in vivo conversion processes of PrPC to PrPSc, we immunizedPrnp −/− mice with native PrPC, prepared as brain homogenates or intact thymocytes from wild-type mice. With this attempt, we obtained polyclonal antibody, named Ab.Tg, and seven mAbs. The Ab.Tg was highly reactive to both PrPC and PrPSc (Table II); therefore, it was used as a pan-PrP-specific antibody. Unlike the Ab.Tg, none of the mAbs detected any isoforms of PrP by WB analysis; they showed only weak reactivities to partially purified PrPSc samples in ELISA (Table II). However, all of these mAbs efficiently immunoprecipitated PrP in brain lysates from noninfected mice but not from scrapie-infected mice, indicating preferential affinity to PrPC in solution. We observed that the immunoprecipitable PrPC was markedly decreased in the infected brain by one-fifth to one-sixth of the level in noninfected brain, depending on PrPSc accumulation. At this time point, we did not observe cell loss to this magnitude. Thus, the loss of PrPC probably reflects a reduction of PrPC per cell rather than a loss of cells in diseased brains. Consistent results were also obtained by histoblot analyses. The Ab.Tg detected diffusely distributed PrPC on the histoblot, without any pretreatment (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the same antibody specifically detected PrPSc on the blot exposed to hydrated autoclaving and partial digestion with proteinase K (Fig.5 A). The time course study revealed that the site of the PrPC-decrease correlated with the site at PrPScdepositing (Fig. 5 B). Although the expression level of mRNA of the Prnp gene is unchanged with scrapie infection (19Oesch B. Westaway D. Wälchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B.H. Aebersold R. Barry R.A. Tempst P. Teplow D.B. Hood LE. Prusiner S.B. Weissmann C. Cell. 1985; 40: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the amount of PrPCin infected brains is exhausted by conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, thus providing a molecular basis for the notion that the loss of function of PrPC may partly account for pathogenesis of the central nervous system (14Collinge J.

Invest. 1999; 79: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar).Although all of the mAbs we used showed preferential affinities for PrPC in solution, they were divided into two groups in terms of reactivities to tissue sections. In immunohistochemistry for acetone-fixed scrapie brain, some mAbs (1H8, 4A3, 6B5, and 9A8) recognized a stellar structure (Fig. 6, panel 4), while other mAbs (7H8, 8G6, and 11H1) reacted with plaque structures in neuropil (Fig. 6, panel 7). In mock samples, a weak and diffuse signal was evident. Stellar and plaque structures were never observed (Fig. 6, panels 5 and6). Thus, these stellar and plaque structures might represent disease-specific isoforms of PrP. mAb 4A3 recognized an isoform that accumulates in astrocytes (Fig. 6, panel 4). The PrP may be an intermediate form in converting to the fully pathogenic PrPSc. It has been reported that PrPSc first accumulates in astrocytes prior to development of neuropathological changes (26Diedrich J.F. Bendheim P.E. Kim Y.S. Carp R.I. Haase A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and that the astrocyte-specific induction of PrP in Prnp −/− mice restores susceptibility to scrapie (27Raeber A.J. Race R.E. Brandner S. Priola S.A. Sailer A. Bessen R.A. Mucke L. Manson J. Aguzzi A. Oldstone M.B.A. Weissmann C. Chesebro B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6057-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These data suggest that astrocytes play an important role in scrapie pathogenesis. The mAb 4A3 may be useful to study the roles of astrocytes in scrapie disease. The mAb 11H1 may recognize the isoform closely related to the fully pathogenic PrPSc. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of the mAb 11H1 resembled results obtained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to synthetic peptide or scrapie-associated fibrils in formalin-fixed samples treated with either hydrated autoclaving (21Yokoyama T. Kimura K. Tagawa Y. Yuasa N. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1995; 2: 172-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or guanidine (28Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Either guanidine or hydrated autoclaving pretreatment has been found essential for immunofluorescent detection of PrPSc plaques. The mAbs and Ab.Tg facilitated detecting abnormal isoforms of PrP, with solely acetone fixation. The distinct immunohistochemical staining patterns of two groups of mAbs suggests that conversion from PrPC to PrPSc involves multiple steps at different sites in vivo.The mAbs were preferentially reactive to PrPC in IP but were immunohistochemically reactive to abnormal isoforms of PrP. One of the intriguing observations is that all mAbs recognized multiple discontinuous linear peptides that show no apparent similarities (Fig.7). A similar unusual nature was noted for a PrPSc-specific clone 15B3 (11Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Clone 15B3 recognized three distinct linear polypeptides. At least one of each of the epitopes recognized by three mAbs examined in this study overlapped with one of the 15B3 epitopes. Especially, the segments of 4A3-2 and 11H1-3 completely overlapped with epitopes 15B3-1 and 15B3-2, respectively. Epitope 8G6-2 is closely related to the 15B3-2 epitope. We suggest that these epitopes largely contributed to reactivities of these mAbs to abnormal isoforms in acetone-fixed tissue sections. Epitopes 15B3-1/4A3-2 and 15B3-2/11H1-3/8G6-2 may represent isoforms accumulating in astrocytes and in the neuropil, respectively.Regarding epitopes specific to PrPC, the octarepeat region is notable. Two of three mAbs, 4A3 and 11H1, reacted to the region of octarepeats. Furthermore, results from polyclonal antibody Ab.Tg suggested that this region is likely to be one of the major epitopes on PrPC. Because native PrPC was used as an immunogen, the epitopes recognized by Ab.Tg may reflect conformation of PrPC. A pair of tripeptides ((T/G/S/)WG; positions 55–57, 63–65, 71–73, 79–81, and 87–89) seemed to constitute an epitope of mAb 4A3. Ab.Tg recognized two perfect repeats (GQPHGGGWG; positions 57–65 and 81–89) but not other repeats that carried a substitution (GQPHGGSWG; positions 65–73 and 73–81). The substitutions at 71 and 79 residues (Gly to Ser; underlined) affect the immunoreactivity of Ab.Tg. A model suggested that the octarepeat region is constrained by four Cu(II)-coordinating histidines into a compact structure (29Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The tripeptides involved in 4A3 reactivity are located at centers of loops generated by copper binding (29Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The epitopes for some mAbs generated by DNA-mediated immunization ofPrnp −/− mice were also located at an octarepeat region (8Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the octarepeats are important for antigenicity of PrPC, and copper may contribute to related characteristics. Consistent with this notion, it has been reported that copper can enhance restoration of proteinase K resistance and infectivity after the denaturation of PrPScwith guanidine hydrochloride (30McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25545-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that the polyclonal antibodies from immunized mutant mice revealed limited regions with regard to being effective epitopes, although the Prnp −/− mice were immunologically intolerant of PrP. We examined sera from four independent immune mice and observed reproducible results among the sera against the PrPC immunogen. Epitopes 1 and 2 of Ab.Tg (Ab.Tg-1 and Ab.Tg-2) were always detected, and the third one (Ab.Tg-3) was detected in three of four immune sera, indicating their dominance as epitopes. The NH2-terminal sequences between positions 23 and 40 seldom functioned as an epitope, and therefore were unstable. These results suggested that the amino-terminal half of PrPC has a characteristic conformation, in a good agreement with findings with the mAbs we characterized. We also observed distinct epitope patterns on PrPScfractions. 2T. Yokoyama and S. Itohara, unpublished observation. This experimental strategy may aid in understanding species barrier mechanisms and differences in infectious prion strains replicated in a given animal species.Data from experiments using these mAbs and polyclonal antibodies we developed revealed a marked decrease of PrPC in brains of animals at the terminal stage of illness, thereby providing a molecular basis for the hypothesis that loss of function of PrPC may have some role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Results from epitope mapping and our immunohistochemical studies suggest that conversion of PrPC to PrPSc may involve multiple steps at different sites. Prion diseases, such as scrapie in sheep and goats and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders (spongiform encephalopathy). A major component of the infectious agent responsible for these diseases is thought to be a post-translationally modified form of a host-encoded membrane glycoprotein PrPC,1 termed PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Conformational differences are observed between PrPC and PrPSc. PrPSc has a large number of β-sheets and a diminished α-helical content compared with PrPC (2Caughey B.W. Dibg A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 3Pan K.-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20276-20284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); hence, it is relatively resistant to protease digestion. The protease resistance of PrPSc has been widely accepted as the physico-chemical basis to distinguish between PrPC and PrPSc. A recent study demonstrated that plasminogen has selective affinity to PrPSc but not to PrPC (5Fischer M.B. Roeckl C. Parizek P. Schwarz H.P. Aguzzi A. Nature. 2000; 408: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is also ideal to use antibodies distinguishing conformations of PrPC and PrPSc. However, since PrPCis phylogenetically highly conserved and is expressed in various tissues, including immune systems (6Cashman N.R. Loertscher R. Nalbantoglu J. Shaw I. Kascsak R.J. Bolton D.C.

To overcome this problem, other workers have used mice devoid of PrPC to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to prion protein (PrP) (8Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W.

Brandner S. Priola S.A. Sailer A. Bessen R.A. Mucke L. Manson J. Aguzzi A. Oldstone M.B.A. Weissmann C. Chesebro B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6057-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These data suggest that astrocytes play an important role in scrapie pathogenesis. The mAb 4A3 may be useful to study the roles of astrocytes in scrapie disease. The mAb 11H1 may recognize the isoform closely related to the fully pathogenic PrPSc. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of the mAb 11H1 resembled results obtained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to synthetic peptide or scrapie-associated fibrils in formalin-fixed samples treated with either hydrated autoclaving (21Yokoyama T. Kimura K. Tagawa Y. Yuasa N. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1995; 2: 172-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or guanidine (28Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2117-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Either guanidine or hydrated autoclaving pretreatment has been found essential for immunofluorescent detection of PrPSc plaques. The mAbs and Ab.Tg facilitated detecting abnormal isoforms of PrP, with solely acetone fixation. The distinct immunohistochemical staining patterns of two groups of mAbs suggests that conversion from PrPC to PrPSc involves multiple steps at different sites in vivo.The mAbs were preferentially reactive to PrPC in IP but were immunohistochemically reactive to abnormal isoforms of PrP. One of the intriguing observations is that all mAbs recognized multiple discontinuous linear peptides that show no apparent similarities (Fig.7). A similar unusual nature was noted for a PrPSc-specific clone 15B3 (11Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Clone 15B3 recognized three distinct linear polypeptides. At least one of each of the epitopes recognized by three mAbs examined in this study overlapped with one of the 15B3 epitopes. Especially, the segments of 4A3-2 and 11H1-3 completely overlapped with epitopes 15B3-1 and 15B3-2, respectively. Epitope 8G6-2 is closely related to the 15B3-2 epitope. We suggest that these epitopes largely contributed to reactivities of these mAbs to abnormal isoforms in acetone-fixed tissue sections. Epitopes 15B3-1/4A3-2 and 15B3-2/11H1-3/8G6-2 may represent isoforms accumulating in astrocytes and in the neuropil, respectively.Regarding epitopes specific to PrPC, the octarepeat region is notable. Two of three mAbs, 4A3 and 11H1, reacted to the region of octarepeats. Furthermore, results from polyclonal antibody Ab.Tg suggested that this region is likely to be one of the major epitopes on PrPC. Because native PrPC was used as an immunogen, the epitopes recognized by Ab.Tg may reflect conformation of PrPC. A pair of tripeptides ((T/G/S/)WG; positions 55–57, 63–65, 71–73, 79–81, and 87–89) seemed to constitute an epitope of mAb 4A3. Ab.Tg recognized two perfect repeats (GQPHGGGWG; positions 57–65 and 81–89) but not other repeats that carried a substitution (GQPHGGSWG; positions 65–73 and 73–81). The substitutions at 71 and 79 residues (Gly to Ser; underlined) affect the immunoreactivity of Ab.Tg. A model suggested that the octarepeat region is constrained by four Cu(II)-coordinating histidines into a compact structure (29Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The tripeptides involved in 4A3 reactivity are located at centers of loops generated by copper binding (29Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The epitopes for some mAbs generated by DNA-mediated immunization ofPrnp −/− mice were also located at an octarepeat region (8Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the octarepeats are important for antigenicity of PrPC, and copper may contribute to related characteristics. Consistent with this notion, it has been reported that copper can enhance restoration of proteinase K resistance and infectivity after the denaturation of PrPScwith guanidine hydrochloride (30McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25545-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that the polyclonal antibodies from immunized mutant mice revealed limited regions with regard to being effective epitopes, although the Prnp −/− mice were immunologically intolerant of PrP. We examined sera from four independent immune mice and observed reproducible results among the sera against the PrPC immunogen. Epitopes 1 and 2 of Ab.Tg (Ab.Tg-1 and Ab.Tg-2) were always detected, and the third one (Ab.Tg-3) was detected in three of four immune sera, indicating their dominance as epitopes. The NH2-terminal sequences between positions 23 and 40 seldom functioned as an epitope, and therefore were unstable. These results suggested that the amino-terminal half of PrPC has a characteristic conformation, in a good agreement with findings with the mAbs we characterized. We also observed distinct epitope patterns on PrPScfractions. 2T. Yokoyama and S. Itohara, unpublished observation. This experimental strategy may aid in understanding species barrier mechanisms and differences in infectious prion strains replicated in a given animal species.Data from experiments using these mAbs and polyclonal antibodies we developed revealed a marked decrease of PrPC in brains of animals at the terminal stage of illness, thereby providing a molecular basis for the hypothesis that loss of function of PrPC may have some role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Results from epitope mapping and our immunohistochemical studies suggest that conversion of PrPC to PrPSc may involve multiple steps at different sites. To gain insight into epitopes representing PrPCconformation and in vivo conversion processes of PrPC to PrPSc, we immunizedPrnp −/− mice with native PrPC, prepared as brain homogenates or intact thymocytes from wild-type mice. With this attempt, we obtained polyclonal antibody, named Ab.Tg, and seven mAbs. The Ab.Tg was highly reactive to both PrPC and PrPSc (Table II); therefore, it was used as a pan-PrP-specific antibody. Unlike the Ab.Tg, none of the mAbs detected any isoforms of PrP by WB analysis; they showed only weak reactivities to partially purified PrPSc samples in ELISA (Table II). However, all of these mAbs efficiently immunoprecipitated PrP in brain lysates from noninfected mice but not from scrapie-infected mice, indicating preferential affinity to PrPC in solution. We observed that the immunoprecipitable PrPC was markedly decreased in the infected brain by one-fifth to one-sixth of the level in noninfected brain, depending on PrPSc accumulation. At this time point, we did not observe cell loss to this magnitude. Thus, the loss of PrPC probably reflects a reduction of PrPC per cell rather than a loss of cells in diseased brains. Consistent results were also obtained by histoblot analyses. The Ab.Tg detected diffusely distributed PrPC on the histoblot, without any pretreatment (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the same antibody specifically detected PrPSc on the blot exposed to hydrated autoclaving and partial digestion with proteinase K (Fig.5 A). The time course study revealed that the site of the PrPC-decrease correlated with the site at PrPScdepositing (Fig. 5 B). Although the expression level of mRNA of the Prnp gene is unchanged with scrapie infection (19Oesch B. Westaway D. Wälchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B.H. Aebersold R. Barry R.A. Tempst P. Teplow D.B. Hood LE. Prusiner S.B. Weissmann C. Cell. 1985; 40: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the amount of PrPCin infected brains is exhausted by conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, thus providing a molecular basis for the notion that the loss of function of PrPC may partly account for pathogenesis of the central nervous system (14Collinge J.

Invest. 1999; 79: 689-697PubMed Google Scholar). Although all of the mAbs we used showed preferential affinities for PrPC in solution, they were divided into two groups in terms of reactivities to tissue sections. In immunohistochemistry for acetone-fixed scrapie brain, some mAbs (1H8, 4A3, 6B5, and 9A8) recognized a stellar structure (Fig. 6, panel 4), while other mAbs (7H8, 8G6, and 11H1) reacted with plaque structures in neuropil (Fig. 6, panel 7). In mock samples, a weak and diffuse signal was evident. Stellar and plaque structures were never observed (Fig. 6, panels 5 and6). Thus, these stellar and plaque structures might represent disease-specific isoforms of PrP. mAb 4A3 recognized an isoform that accumulates in astrocytes (Fig. 6, panel 4). The PrP may be an intermediate form in converting to the fully pathogenic PrPSc. It has been reported that PrPSc first accumulates in astrocytes prior to development of neuropathological changes (26Diedrich J.F. Bendheim P.E. Kim Y.S. Carp R.I. Haase A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

(1998) Nature 392, 601–605). This suggests that JNK activation may be involved in GluR6-mediated excitotoxicity. We provide evidence that post-synaptic density protein (PSD-95) links GluR6 to JNK activation by anchoring mixed lineage kinase (MLK) 2 or MLK3, upstream activators of JNKs, to the receptor complex. Association of MLK2 and MLK3 with PSD-95 in HN33 cells and rat brain preparations is dependent upon the SH3 domain of PSD-95, and expression of GluR6 in HN33 cells activated JNKs and induced neuronal apoptosis. Deletion of the PSD-95-binding site of GluR6 reduced both JNK activation and neuronal toxicity. Co-expression of dominant negative MLK2, MLK3, or mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MKK) 4 and MKK7 also significantly attenuated JNK activation and neuronal toxicity mediated by GluR6, and co-expression of PSD-95 with a deficient Src homology 3 domain also inhibited GluR6-induced JNK activation and neuronal toxicity.

Expression of individual GluR5–7 subunits in heterologous systems results in homomeric receptors that respond to glutamate or kainic acid with a rapidly desensitizing current (5Frerking M.

The PDZ domains have been shown to bind to the C terminus of NMDA receptor NR2 and kainate receptor GluR6 subunits, and these interactions are important for the clustering of NMDA or kainate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane (7Kim E.

In transgenic mice lacking PSD-95, although the localization of NMDA receptors at post-synaptic density remains unaltered, the frequency dependence of NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term depression is shifted, and spatial learning is severely impaired (12Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempater M. Webster L. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.M. Morrison J.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G.N.

Suppression of PSD-95 expression inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated activation of nitric-oxide synthase and neuronal excitotoxicity (13Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.-Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), which suggests that PSD-95 is critical in coupling glutamate receptors to cellular signaling networks and plays an important role in their biological function within the central nervous system. JNK is a major stress-activated kinase in mammalian systems that is implicated in mediating neuronal death induced by various detrimental stimuli and by glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity (14Kyriakis J.M.

In the absence of JNK3, a neuronal form of JNK, kainic acid-induced seizure activity and neuronal degeneration are significantly attenuated (1Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S.

Both MLK2 and MLK3 are members of the mixed lineage kinase family typified by a N-terminal SH3 domain, a middle kinase domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region that may bind to SH3 domain-containing proteins. MLK2/3 can directly bind and activate MKK4 and MKK7, which in turn phosphorylate and activate JNKs (17Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol.

The current study was undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanism of GluR6-mediated excitotoxicity. We hypothesized that the SH3 domain of PSD-95 binds to the proline-rich region of MLK2 or MLK3 and recruits these kinases to the proximity of GluR6, leading to JNK activation and neuronal apoptosis. Cell culture conditions for HN33 cells, an immortalized rat hippocampal neuronal cell line, and 293T cells have been described previously (20Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). c-Myc-tagged full-length MLK2 was a generous gift of Dr. A. Hall (University College of London, United Kingdom) and Flag-tagged full-length MLK3 was a gift from Dr. A. Rana (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). HN33 or 293T cells at 50 to 60% confluence were washed once with serum-free medium prior to transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10–20 μg of plasmids with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE/10-cm plate was used in transfection experiments. Antibodies for PSD-95 and GluR6 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., and M2, 9E10, and MLK3 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz. A peptide selected from the MLK2 sequence (amino acids 248–265 DFGLAREWHKTTKMSAAG) was conjugated to KLH for immunization of rabbits, and the resulting polyclonal antibody was purified. The antibody recognizes a 105–110-kDa protein band as expected for MLK2 in the rat brain lysates and the 9E10 immunoprecipitates of 293T cells transfected with c-Myc-tagged MLK2, but is not found in wild-type 293T cell lysates, which lack MLK2. This protein band is no longer detectable when the antibody was pre-absorbed with the peptide antigen (data not shown). Preparation of cell or whole brain lysates and co-immunoprecipitation were conducted as described previously (9Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C.

Precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody as indicated in the figure legends. A Kodak 440 Image Station was used to analyze and quantify blots. Construction and purification of different PSD-95 GST fusion proteins have been described previously (9Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 1–2 μg of GST fusion protein was used forin vitro binding studies. 16 h after transfection, HN33 cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). JNK was assayed as described previously (19Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 24 to 48 h following transfection, cells were fixed and TUNEL staining was performed as previously described (19Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Most apoptotic HN33 cells were detached from the slides and TUNEL staining was performed on the remaining attached cells. TUNEL negative cells (i.e. living cells) were counted in the ×20 power field at four different locations, and 600–800 cells were counted in the control. To test our hypothesis, we first examined whether MLK2 or MLK3 was associated with PSD-95 in 293T cells coexpressing c-Myc-tagged MLK2 or Flag-tagged MLK3. Wild-type 293T cells which lack PSD-95, served as a negative control. 9E10 or M2 antibodies, which detect the c-Myc or Flag epitopes, respectively, were incubated with 293T cell lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by an anti-PSD-95 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, PSD-95 was detected in 9E10 or M2 immunoprecipitates only from 293T cell lysates co-transfected with MLK2/3 and PSD-95 but was not detected from wild-type cell lysates. Next, we examined whether MLK2 or MLK3 is associated with PSD-95 in HN33 cells or in the rat brain. PSD-95 was detected in MLK2/3 immunoprecipitates from HN33 cell lysates or whole rat brain lysates but not in precipitates obtained with preimmune serum or peptide-antigen preabsorbed MLK2 antibody (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, immunoprecipitates of PSD-95 also contained MLK2 (Fig.1 C) or MLK3 (Fig. 1 D). These data indicate that PSD-95 is associated with MLK2/3 in neuronal cells and rat brain tissues. PSD-95 is known to bind to GluR6 (9Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Because MLK2/3 is associated with PSD-95, they may be indirectly associated with GluR6 in the brain. As shown in Fig. 1 E, GluR6 was detected in both MLK2 and MLK3 immunoprecipitates but not precipitates obtained with preimmune serum. We next explored the molecular basis for the association of PSD-95 with MLK2/3. Both MLK2 and MLK3 contain a proline-rich region that may bind to the SH3 domain of PSD-95. PSD-95 GST fusion proteins containing PDZ1 (amino acids 2–151), PDZ2 (amino acids 156–266), PDZ3 (amino acids 302–401), SH3 (amino acids 402–500), GK (amino acids 512–724), or SH3-GK (SGS, amino acids 402–724) domain were constructed and subsequently purified (9Garcia E.P. Metha S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garmer C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These GST fusion proteins were incubated with c-Myc-tagged MLK2 or Flag-tagged MLK3 expressed in 293T cells. We found that MLK2 only bound to PSD-95 SH3 or SH3-GK domain (SGS) GST fusion proteins but not to any of PSD-95 PDZ GST fusion proteins or to GST alone (Fig. 2). We also observed that MLK3 bound only to the SH3 domain but not to PDZ or GK domains of PSD-95 (data not shown). The above data suggest that GluR6, PSD-95, and MLK2/3 may exist in a complex. Because MLK2/3 is a strong activator of JNKs and both JNK and GluR6-deficient mice are resistant to kainic acid-induced seizures and neuronal degeneration (1Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakis P. Flavell R. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 2Mulle C. Seiler A. Perez-Otano I. Dickinson-Anson H. Castillo P.E. Bureau I. Maron C. Gage F.H. Mann J.R. Bettler B. Heinemmann S.F. Nature. 1998; 392: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we reasoned that GluR6-mediated excitotoxicity might be mediated by the MLK-JNK pathway. Thus, we investigated whether expression of GluR6 induces JNK activation in HN33 cells. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were treated with 100 μm kainic acid for 5 min and JNK activity was analyzed by an anti-phospho-JNK antibody. Expression of vector alone (negative control) did not induce JNK activation, whereas expression of GluR6 caused an elevated JNK activity, which was further increased upon stimulation with 100 μm kainic acid (Fig.3 A). To eliminate the possibility that JNK activation was due to activation of other ionotropic glutamate receptors, we employed a series of receptor antagonists. Addition of 10 μm CNQX, a kainate and AMPA receptor antagonist, to the transfection medium significantly attenuated JNK activation while addition of 10 μm GYKI 52466, a selective AMPA receptor antagonist, had no effect. Addition of (−)-AP-5, a selective NMDA receptor antagonist caused a weaker inhibition of GluR6-mediated JNK activation. Coaddition of 10 μm (−)-AP-5 and CNQX to the medium nearly completely blocked JNK activation (Fig. 3 A). These data suggest that activation of GluR6 largely accounts for elevated JNK activity in HN33 cells. Because MLK2/3 is a strong activator of JNK (17Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), we next examined whether either of these two kinases are involved in GluR6-mediated JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 3 B, coexpression of dominant negative MLK2 or MLK3 or MKK4 and MKK7 significantly inhibited GluR6-induced JNK activation in HN33 cells. Dominant negative MLK3 appeared to be less effective. This may be due to its lower abundance in HN33 cells. These data suggest that GluR6 may activate MLK2/3-mediated cellular signaling cascades in HN33 cells. We believe that GluR6 anchors and activates MLK2/3 via a complex involving PSD-95. If this hypothesis is correct, then either deletion of the PSD-95-binding site of GluR6 or mutation of the SH3 domain of PSD-95 should disrupt assembly of the GluR6·PSD-95·MLK2/3 complex and block JNK activation mediated by the receptor. As shown in Fig.3 A, deletion of the C-terminal four amino acids of GluR6 (GluR6Δ) nearly completely blocked JNK activation mediated by the receptor. Co-expression of PSD-95 with a mutated SH3 domain (W470A) also significantly inhibited GluR6-mediated JNK activation (Fig.3 B). Next, we investigated whether expression of GluR6 induces apoptotic cell death in HN33 cells. Expression of GluR6 induced rapid apoptosis, and TUNEL-positive cells were detectable 24 h following transfection. At 48 h post-transfection, about 30–35% of cells were apoptotic (Fig. 4 A). Addition of a nonspecific caspase inhibitor, zDEVD-frm, to the transfection medium completely blocked neuronal death (Fig.4 A), supporting that cell death is apoptotic. PSD-95 has been implicated in activation of nNOS by NMDA receptors (13Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.-Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). To test the role of nNOS in GluR6-mediated neuronal toxicity in HN33 cells,N ω-propylarginine, a selective nNOS inhibitor, was added to the transfection medium. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the nNOS inhibitor had almost no effect on cell death, suggesting that nNOS does not contribute to GluR6-mediated neuronal toxicity in HN33 cells. Addition of 500 μm kainic acid to the medium 24 h following transfection significantly enhanced neuronal toxicity: the number of apoptotic cells was increased to 60% at 48 h post-transfection, compared with 40% without kainic acid (Fig. 4 B). Addition of 10 μm CNQX significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity: over 80% of cells survived (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with the data from JNK activation, GYKI 52466 had no effect while coaddition of 10 μm(−)-AP5 with CNQX nearly completely blocked neuronal toxicity (Fig.4 B). These data indicate that GluR6 plays a major role in the induction of neuronal toxicity in HN33 cells. Next, we investigated whether activation of MLK2/3-mediated signaling cascades is involved in GluR6-mediated neuronal toxicity in HN33 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 C, expression of a mutated GluR6 that does not bind to PSD-95 did not cause significant cell death, and addition of kainic acid did not enhance the toxicity. Co-expression of dominant negative MLK2 or MKK4 and MKK7 significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by GluR6 (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that MLK2-mediated signaling cascades do play a significant role in the induction of neuronal toxicity. Co-expression of dominant negative MLK3 had a smaller inhibitory effect (data not shown) while co-expression of PSD-95 with a deficient SH3 domain inhibited GluR6-mediated apoptotic cell death, although the extent of the inhibition was much weaker than that mediated by dominant negative MLK2 or MKK4 and MKK7 (Fig.4 D). These data indicate that GluR6 activates MLK2/3-mediated cellular signaling cascades via PSD-95 to mediate apoptosis in HN33 cells. GluR6 activation induces neuronal degeneration in hippocampus (2Mulle C. Seiler A. Perez-Otano I. Dickinson-Anson H. Castillo P.E. Bureau I. Maron C. Gage F.H. Mann J.R. Bettler B. Heinemmann S.F.

Dis. 2000; 7: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and GluR6-deficient mice exhibit a resistance to neuronal degeneration and seizure induced by kainic acid (2Mulle C. Seiler A. Perez-Otano I. Dickinson-Anson H. Castillo P.E. Bureau I. Maron C. Gage F.H. Mann J.R. Bettler B. Heinemmann S.F. Nature. 1998; 392: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A similar phenotype was also observed in JNK3 knockout mice (1Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakis P. Flavell R. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of JNKs may be involved in excitotoxicity mediated by GluR6. Although some reports have shown that stimulation of kainate receptors mediates JNK activation (23Schauwecker P.E. Brain Res. 2000; 884: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is unclear how GluR6 mediates JNK activation and whether inhibition of JNK activation blocks GluR6-mediated neuronal toxicity. In this study, we provide evidence that GluR6 activates JNKs via the PSD-95-MLK2/3-signaling pathway. Expression and activation of GluR6 causes JNK activation and apoptosis in HN33 cells. Co-expression of dominant negative MLK2 or MLK3 significantly inhibits both JNK activation and neuronal toxicity induced by the receptor. Additionally, co-expression of dominant negative MKK4 and MKK7, which are immediate upstream activators of JNKs, also significantly inhibited GluR6-mediated JNK activation and apoptosis. MLK2 or MLK3 is associated with PSD-95 and GluR6 in intact neuronal cells and in rat brain tissues, suggesting that MLK2 or MLK3 may assemble into a signaling complex with PSD-95 and GluR6. Deletion of the PSD-95-binding site of GluR6 significantly abolished the ability of the receptor to induce JNK activation and apoptosis in HN33 cells, suggesting that binding of PSD-95 to the receptor is necessary for neuronal toxicity to occur. The SH3 domain of PSD-95 mediates its binding to MLK2/3; and mutation of the SH3 domain of PSD-95 significantly attenuates both JNK activation and apoptosis mediated by GluR6, suggesting that binding of MLK2/3 to the SH3 domain of PSD-95 is critical for induction of neuronal toxicity. MLK2/3 is a constitutively active kinase (17Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our explanation is that assembly of the GluR6·PSD-95·MLK2/3 complex occurs upon activation of the receptor and promotes exposure of the kinase domain to ATP and activation of the downstream signaling pathway. PSD-95 has been implicated in excitotoxicity and the induction of activation of nNOS by NMDA receptors (13Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.-Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In HN33 cells, nNOS activation does not contribute to GluR6-induced neuronal toxicity because the nNOS inhibitor has no effect on apoptosis induced by the receptor. Some reports suggest that p38 MAPK is involved in the neuronal toxicity mediated by NMDA receptors (24Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18518-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We found that addition of SB 203580, a selective p38 MAPK inhibitor, to the transfection medium had no any effect on GluR6-induced neuronal death. In addition, GluR6 failed to activate MAPK in HN33 cells. These data are consistent with the fact that, at moderate expression levels, MLK2/3 selectively activates the MKK4/7-JNK pathway (17Hirai S.

Kainate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of intra-striatal injection of kainic acid in rats creates HD-like pathology (25Beal M.F. Kowall N.W. Ellison D.W. Mazurek M.F. Swartz K.J. Martin J.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The number of kainate receptors is significantly reduced and high affinity receptors are almost absent in the brains of HD patients and HD-transgenic mice (26Wagster M.V. Hedreeen J.C. Peyser C.E. Folstein S.E. Ross C.A. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 127: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Cha J.H. Frey A.S. Alsdorf S.A. Kerner J.A. Kosinski C.M. Mangiarini L. Penney Jr, J.B. Davies S.W.

Moreover, the TAA repeat polymorphism of the GluR6 gene has been linked to a younger onset of HD (28MacDonald M.E. Vonsattel J.P. Shrinidhi J. Couropmitree N.N. Cupples L.A. Bird E.D. Gusella J.F.

A. 1999; 94: 3872-3876Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we showed that activation of MLK2-mediated signaling cascades may contribute to neuronal death induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. The current study suggests that GluR6 activation and mutated huntingtin may share a similar molecular mechanism to induce neuronal death. This would help to explain the potential role of the receptor in the pathogenesis of HD. In summary, our present study gives new insight into how PSD-95 links a kainate receptor to stress-activated kinase signaling cascades. We thank Drs. R. Deth and S. Grate for helpful suggestions and critical reading of the manuscript. We express our gratitude to Dr. A. Rana for the MLK3 vector and Dr. R. Davis for MKK7 vectors."

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the toxin residue Arg13, which is required to inhibit current flow, interacts intimately with the DII pore residue Glu758. Based on this observation, the estimated dimensions of the channel pore, and the known structure of the toxin, these authors proposed that ¼-CTX docks like an inverted pyramid with Arg13 reaching the deep pore region. The experiments that we describe here were designed to determine the actual ¼-CTX docking orientation around the central axis. Despite the detailed knowledge regarding the three-dimensional structure of ¼-CTX, the molecular configuration of its channel receptor remains uncertain. Unlike K+ channels, which consist of four identical monomeric subunits, the pore-forming subunits of Na+ and Ca2+ channels are single polypeptides composed of four nonidentical homologous domains connected by cytoplasmic linkers (Fig. 1 A). Although various lines of evidence have demonstrated that the four Na+ channel domains are structurally asymmetrical (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys.

Indeed, review articles from different laboratories continue to depict the channels in either clockwise (33Marbán E. Yamagishi T. Tomaselli G.F. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) or counterclockwise (1Catterall W.A. Science. 1988; 242: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) topology, reflecting the paucity of data favoring one model over the other. The negatively charged residues Asp762 and Glu765 located in the DII P-S6 linker (30Li R.A. Ennis I. Velez P. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27551-27558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Asp1241 of the DIII P-loop (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of the rat skeletal muscle (¼1) Na+ channel are important for ¼-CTX binding. These DII and DIII channel residues are exposed to the aqueous phase of the pore and influence single channel conductance (27Chiamvimonvat N. Perez-Garcia M. Ranjan R. Marbán E. Tomaselli G.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Li R.A. Velez P. Chiamvimonvat N. Tomaselli G.F. Marbán E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite the significant roles of these residues in ¼-CTX binding, no site of interaction on the toxin has been reported to date. Identification of the interacting partners, on the toxin, of these DII and DIII channel residues will not only reveal the docking orientation of ¼-CTX when bound but will also help to define the internal domain arrangement (Fig. 1 B). To identify the toxin-channel interaction sites, we synthesized five GIIIA-based toxin derivatives: R1A, K11A, Q14D, K16A, and R19A. These toxin mutants were selected because their side chains protrude from different faces of the toxin molecule (Fig. 2), enabling a rigorous dissection of toxin interactions with the channel residues in domains II and III. We first examined the IC50 for block of wild-type (WT), D762K, E765K, and D1241C mutant channels by both WT and point-mutated toxins and then applied mutant cycle analysis to quantitate the individual interaction (or coupling) energies between these channel and toxin sites. Our results indicate that Asp762 and Glu765 interact with Gln14 and Arg19, and Asp1241interacts with Lys16. These results constrain the toxin binding orientation and reveal that the four Na+ channel domains are arranged in a clockwise configuration (when viewed from the extracellular face). ¼1 sodium channel (34Trimmer J.S.

Na+ channels were heterologously expressed in tsA-201 cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 48–72 h for channel protein expression before electrical recordings. The GIIIA form of ¼-CTX was used in this study. Toxin derivatives were synthesized as previously described (21Becker S. Prusak-Sochazewski E. Zamponi G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Gordon R.D. French R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8229-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Chang N.S. French R.J. Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Dudley Jr., S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, solid phase synthesis was performed on a polystyrene-based Rink amide resin using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry. Synthesized peptides were air-oxidized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Peptide composition was verified by quantitative amino acid analysis and/or mass spectroscopy. One-dimensional proton NMR spectra of the synthesized toxin were compared with those of native CTX to ensure proper folding of the point-mutated toxin. Electrophysiological recordings were performed using the whole-cell patch clamp technique (36Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15148) Google Scholar) with an integrating amplifier (Axopatch 200A; Axon Instruments). Transfected cells were identified by epifluorescence microscopy. Pipette electrodes had a final tip resistances of 1–3 megaohms. Recordings were performed at room temperature in a bath solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Only cells expressing peak Na+ currents between 1 and 5 nA were used to ensure good current resolution while maintaining adequate voltage control. Designated toxin amounts were added to the bath when required. The internal recording solution contained 35 mm NaCl, 105 mm CsF, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Toxin was superfused continuously during the experiment. Flow rate was maintained at ∼5 ml/min (bath volume was 150 ¼l). Wash-out began only after the peak currents had reached a steady-state level. Raw current records were analyzed using custom-written software. Equilibrium half-blocking concentrations (IC50) for ¼-CTX were determined from the following binding isotherm, I/Io=(1)/(1+([toxin]/IC50))Equation 1 where IC50 represents the half-blocking concentration, and IO and I are the peak currents measured from a step depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV before and after application of the toxin, respectively. For mutant cycle analysis, coupling/interaction energies (ΔΔG) for various mutant toxin-channel pairs were calculated from the equilibrium IC50 values using the following equations, ΔΔG=ΔG1−ΔG2Equation 2 ΔG1=GMutated toxin­WT channel−GWT toxin­WT channel=RT(ln IC50Mutated toxin­WT channel−ln IC50WT toxin­WT channel)Equation 3 ΔG2=GMutated toxin­Mutated channel−GWT toxin­Mutated channel=RT(ln IC50Mutated toxin­Mutated channel−ln IC50WT toxin­Mutated channel)Equation 4 where R is the gas constant and T is the Kelvin temperature. The S.E. values for ΔΔG were estimated by dividing the square root of the sum of the variances of the RT ln IC50 means by the square root of the number of degrees of freedom. All data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using a paired Student's t test at the 5% level. We initially looked for molecular interactions between the DII P-S6 channel residues (i.e. Asp762 and Glu765) and ¼-CTX variants using mutant cycle analysis. Prediction of interactions (attractive or repulsive) between channel and toxin residues using this analysis requires determinations of blocking affinity of all of the following combinations: WT channel-WT toxin, mutant channel-WT toxin, WT channel-mutant toxin, and mutant channel-mutant toxin (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 37French R.J. Dudley Jr., S.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 575-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar for review). Therefore, we first determined the half-blocking concentrations (IC50values) for block of WT ¼1 Na+ channels by both WT ¼-CTX and the mutant toxin derivatives R1A, Q14D, and R19A. Fig.3 A shows representative whole-cell sodium currents recorded from cells expressing WT channels in the absence and presence of the toxin variants. The corresponding dose-response curves for binding of these toxins are shown in Fig.3 B. Consistent with previous results (11Sato K. Ishida Y. Wakamatsu K. Kato R. Honda H. Ohizumi Y. Nakamura H.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8229-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the toxin derivatives R1A, Q14D, and R19A displayed significantly reduced affinity for block of WT Na+ channels compared with WT ¼-CTX. Using the same strategy, we then determined the IC50 for block of the DII P-S6 mutants D762K and E765K by the same toxins. The IC50 values for these toxin-channel pairs are summarized in Fig. 4. Whereas both D762K and E765K channels were blocked by WT or R1A toxins with reduced potency, their block by Q14D and R19A was augmented compared with WT channels (Fig. 4). From the measured IC50 values, we estimated coupling or interaction energies (ΔΔG) between these toxin and channel sites (Fig.5). In general, the patterns of interactions for D762K and E765K were similar. Both DII-PS6 residues had the strongest interactions with Q14D (D762K/Q14D = 1.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol; E765K/Q14D = 1.3 ± 0.1 kcal/mol), followed by R19A (D762K/R19A = 0.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mol; E765K/R19A = 1.0 ± 0.1 kcal/mol); in contrast, using the conventional cut-off of 0.5 kcal/mol for significance (38Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), there was no clear interaction with R1A (D762K/R1A = 0.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol; E765K/R1A = 0.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol). These results might be explained if Asp762 and Glu765 are close to Gln14, farther from Arg19, and distant from Arg1 in the toxin-bound state.Figure 4A, representative sodium currents from D762K and E765K channels recorded in the absence and presence of WT, R1A, Q14D, or R19A ¼-CTX as indicated. Control peak amplitudes for D762K channels were 2.6, 2.6, 4.1, and 3.6 nA for block by WT CTX, R1A, Q14D, and R19A, respectively. For E765K channels, they were 2.9, 3.1, 5.0, and 1.9 nA, respectively.

Interactions of D762K and E765K were stronger with Q14D than with R19A, suggesting that these channel residues are more closely associated with Gln14 than with Arg19 when the toxin molecule is bound to the channel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We and others have shown that neutralization of the charge on the DIII P-loop residue Asp1241significantly destabilizes ¼-CTX binding (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Chang N.S. French R.J. Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Dudley Jr., S.

However, the role of this residue in ¼-CTX's interactions with the Na+ channel is undefined. Since ¼-CTX carries a net positive charge and Asp1241 is negatively charged and exposed to the aqueous pore (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Chiamvimonvat N. Perez-Garcia M. Ranjan R. Marbán E. Tomaselli G.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the toxin and this channel residue may interact electrostatically. To define the toxin interaction with this residue, we introduced the point mutations D1241C for charge neutralization, D1241K for charge reversal, and D1241E for charge conservation; the effects on ¼-CTX block are summarized in Fig.6. Consistent with previous results (9Li R.A. Tsushima R.G. Backx P.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1874-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), D1241C (IC50 = 3.3 ± 1.5 ¼m,n = 3) exhibited reduced block by ¼-CTX compared with WT channels. As expected for an electrostatic effect, the charge-reversed mutation D1241K (IC50 = 9.4 ± 3.4 ¼m, n = 3) further destabilized toxin affinity compared with the charge-neutralized cysteine mutant. In contrast, the charge-conserving mutation D1241E partially preserved sensitivity to ¼-CTX (IC50 = 110.0 ± 20.1 nm, n = 4); D1241E channels were only ∼3-fold less sensitive than WT channels. Taken together, these results support the notion that electrostatic interactions exist between Asp1241 and ¼-CTX. To further constrain the binding orientation, we studied the interactions of DIII-D1241 with ¼-CTX, looking for couplings between this channel residue and Arg1, Lys11, and Lys16of the toxin. These toxin sites were chosen because their side chains protrude from different faces of ¼-CTX compared with Gln14 and Arg19 (see Fig. 2 for locations of these residues). Fig. 7 A shows the IC50 values for block of D1241C channels by the ¼-CTX derivatives R1A, K11A, and K16A. Interestingly, the potency of block by K16A was significantly greater in D1241C channels than in WT channels, consistent with a stronger interaction between the D1241C mutant channel and K16A than between WT channels and K16A. This change in interaction energy could reflect a gain of attractive and/or a relief of repulsive forces, leading to increased potency of the K16A derivative. In contrast, the potencies of block by either R1A or K11A were reduced when applied to D1241C channels, in a similar manner to that seen with the WT channels, indicating an additive effect of these channel and toxin mutations. Fig. 7 B shows the coupling energies for D1241C with R1A, K11A, and K16A. D1241C displays an exceptionally strong positive interaction with Lys16(3.2 ± 0.2 kcal/mol), implying a close association between these toxin and channel sites in the toxin-channel complex. Less significant interactions were identified with Arg1 (0.5 ± 0.2 kcal/mol) and with Lys11 (0.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol). Consistent with previous studies, our experiments with alanine-substituted ¼-CTX GIIIA derivatives on WT ¼1 channels show significant reductions in toxin-binding affinity, suggesting that the positively charged toxin residues Arg1, Lys11, Lys16, and Arg19 are critical for its biological activity. These results were qualitatively similar to previous studies using either glutamine or alanine substitution for charge neutralization at these toxin positions, when assessed using a rat diaphragm bioassay or bilayer-incorporated single Na+ channels, respectively (11Sato K.

Prusak-Sochazewski E. Zamponi G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Gordon R.D. French R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8229-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reduction in blocking affinity reported in these earlier studies, and in our own data, was in the order Arg19 > Lys16 > Arg1 ∼ Lys11. Since the side chains of these toxin residues are spread over a wide surface and protrude in different directions around the toxin molecule, these results are most consistent with the notion that the ¼-CTX binding site, unlike the ones for tetrodotroxin and saxitoxin, covers a more extensive area of the channel surface. Additionally, the highly site-specific pattern of interactions among the various toxin and channel sites further implies that intimate toxin-channel interactions are localized and argue against global disruptions of either the channel or the toxin by the mutations introduced. Charge manipulations at position 1241 in DIII by point mutations support an electrostatic role for this residue in ¼-CTX binding, since the charge reversal mutation (D1241K) further destabilized toxin block compared with the charge-neutralized mutant (D1241C), whereas conservation of charge (D1241E) partially restored wild-type toxin affinity. This incomplete restoration by the glutamate substitution suggests that an aspartate is required at position 1241 to confer wild-type ¼-CTX blocking behavior. This observation could be attributed to steric hindrance, since the glutamate side chain is one methyl group longer than that of aspartate. Overall, the data suggest that the charges, as well as their precise location within the pore, are critical for toxin-channel interaction. Inspection of the three-dimensional structures of GIIIA ¼-CTX reveals that Arg13, Gln14 (or Arg14 for ¼-CTX GIIIB, whose three-dimensional structure is essentially the same as GIIIA) (14Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8824-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Lys16, Hyp17, and Arg19 are clustered on one helical face of the toxin molecule (Fig. 2, bottom panel) (11Sato K. Ishida Y. Wakamatsu K. Kato R. Honda H. Ohizumi Y. Nakamura H. Ohya M. Lancelin J.M. Kohda D. Inagaki F. J. Biol.

We and others have demonstrated that Arg13, Lys16, Hyp17, and Arg19 are essential residues for the biological activity of the toxin (see Refs. 11Sato K. Ishida Y. Wakamatsu K. Kato R. Honda H.

Channels. 1995; 3: 164-174Google Scholar, and this report). Here we further show that Gln14 and Arg19 of the toxin interact strongly with the DII P-S6 channel residues Asp762 and Glu765. Previously, Chang et al. (32Chang N.S. French R.J. Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Dudley Jr., S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) showed that Arg13 associates closely with the DII P-loop residue Glu758. However, even with the assumption that Arg13 is directed inward, approximately parallel to the conducting axis of the pore, these findings still do not completely define the docking orientation of ¼-CTX with respect to all channel domains, because the data are limited to toxin-domain II interactions. We therefore studied also the interactions of DIII-D1241 with the toxin. Our results indicate that Asp1241 interacts strongly with Lys16 but not Arg1 and Lys11 (Fig. 7). Taken together, these findings highly suggest that the toxin Arg13-Gln14-Lys16-Hyp17-Arg19helical face interacts with the channel receptor site (13Wakamatsu K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Lancelin J.M. Ishida Y. Oya M. Nakamura H. Inagaki F. Sato K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12577-12584Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8824-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fig.8 shows a schematic representation of a possible docking orientation of ¼-CTX based on the pattern of specific toxin-channel interactions observed. According to this model, the Arg13-Gln14-Lys16-Hyp17-Arg19helical face associates closely with the P-segment (including the P-S6 linker) of domain II. Arg13 projects into the pore and is closest to Glu758. Asp762 and Glu765 both closely interact with Gln14 as well as Arg13 but are capable of interacting also with Arg19. The proposed docking orientation of ¼-CTX predicts that Arg1 faces the opposite direction and is remote from DII, consistent with our experimental observations (cf. Fig.5). In addition, our model also predicts that Lys11protrudes in a direction away from the DII P-loop and therefore, like R1, also should not interact strongly with any of the DII residues. The strong coupling between the toxin residue Lys16 and the channel residue Asp1241 in DIII (Fig. 7) place these toxin and channel residues in close proximity with each other in the toxin-bound state. According to the toxin orientation proposed above, Lys16lies above Arg13, implying that Asp1241 is located shallower within the pore than Glu758. This is consistent with fractional electrical distances estimated from single channel recordings (27Chiamvimonvat N. Perez-Garcia M. Ranjan R. Marbán E. Tomaselli G.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This arrangement of the toxin molecule, channel domains, and residues also explains the somewhat marginal interaction of Asp1241 with Lys11, since this toxin residue may not directly face Asp1241 (or DIII). Based on the known structure of ¼-CTX and the proposed toxin docking orientation, our results suggest a clockwise arrangement of the channel domains when viewed from the external surface (Fig. 8). This conclusion is consistent with that proposed recently by Dudley et al.(39Dudley Jr., S.C. Chang N. Hall J. Lipkind G. Fozzard H. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although in general their conclusion was based on entirely different lines of evidence and interpretation. The models of toxin-channel docking in the two studies differ in several important details. In contrast to our model, Dudley et al. place Lys16 between DI and DIV. They detected little binding energy between Lys16 and Met1240 in DIII using the mutant pair K16A and M1240A and propose that Arg1 is adjacent to DII using R1A and T759I. Their arguments were based on analysis of possible interactions with all four domains, which, in general, were energetically weaker than the key interactions reported here. In summary, we have demonstrated that the toxin residues Gln14 and Arg19 interact with the DII P-S6 channel residues Asp762 and Glu765 and that Lys16 interacts strongly with DIII-D1241. These data suggest a unique docking orientation of ¼-CTX. Based on these results and the known three-dimensional structure of ¼-CTX, we further conclude that the four Na+ channel domains are arranged in a clockwise configuration when viewed from the extracellular side."

Epidemiological surveys report that the seroprevalence for HHV8 ranges from 0 to 20% in the general population of the Western world (12Cathomas G. Virchows Arch. 2000; 436: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, HHV8 seropositivity was observed to be increased in populations exposed to sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), suggesting that HHV8 is also a sexually transmitted pathogen (13Martin J.M. Ganem D.E. Osmaond D.H. Page-Shafer K.A. Macrae D. Kedes D.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). As the etiologic agent for KS, HHV8 generally results in latent infection in its natural host cells (14Sarid R. Olsen S.J. Moore P.S. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 139-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on several extensive studies on the association of HIV and the development of KS, it is now understood that HHV8 is required but not necessarily sufficient for the development of KS (15Iscovich J. Biffetta P. Franceschi S. Azizi E. Sarid R. Cancer. 2000; 88: 500-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In fact, the incidence rate of KS among HIV-1-infected individuals is up to 100,000-fold higher than that among the general population, and 300-fold higher than that for persons with other types of acquired immunosuppression. These findings suggest that immunosuppression likely plays a role as a cofactor with HHV8 in the development of KS; however, they also suggest that HIV-1 infection, independent of its immunosuppressive effects, contributes to HHV8-induced KS (16Beral V. Peteman T.A. Berkelman R.L. Jaffe H.W. Lancet. 1990; 335: 123-127Abstract PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been proposed by several investigators (17Nakamura S.

Chemother. 1994; 46: 62-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the role of HIV-1 in KS potentially involves two additional events: HIV-1-induced cytokines production and production of HIV-1 Tat protein. Indeed, cytokines produced by HIV-1-infected cells can induce lytic cycle replication of HHV8, and Tat can activate the vascular epithelial growth factor receptor KDR in endothelial cells (20Morini M. Benelli R. Giunciuglio O. Carlone S. Anrena G. Noonan D.M. Albini A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Currently, it cannot be excluded that there may be many yet characterized interactions between HHV8 and HIV-1 that explain the dramatically higher incidence of KS in coinfected individuals. Thus, additional HIV proteins and/or cellular factors induced by HIV-1 could contribute to KS pathogenesis with possibly complex reciprocal effects between HHV8 and HIV-1. Consistent with these thoughts, many herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (21Romano G. Guan M. Long W.K. Henderson E.E.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 2004-2008PubMed Google Scholar) have been described to influence HIV-1 replication and expression. To decipher mechanistic interplays between HHV8 and HIV-1, several relevant findings need to be considered. Typically, HHV8 is found in B lymphocytes, keratinocytes, epithelial cells, KS tumor cells, and endothelial cells (31Blauvelt A. Adv. Dermatol. 1999; 14: 167-206PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the predominant host cells for HIV-1 are CD4+ T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and mononuclear phagocytes (32Martin J.C. Bandres J.C. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1999; 22: 413-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weiss R.A. Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2000; 5: A10-A15Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Moir and colleagues (34Moir S. Lapointe Malaspina A. Ostrowski M. Cole C.E. Chun T.-W. Adelsberger J. Baseler M. Hwu P. Fauci A.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7972-7980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown recently that the up-regulation of CD4 and CXCR4 on B lymphocytes mediated by CD40 stimulation leads to increased susceptibility of these B lymphocytes to T-tropic HIV-1 infection. Conversely, dendritic cells and macrophages have been found to be susceptible cells for HHV8 infection (35Froeman K.E. Kash J.J. Eilers D.B. Nickoloff B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 603Google Scholar, 36Moses S.V. Fish K. Ruhl R. Smith P. Chandran B. Nelson J.A. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1999; 21: A28Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, HHV8-infected B lymphocytes are further infectable by HIV-1 through a cell-cell-mediated pathway (37Varthakavi V. Browning P.J. Spearman P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10329-10338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it stands to reason that in vivo HHV8 and HIV-1 genomes could coexist in some cells in dually infected individuals. With the goal of elucidating better intracellular interactions between HHV8 and HIV-1, we queried for potential reciprocal effects on gene expression between HHV8 and HIV-1. We found that when the HHV8-positive primary effusion lymphoma cell line BCBL-1 (38Renne R. Zhong W. Herndier B. Kedes D. McGrath M. Ganem D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar) was fused to HIV-1-latent ACH2 cells (39Clouse K.A. Powell D. Washington I. Poli G. Strebel K. Farrar W. Barstad P. Kovacs J.

A. 1989; 86: 2365-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), enhanced expression was observed from both HHV8 and HIV-1 genomes. Further analyses indicated that sole expression of the HHV8 KIE2 (41Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) protein was sufficient to activate the HIV-1 LTR. On the other hand, expression of either HIV Vpr (42Conti L Varano B. Gauzzi M.C. Matarrese P. Federico M. Malorni W. Belardelli F. Gessani S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or Tat (43Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) was sufficient to modulate HHV8 expression. Our data suggest that reciprocal transcriptional activation between HHV8 and HIV-1 may explain in part the immunosuppression-independent contribution of HIV-1 to HHV8-induced KS. BCBL-1 and ACH2 were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research Reagent and Reference Program. Jurkat cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. BCBL-1, ACH2, and Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For induction of HIV expression in ACH2 cells, 50 ng/ml TPA and 2 μg/ml PHA were added into complete medium (44Pomerantz R. Trono D. Feinberg M.B. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 61: 1271-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). BCBL-1 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TPA for 3 days to stimulate HHV8 expression (2Noore P.S. Gao S.J. Dominguez G. Gesarman E. Lungu O. Knowles D.M. Garber R. Pellett P.E. McGeoch E.J. Chang Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV latent ACH2 cells were mixed with BCBL-1 in equal number. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended into 1 ml of 100% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 in RPMI 1640 containing 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The cell/polyethylene glycol suspension was centrifuged at 100 ×g for 2 min, thereafter, 10 ml of RPMI 1640 were added to resuspend the cell pellet. Cells were then centrifuged at 100 ×g for 5 min, supernatant was removed, and cells were finally resuspended into complete medium (46Jeang K.T. Shank P.R. Rabson A.B. Kumar A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3874-3878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated form fused cells with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (50 μg) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe (3 × 105cpm). Hybridized reactions were digested with RNase A and RNase T1, and the nuclease-protected RNA probe was analyzed on a 5% denaturing acrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. HIV-1 antisense TAR probe was constructed as described previously (47Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldasarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Antisense probe to the HHV8 IL-6 sequence (GenBank™ accession no.U93872) from nucleotide 17242 to 17279 corresponding to thevIL-6 coding region was transcribed from the Sp6 promoter in the pGEM IL-6 plasmid, which contains a cloned IL-6 sequence. Antisense actin probe was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase from vector pTRI-β-actin-human (Ambion, Austin, TX). Protected actin transcript corresponds to a band of 245 bp. The luciferase cDNA under the control of the HIV-LTR (pLTR) was constructed in the pGL2 basic vector. HIV-LTR mutant reporters were as follow: pLSM1 with −111/−94 deletion, pLSM2 with −93/−79 deletion, pLSM3 with −105/−81 deletion, pLSM4 with −75/−58 deletion, and pLSM5 lacking of −57/−40 nucleotides. These luciferase reporter plasmids were from the NIAID AIDS Reagent Repository. The promoter activities of wild-type and mutant HIV LTR were assayed by transiently transfecting BCBL-1 and HeLa cells, which were either mock-treated or treated with TPA for 48 h prior to the transfection. To analyze the transcriptional effects of HHV8 immediate-early genes on HIV LTR, Jurkat cells were transfected with KIE expression vectors and cognate reporter constructs. Amounts of transfected DNA were equalized using pCMV Tag2B. Each transfection also included a cotransfected pCMV β-galactosidase plasmid whose activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. 5 × 105 Jurkat cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 24-well plate. All transfection reactions were performed in triplicate; values were calculated for standard deviations. Alternatively, BCBL-1 cells (1 × 107) were placed in 0.5 ml of electroporation buffer (RPMI 1640 containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids) (48Graves J.D.

Cells were then electroporated at 250 V and 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). After pulse application, cells were immediately pelleted by centrifugation and then kept for 20 min at room temperature (49Li L.H. Ross R. Hui S.W. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The efficiency of transfection was measured by transfecting BCBL-1 with plasmid pEGFP-C (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), which contains the enhanced green fluorescence protein gene fused to the CMV immediate-early gene promoter. After 24 h, 40% of the electroporated cells routinely displayed green fluorescence. BCBL-1 cells, which had been chemically induced into lytic cycles, were harvested after exposure to 3 mm sodium butyrate for 4 h. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with a QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and was reverse-transcribed using a Fast-Run RT-PCR kit (Protech, Taiwan). The cDNA sequences of HHV8 immediate-early genes KIE2,KIE3, and KIE1 type I (41Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were based on GenBank™ accession nos. AF091346, AF091347, and AF091348, respectively. The KIE1 gene of HHV8 transcribes three splicing variants ranging from 3.6 to 3.8 kb in length. These species encode three putative open reading frames ORF50, ORFk8.2, and ORFk8α. cDNAs for ORF50, ORFk8.2, and ORFk8α were also cloned separately into expression vectors. The following oligonucleotide primers were used in RT-PCRs: 5′-end of KIE2, 5′-GCGCAAGCTT ATGGCGATGTTTGTG-3′; 3′-end ofKIE2, 5′-GCATCTCGAG TTATCAGTCCAGCCA-3′; 5′-end ofKIE3, 5′-CGCCGATATC ATGCAAATTAGCTTT-3′; 3′-end ofKIE3, 5′-ATATCTCGAG TTATTGAAGCCCAGG-3′; 5′-end ofKIE1–50, 5′-GGGTGATATC ATGGCGCAAGATGAC-3′; 3′-end ofKIE1–50, 5′-GGTACTCGAG TCAGTCTCGGAAGTA-3′; 5′-end ofKIE1–8.2, 5′-GCCGGATATC ATGTTGAAGCTTGGT-3′; 3′-end ofKIE1–8.2, 5′-GGATCTCGAG CTATGTAGGGTTTCT-3′; 5′-end ofKIE1–8α, 5′-CCGCGATATC ATGCCCAGAATGAAG-3′; 3′end ofKIE1–8α, 5′-GCAACTCGAG TCAACATGGTGGGAG. Recognition sites for restriction enzymes are underlined; boldfacenucleotides denote the start (5′-end oligonucleotides) and stop codons (3′-end oligonucleotides). PCR conditions for KIE2and KIE1–8α cDNA amplification were 35 cycles at 94 °C, 1 min; 53 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min and that forKIE3, KIE1–50, and KIE1–8.2 were 35 cycles at 94 °C, 1 min; 50 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1.5 min. The PCR-generated fragments of the HHV8 KIE cDNAs were subcloned into pCMV Tag2B (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield flag-tagged pKIE2, pKIE3, pKIE1–50, pKIE1–8.2, and pKIE1–8α. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection and were resuspended into lysis buffer (0.5m HEPES, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8). After three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing, cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and were analyzed for luciferase activity using a Luciferase assay system (Packard, Meriden, CT). β-Galactosidase assays were performed by incubating cell extracts with an equal volume of β-galactosidase assay buffer (Packard). Readout values of luciferase activity were normalized against corresponding β-galactosidase value for each sample within each experiment. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). To ensure that no DNA contaminated the isolated RNA, the RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) prior to reverse transcription. The mixtures containing random hexamers for cDNA syntheses were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 42 °C for 1 h. By heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was denatured. As an additional control, each sample was also subjected to reverse transcription in the absence of RT. Two microliters of the cDNA products were then added to 48 μl of PCR reaction mixture, which contained HHV8 major capsid protein primers (forward: 5′-GTACACCTATTTCTTCCCTGTTGG-3′; reverse: 5′-TGCTCATACCTGAGACCGTACC-3′) and internal control 18 S rRNA primers/competitors (Ambion, Austin, TX) at a 2:8 ratio. The 18 S rRNA competitors were modified at their 3′-ends to block extension by DNA polymerase. Amplification was carried out according the following protocol: preheating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s in each segment. The PCR products of major capsid protein (270 bp) and 18 S rRNA (314 bp) were analyzed on a 2.5% agarose gel. To obtain meaningful results, the linear range of relative quantitative RT-PCR was determined by graphing cycles versus products, which were quantitated with an Alpha Innotech Corp. IS-1000 digital imaging system. The amplification was found to be in a linear range of 20 to 29 thermal cycles. To better understand functional interactions between HHV8 and HIV-1, a series of cell fusion experiments was done. We took advantage of the fact that ACH2 and BCBL cells are latently infected with HIV-1 and HHV8, respectively. Both genomes can be activated from latency by treatment of cells with phorbol ester, TPA. By fusing together ACH2 and BCBL cells, heterokaryons can be created, which simultaneously contain both viral genomes. In this manner, potential interactions between the two viruses in the same cell could be assayed. When ACH2 cells were fused with TPA-induced BCBL-1 cells, RNase protection assay showed that HIV-1 TAR-containing RNAs were markedly increased when compared with control samples (Fig.1 A). Because all HIV-1 transcripts contain TAR sequence, this finding suggests that some element associated with the HHV8 genome could activate transcription from the HIV-1 LTR. Indeed, the BCBL-1-mediated transcriptional enhancement was considerably stronger than that achieved by chemically inducing ACH2 cells with TPA and PHA. Thus the observed effect is likely a functional consequence of an HHV8 gene product and not a trivial result of TPA carryover from the induced BCBL-1 cells. Conversely, in a reciprocal experiment, when HHV8 gene expression was analyzed, the level of vIL-6 RNA was increased significantly when BCBL-1 cells were fused with TPA-induced ACH2 cells (Fig.1 B). We next attempted to define the HHV8 responsive element within the HIV-1 LTR. Six scanning mutants that abrogated separately the NF-κB sites, the Sp1 sites, or the TATA element were utilized (Fig. 2 A). Although the basal activities of each of the mutant promoters were different when each was transfected into TPA-stimulated BCBL-1 cells, similar levels of HHV8-associated induction were observed. These results indicate that HHV8-responsiveness involves complex, rather than simple sequence motif(s). Control transfection of the same mutant promoters in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B) with or without TPA failed to show comparable activation consistent with activation being specific for BCBL-1-associated HHV8 gene product(s). To further clarify how HHV8 activates HIV-1, we sought to identify responsible viral gene product(s). Although current understanding of HHV8 gene functions remains incomplete, we reasoned, based on analogy to other herpesviruses, that immediate-early genes of HHV8 are plausible candidate activators of HIV-1. Hence, we cloned five immediate-early open-reading frames (ORFs) from HHV8 and tested for their effects on the HIV-1 LTR. Our results showed that out of these five ORFs, only KIE2 activated the HIV-1 LTR (Fig.3 A). To check whether activation by KIE2 of HIV-1 LTR correlates with that observed in BCBL-1 cells (Fig. 2) we tested the series of linker-scanning LTR mutants used above. Similar to the activation profiles in Fig. 2, KIE2 activated each linker-scanning mutant comparably (Fig. 3 B). Because the magnitude of activation by KIE2 alone was less than that observed in the ACH2-BCBL-1 fusion experiments (Fig. 1) we considered whether there could be a synergy between this HHV8 protein and the HIV-1 transactivator, Tat. Indeed, when KIE2 and Tat were coexpressed, a significantly synergistic activation was observed for the HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 4). Activation reached a level comparable to that observed in the cell-cell fusions (Fig. 1). The HIV-1 genome encodes two transcriptional transactivators, Tat and Vpr. We reasoned that Tat and/or Vpr might account for HHV8 activation by HIV-1. Using LipofectAMINE, we could achieve only a 10–20% transfection efficiency of BCBL-1 cells. On the other hand, using electroporation we routinely transfected up to 40% of BCBL-1 cells. When BCBL-1 cells were electroporated with expression vectors expressing either Vpr or Tat (Fig. 5) a quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed highly enhanced expression of HHV8 major capsid protein (50Flore O. Gao S.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, functionally, both Vpr and Tat appear to be HIV-1 transcriptional activating counterparts of HHV8 KIE2. HHV8 is a large (∼170 kbp) double-stranded DNA herpesvirus (51Renne B. Lagunoff M. Zhong W. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8151-8154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 is a much smaller (∼10 kbp) retrovirus. Despite rather dramatic molecular dissimilarities between the two viral genomes, recent findings have provided compelling evidence that these two viruses interact to promote KS pathogenesis in dually infected individuals. Indeed, it is increasingly clear that, although the HHV8 genome is invariably present in all described cases of KS (6Cathomas G. McGandy C.E. Teracciano L.M. Itin P.H. DeRosan G. Gudat F. J. Clin. Pathol. 1996; 49: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Buonaguro F.M. Tornesello M.L. Beth-Giraldo E. Hatzakis A. Mueller N. Downing R. Biryamwaho B. Sempala D.K. Giraldo G. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), most individuals who are singularly infected with HHV8 carry the virus in a latent state and do not present with KS disease. On the other hand, persons infected with both HHV8 and HIV-1 have up to a 100,000-fold increase, compared with infection with HHV8 alone, in risk for developing KS (16Beral V. Peteman T.A. Berkelman R.L. Jaffe H.W. Lancet. 1990; 335: 123-127Abstract PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Based on this statistic, a reasonable deduction is that HHV8 is necessary but insufficient for producing KS and that HIV-1 is an important cofactor, which promotes HHV8 induced KS. How might HIV-1 contribute to the development of KS? The results from a large multicenter study on HHV8 and HIV-1 infected men established an unmistakable link between HIV-1-associated immunosuppression and HHV8-engendered KS (52Jacobson C.F. Jenkins F.J. Spinger G. Munoz A. Shah K.V. Phair J. Zhang Z.-F. Armenian H. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, in the same study it is interesting that when immunosuppression was excluded, an independent association was revealed between HIV-1 RNA expression and KS progression (52Jacobson C.F. Jenkins F.J. Spinger G. Munoz A. Shah K.V. Phair J. Zhang Z.-F. Armenian H. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The latter observation provided the impetus for us to systematically explore potentially more direct interactions between HHV8 and HIV-1. Efforts to identify more direct interactions between HHV8 and HIV-1 have, to date, centered largely on HIV-1-induced cytokines and the secretion of Tat protein from HIV-1-infected cells (53Mercader M. Taddeo B. Punella J.R. Chandran B. Nickoloff B.J. Foreman K.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1961-1971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 54Harrington W. Sieczkowski L. Sosa C. Chan-a-Sue S. Cai J.P. Cabrao L. Wood C. Lancet. 1997; 349: 774-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Intracellular interactions between the two viruses have been generally discounted, because a prevailing view has been that the two viruses infect different cell types. However, several points argue that such an assumption might not necessarily be warranted. First, it remains unclear as to what are the range of HHV8 susceptible cellsin vivo. Second, recent ex vivo infection studies clearly support that both HHV8 and HIV-1 can efficiently infect cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (35Froeman K.E. Kash J.J. Eilers D.B. Nickoloff B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 603Google Scholar, 36Moses S.V. Fish K. Ruhl R. Smith P. Chandran B. Nelson J.A. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1999; 21: A28Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, Spearman and colleagues (37Varthakavi V. Browning P.J. Spearman P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10329-10338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have intriguingly demonstrated that HHV8-genome containing B lymphocytes, in fact, can be infected by HHV-1 via a cell-cell pathway and that such infected B lymphocytes could support productive HIV-1 replication. Here we have tried to define which virally encoded component of HIV-1 and HHV8 might reciprocally influence each other's expression inside cells. Our cell fusion results (Fig. 1) indicate that when both genomes exist in the same cellular environment there is a bilateral transcriptional effect between the two viruses. Among the many ORFs that are encoded by HHV8, we found that the KIE2 protein was sufficient for singularly inducing transcription from the HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 3). On the other hand, two HIV-1-encoded factors, Tat and Vpr, were capable of individually activating HHV8 transcription (Fig. 5). Although Tat has previously been invoked to affect HHV8 expression (55Ensoli G. Gendelman R. Markham P. Fiorelli V. Colombini S. Raffeld M. Cafaro S. Chang H.K. Brady J.N. Gallo R.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 56Kelly G.D. Ensoli B. Gunthel C.J. Offermann M.K. AIDS. 1998; 12: 1753-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the finding here that Vpr provides a similar activity adds further complexity to the interplay between HIV-1 and HHV8. The concept of reciprocal interaction between HHV8 and HIV-1 potentially offers an explanation for the rapid development of KS in HHV8-infected individuals whom are subsequently infected with HIV-1. Thus, in this dually infected subpopulation, the risk for KS development/progression escalates quickly, with a 60% increase for each year of HIV-1 infection (52Jacobson C.F. Jenkins F.J. Spinger G. Munoz A. Shah K.V. Phair J. Zhang Z.-F. Armenian H. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If, as suggested here, HIV-1 infection might transcriptionally activate HHV8 genome from latency, and, if such activation of HHV8 leads to further amplification of HIV-1 transcription, then one could imagine how such a feedback-cycle might accelerate disease manifestation. Indeed consistent with this scenario, an interruption of this cycle through treating HIV-1 with reverse transcriptase (RT) or protease inhibitors has been shown to efficaciously induce the regression of KS (45Biggar R.J. Rabkin C.S. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North. Am. 1996; 10: 997-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Future investigation toward understanding how to further intervene against the molecular interplay between HHV8 and HIV-1 should usefully advance the treatment of KS.

The transcription cofactor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) has previously been implicated in mediating NF-E2 function. In this report, we examined the role of CBP, a coactivator with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, in the regulation of NF-E2. We found that both the hematopoietic-specific subunit of NF-E2, p45, and the widely expressed small subunit, MafG, interact with CBP in vitro and in vivo. CBP acetylates MafG, but not p45, predominantly in the basic region of MafG. Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-acetyl lysine antibodies demonstrate that MafG is acetylated in vivo in erythroid cells. Transfection experiments further show that CBP stimulates MafG acetylation in intact cells in an E1A-sensitive manner. Acetylation of MafG augments DNA binding activity of NF-E2, and mutations at the major acetylation sites markedly reduce DNA binding and transcriptional activation by NF-E2. Together, these results suggest that recruitment of CBP by NF-E2 to specific erythroid/megakaryocytic promoters might regulate transcription by at least two mechanisms involving both modification of chromatin structure and modulation of transcription factor activity.

Despite the high levels of p45 expression in erythroid cells, mice that are null for p45 displayed a surprisingly mild defect in globin gene expression, suggesting that other members of the CNC protein family can substitute for p45 function in vivo(12Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).The N terminus of p45 contains an activation domain that is important for the biological activity of p45 (13Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H.

The small Maf proteins lack a typical activation domain and are believed to activate transcription as heterodimers with members of the CNC family of proteins. Small Maf proteins can also form homodimers and repress transcription (19Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).CBP and its close relative p300 serve as coactivators for a large and diverse set of nuclear factors (20Shikama N. Lyon J. LaThangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 21Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar).

Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation is associated with a relaxed chromatin configuration, suggesting that coactivators act in part through modifying chromatin structure. Consistent with this idea, at the chicken β-globin gene locus, the area of general DNaseI sensitivity coincides well with the region of elevated histone acetylation (24Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hyper-acetylation of histones H3 and H4 was observed at the human β-globin LCR and at the transcribed β-globin gene when compared with the acetylation status of the inactive β-like globin genes (25Schubeler D. Franxastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I.K. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar, 26Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Christensen H.M. Im H. Nuzzi P.A. H B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Together, these findings suggest that erythroid transcription factors might recruit histone-modifying enzymes such as CBP/p300 to the LCR and globin gene locus, thereby altering chromatin structure (27Blobel G.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This idea is supported by our observation that E1A-mediated inactivation of CBP/p300 in erythroid cells leads to a block in cell differentiation and globin gene induction (28Blobel G.A. Nakajima T.

A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).A new layer of complexity in the function of acetyltransferases emerged with the discovery that CBP/p300 also acetylates a variety of transcription factors. Acetylation can alter transcriptional activity through several mechanisms. For example, acetylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 strongly increases its affinity for DNA (30Gu W. Roeder R.G.

A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 34Hung H.-L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mutations in the acetylation sites in GATA-1 compromise its function in erythroid cells, suggesting that GATA-1 acetylation is biologically relevant (34Hung H.-L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Recent studies implicated CBP/p300 in the regulation of NF-E2 activity by showing that E1A, which inhibits CBP/p300 function, reduced the enhancer activity of HS2 and that NF-E2 was an important target of E1A-mediated inhibition (35Forsberg E.C. Johnson K. Zaboikina T.N. Mosser E.A. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26850-26859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments showed that p45 binds CBP in vitro (16Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Here we report that both subunits of NF-E2 interact with CBP in vitro. In addition, NF-E2 can recruit CBP to a DNA template containing NF-E2 binding sites. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate in vivo association between MafG and CBP in erythroid cells. CBP acetylates MafG predominantly in the basic region, thereby stimulating DNA binding of NF-E2. Mutations at the major acetylation sites reduce DNA binding and transcriptional activation by NF-E2. Thus, recruitment of CBP by NF-E2 might serve two functions, regulation of chromatin structure and transcription factor activity.DISCUSSIONIn this report we demonstrate that both subunits of NF-E2 interact with CBP. We further show that MafG and CBP associate in erythroid cells. CBP and acetylates MafG in vitro and in vivo mainly in the basic region, thereby increasing DNA binding and transcriptional activation of NF-E2.Our observation that both subunits of NF-E2 bind to CBP suggests that the complex might be stabilized by multiple protein contacts in vivo. It is possible that by binding to both subunits, CBP might stimulate heterodimer formation, leading to enhanced DNA binding independent of protein acetylation. Recruitment of CBP to the β-globin LCR might be aided further by the presence of additional erythroid transcription factors that interact with CBP. Both GATA-1 and EKLF fulfill these criteria since GATA-1 and EKLF binding sites are important elements at the LCR, and both factors have been shown to bind CBP (28Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). GATA-1 and EKLF are also acetylated by CBP (29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 34Hung H.-L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), indicating that a common theme underlies the regulation of structurally diverse nuclear factors involved in globin gene expression.In agreement with a requirement of CBP for LCR function, interference with CBP/p300 activity leads to a complete block in globin gene expression and erythroid differentiation (28Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In the context of HS2, NF-E2 binding sites are the predominant E1A-sensitivecis-acting elements, implicating a functional link between NF-E2 and CBP (35Forsberg E.C. Johnson K. Zaboikina T.N. Mosser E.A. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26850-26859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the effects of E1A on globin gene expression are the combined result of inhibition of GATA-1, EKLF, and NF-E2 function.In vitro acetylation of MafG by CBP occurs predominantly at a fragment in the basic region containing four lysine residues. Further deletion analysis showed that each of two lysine pairs (residues 53 and 60, and 71 and 76, respectively) contributes to MafG acetylation. Although all four lysines account for the majority of MafG acetylation when assayed alone or in a complex with p45, the relative contribution of each single lysine to the total acetylation of MafG remains to be determined. All four sites are conserved among all small Maf proteins and across all species examined (44Onodera K. Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Katsuoka F. Akasaka J.-E. Engel J.D. Yamamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21162-21169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are functionally important. Minor acetylation was also observed at the N terminus and the leucine zipper. The functional significance of these acetylation sites is unknown. In contrast, in vivoacetylation as determined by anti-AK immunoprecipitation experiments showed virtually no acetylation outside the basic region (Fig.5 C). This suggests that the basic region is the major acetylation site in vivo. However, it is possible that the anti-AK antibodies used may have selectivity toward the acetylated residues in the basic region.Although the molecular consequences of GATA-1 and EKLF acetylation are not yet established (29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 33Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 34Hung H.-L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), this work shows that acetylation by CBP augments DNA binding of NF-E2. Although acetylation of MafG might increase DNA binding by multiple mechanisms, the observation that acetylation occurs predominantly in the basic region suggests that it might directly increase the affinity of MafG for DNA. Although the residues in MafG that contact DNA have not been determined, the crystal structure of the yeast bZip protein GCN4 complexed with DNA provides some insight into how bZip proteins contact DNA (45Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In GCN4, the underlined residues of theNTEAARRSR motif in the basic region contact the central 7 base pairs in the GCN4 binding site. Two of the four major acetylation sites in MafG (aa 60 and aa 71, inbold) directly flank theKNXXYAXXCRYK core motif (Fig. 4 B), supporting a possible role for acetylation in the formation of DNA contacts. However, it remains possible that acetylation might stimulate DNA binding by triggering allosteric changes in NF-E2, similar to what has been described for p53 (30Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Some acetylation of MafG was also observed in the leucine zipper domain, suggesting that this might stimulate heterodimerization with p45, thereby indirectly increasing DNA binding. However, two observations suggest that this is unlikely. First, in vitro protein binding studies failed to yield any significant differences in dimerization of acetylated and nonacetylated MafG with p45. Second, acetylation in the zipper domain both in vitro and in vivo is minimal when compared with the acetylation observed in the basic region. Although an acetylation-induced increase in DNA binding was observed on two distinct NF-E2 elements derived from the PBGD promoter and human HS2, respectively, it remains possible that acetylation might lead to subtle changes in DNA binding site preferences between variant NF-E2 sites. Comparable increases in DNA binding upon acetylation have been observed in several transcription factors (21Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). One can envision at least two scenarios regarding the order of events. First, DNA binding of NF-E2 might occur before recruitment of CBP and NF-E2 acetylation. In this case, acetylation might stabilize the NF-E2 complex on DNA. Second, CBP and NF-E2 might be bound to each other in solution before DNA binding. In this event, acetylation might increase the rate of association of NF-E2 with its cognate binding element. Our observation that CBP can bind and acetylate NF-E2 in solution in the absence of DNA is consistent with the latter possibility.We showed that acetylation-defective NF-E2 (NF-E2-4A) has diminished transcriptional activity in transient reporter gene assays, further suggesting that acetylation of NF-E2 is important for its function. However, NF-E2-4A still retained significant activity, especially at higher amounts of transfected DNA. This suggests that the reduced affinity of NF-E2-4A for DNA can be overcome by increased protein concentrations.The interaction between NF-E2 and CBP suggests that CBP regulates transcription by modulating chromatin structure as well as transcription factor activity. Although protein acetylation is an attractive mechanism by which CBP acts at the LCR or other erythroid or megakaryocytic genes, additional mechanisms have to be considered as well. For example, since CBP also contacts certain components of the basal transcription machinery (for review see Refs. 20Shikama N. Lyon J. LaThangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar and 21Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar), it might mediate enhancer activity of the LCR in an acetylation-independent manner, for example by bridging to the globin gene core promoters. Furthermore, NF-E2 has been shown to associate with a chromatin remodeling activity (46Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gong Q. McDowell J.C. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6055-6064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CBP-independent activities might contribute to NF-E2 function. Analogously, EKLF associates with E-RC1, an SNF/SWI-related protein complex with ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity (48Armstrong J.A. Bieker J.J. Emerson B.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It is possible that ATP-dependent remodeling complexes and AT complexes act in different promoter contexts. Alternatively, it is conceivable that ATP-dependent and AT-containing complexes act sequentially at the same genes, similar to what has been described for the yeast HO gene (49Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 50Krebs J.E. Kuo M.-H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The basic-zipper (bZip)1transcription factor NF-E2 plays a critical role in erythroid and megakaryocytic gene expression (for review see Ref. 1Andrews N.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NF-E2 binds to an extended AP-1-like element, TGCTGA(G/C)TCA, which is found in the locus control regions (LCRs) of the α- and β-globin genes and in the promoters of several heme biosynthetic enzyme genes (for review see Refs. 2Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 3Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)). NF-E2 binding sites in the DNase I hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) of the β-globin LCR are essential for its enhancer activity (4Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K. Nienhuis A.W.

NF-E2 is a heterodimer consisting of a hematopoietic-specific subunit p45, which is a member of the cap and collar (CNC) family, and a more widely expressed small subunit, which is a member of the small Maf protein family (MafG, MafK, and MafF) (for review see Refs. 2Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 3Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)). MafG and MafK are the predominant small Maf molecules in erythroid cells and megakaryocytes (7Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J.-E. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). p45 and a small Maf protein dimerize through their leucine zipper domains to generate a composite DNA binding domain that consists of the basic regions of both molecules. Other members of the CNC family, including Nrf1 (8Chan J.Y. Han X.L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), Nrf2 (9Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), Nrf3 (10Kobayashi A. Ito E. Toki T. Kogame K. Takahashi S. Igarashi K.

Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) can also dimerize with small Maf proteins. Despite the high levels of p45 expression in erythroid cells, mice that are null for p45 displayed a surprisingly mild defect in globin gene expression, suggesting that other members of the CNC protein family can substitute for p45 function in vivo(12Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The N terminus of p45 contains an activation domain that is important for the biological activity of p45 (13Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Bean T.L. Ney P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2509-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several molecules interact with this domain and are candidate mediators of p45 activity. These include TAFII130 (a component of the TFIID complex) (15Amrolia P.J. Ramamurthy L. Saluja D. Tanese N. Jane S.M. Cunningham J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10051-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) (16Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and several ubiquitin ligases (17Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24105-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Mosser E.A. Kasanov J.D. Forsberg E.C. Kay B.K. Ney P.A. Bresnick E.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13686-13695Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The small Maf proteins lack a typical activation domain and are believed to activate transcription as heterodimers with members of the CNC family of proteins. Small Maf proteins can also form homodimers and repress transcription (19Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). CBP and its close relative p300 serve as coactivators for a large and diverse set of nuclear factors (20Shikama N. Lyon J. LaThangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 21Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). CBP and p300 possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (AT) activity (21Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 23Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation is associated with a relaxed chromatin configuration, suggesting that coactivators act in part through modifying chromatin structure. Consistent with this idea, at the chicken β-globin gene locus, the area of general DNaseI sensitivity coincides well with the region of elevated histone acetylation (24Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hyper-acetylation of histones H3 and H4 was observed at the human β-globin LCR and at the transcribed β-globin gene when compared with the acetylation status of the inactive β-like globin genes (25Schubeler D. Franxastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I.K. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar, 26Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Christensen H.M. Im H. Nuzzi P.A. H B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14494-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that erythroid transcription factors might recruit histone-modifying enzymes such as CBP/p300 to the LCR and globin gene locus, thereby altering chromatin structure (27Blobel G.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This idea is supported by our observation that E1A-mediated inactivation of CBP/p300 in erythroid cells leads to a block in cell differentiation and globin gene induction (28Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2063587792,"The mechanism of signal transduction underlying the activation of platelets by collagen has been actively investigated for over 30 years, but the receptors involved remain incompletely understood. Studies of human platelets, which are unresponsive to collagen, mouse knockout models, and platelet biochemical studies support the hypothesis that the recently cloned platelet surface protein GPVI functions as a signaling receptor for collagen. To directly test this hypothesis, we have expressed wild-type and mutant forms of GPVI in RBL-2H3 cells, which express the Fcε receptor γ-chain (Fc Rγ), the putative signaling co-receptor for GPVI in platelets, but lack GPVI itself. Expression of GPVI in RBL-2H3 cells confers strong adhesive and signaling responses to convulxin (a snake venom protein that directly binds GPVI) and weak responsiveness to collagen-related peptide but no responsiveness to collagen. To elucidate the mechanism of GPVI intracellular signaling, mutations were introduced in the receptor's transmembrane domain and C-terminal tail. Unlike reported studies of other Fc Rγ partners, these studies reveal that both the GPVI transmembrane arginine and intracellular C-tail are necessary for coupling to Fc Rγ and for signal transduction. To our knowledge, these studies are the first to demonstrate a direct signaling role for GPVI and the first to directly test the role of GPVI as a collagen receptor. Our results suggest that GPVI may be necessary but not sufficient for collagen signaling and that a distinct ligand-binding collagen receptor such as the α2β1 integrin is likely to play a necessary role for collagen signaling as well as adhesion in platelets.

Platelet activation is essential for both normal hemostasis and arterial thrombosis that occurs in the setting of vascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction. One of the earliest steps in arterial thrombosis is the adhesion of circulating platelets to areas of injured vessel wall and the activation of adherent platelets, which recruits additional platelets to form a hemostatic plug. Activation of platelets at sites of vascular injury occurs in response to exposed subendothelial matrix proteins, the most important of which is collagen. Exposed collagen initiates two essential platelet functions: the adhesion of circulating platelets to the site of injury and the activation of platelet signaling, which stimulates thrombus growth. Platelet adhesion to collagen has been shown to occur both indirectly, via interaction of platelet GPIb with plasma von Willebrand's factor bound to exposed collagen (1Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and directly, via collagen interaction with the platelet integrin α2β1 (2Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In contrast, although the activation of platelets by collagen has been observed for over 30 years (3Wilner G.D. Nossel H.L. LeRoy E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47: 2616-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate platelet activation by collagen are only beginning to be fully understood. Indirect evidence suggests that both α2β1 and GPIb can initiate signaling when bound to collagen (1Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M.

However, this signaling does not appear to be sufficient to account for the magnitude of the platelet response to collagen. GPVI is a recently cloned 62-kDa surface protein (6Clemetson J.M. Polgar J.

GPVI was proposed as a signaling receptor for collagen following the description of individuals with bleeding disorders whose platelets could not be activated by collagen and lacked GPVI despite having normal levels of the platelet integrin α2β1(9Sugiyama T.

Significant evidence suggests that GPVI signaling is sufficient to activate platelets and that GPVI may mediate collagen signaling in platelets.

In addition, collagen signaling and GPVI signaling in platelets both employ the immunoreceptor signaling pathway (14Watson S.P. Thromb.

These data have led to a model of collagen activation of platelets in which adhesive roles are played by the integrin α2β1 as well as GPIb and signaling roles are played by GPVI-Fc Rγ, α2β1, as well as perhaps GPIb (14Watson S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

Consistent with its putative role as an Fc Rγ partner, GPVI has a charged arginine residue in its transmembrane domain that may mediate interaction with the Fc Rγ transmembrane domain in a manner analogous to that of the known Fc Rγ partners Fcα RI and PIR-A (16Morton H.C. van den Herik-Oudijk I.E.

Direct functional evidence demonstrating that GPVI is a collagen receptor and that GPVI signaling is mediated by Fc Rγ, however, are lacking. Transient expression of GPVI has been demonstrated to confer a slight calcium signal to collagen in the DAMI megakaryocytic cell line (6Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29019-29024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), but these cells express endogenous GPVI (data not shown and Ref. 6Clemetson J.M. Polgar J.

Res. 1996; 82: 485-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and perhaps other collagen receptors; it is therefore not clear if that response is mediated directly by GPVI or if GPVI expression is sufficient to enhance signaling by α2β1 or other identified (e.g. p65 (20Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) or unidentified collagen receptors. To address the functional role of GPVI, we have stably expressed the receptor in RBL-2H3 cells, a rat basophilic leukemia cell line that expresses Fc Rγ and reproduces the platelet collagen responses of intracellular calcium mobilization and degranulation but does not express endogenous GPVI or α2β1. Our studies reveal that GPVI cross-linking by the GPVI-specific ligand convulxin initiates intracellular signaling but that GPVI alone is incapable of mediating a signaling response to collagen. A small signaling response is elicited by collagen-related peptides (CRPs), however, and static adhesion studies support interaction with convulxin and CRP but not collagen. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of the GPVI transmembrane domain and intracellular C-tail demonstrates that both the GPVI transmembrane arginine and the receptor C-tail are necessary for Fc Rγ interaction and intracellular signaling. These results provide insight into GPVI signal transduction and suggest that GPVI-signaling in response to collagen requires coreceptors for both ligand binding and intracellular signal transduction. Type I collagen derived from equine tendons was obtained from Chronolog (Havertown, PA) and used for all studies shown. Studies were confirmed with type I collagen derived from bovine tendon and type III collagen derived from calf skin (Sigma). Convulxin was obtained from Sigma and purified from the venom of theCrotalus durissus rattlesnake using gel filtration as previously described (13Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M.

CRPs were synthesized as previously described using cross-linked cysteine residues (21Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem.

A GPVI cDNA was generated by PCR from human platelet cDNA using primers based on published 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences (sense strand primer: 5′- TCAGGACAGGGCTGAGGAACC-3′; antisense strand primer: 5′-TTGGATACGACCGTGCCTGGG-3′). Three distinct amplified 1.1-kilobase pair products were sequenced to obtain a consensus sequence that exhibited several differences from the published cDNA (6Clemetson J.M. Polgar J. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol.

All GPVI receptor amino acids reported here correspond to the protein predicted by the open reading frame of this cDNA starting at nucleotide number 13. FLAG-tagged GPVI was generated by replacing the endogenous signal peptide with that of interleukin-1 and placing the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) in frame with GPVI at amino acid number 21, the predicted site of signal peptide cleavage (SignalP VI.I). HA-tagged GPVI was generated in an identical manner. Wild-type and epitope-tagged GPVI were expressed using the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide used for the R272L mutation was 5′- GCAACCTGGTCCGGATATGCCTCGGGGCTGTG-3′. The oligonucleotide used for the R295STOP mutation was 5′-GGCAGAGGACTGGCACAGCTAGAGGAAGCGCCTGC-3′. All mutants were made as epitope-tagged receptors as described above. Blood was collected into citrate buffer and platelet-rich plasma obtained as previously described (22Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). All studies were performed using platelet-rich plasma at a platelet density of 2 × 108 platelets/ml. RBL-2H3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were electroporated with linearized expression plasmids and selected in G418 (1.0 mg/ml active concentration; Life Technologies, Inc.) as previously described (23Hamawy M.M. Swieter M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30498-30503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wild-type GPVI-expressing clones were directly tested for signaling in response to convulxin (below) and epitope-tagged clones tested for receptor expression by flow cytometry using M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or anti-HA antibody (Sigma) as primary antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Increases in cytoplasmic calcium in response to convulxin, CRP, collagen, and thrombin were measured using the calcium-sensitive dye Fura-2 as previously described at a final cell concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml (24Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The buffer used for these studies was RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) with HEPES 25 mm and 1 mg/ml BSA. A stable HEK-293T cell line that stably expressed an N-terminally FLAG-tagged Fc Rγ in a manner identical to that previously described for DAP-12 (25Bakker A.B. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Steve Spusta (University of California at San Francisco). These cells expressed FLAG-Fc Rγ at a level such that no cell surface FLAG-Fc Rγ was detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting despite readily detectable intracellular FLAG-Fc Rγ by Western blot analysis (data not shown). HA-tagged wild-type and mutated GPVI receptors were transiently expressed in FLAG-Fc Rγ-expressing HEK-293T cells (Fugene6 transfection reagent; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Surface expression of GPVI was followed with anti-HA antibody, and surface expression of Fc Rγ was followed with anti-FLAG antibody using flow cytometry as previously described for DAP-12 (25Bakker A.B. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Rescue of surface expression of FLAG-Fc Rγ was quantitated by comparing surface FLAG expression in GPVI-transfected versusmock-transfected 293T-FLAG-Fc Rγ cells as previously described (25Bakker A.B.

CVX was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 200 nm per ml of swollen gel. RBL-2H3 cells (total of ∼1 × 107) were lysed for 2 h at 4 °C in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin (Calbiochem), 0.12% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) NaN3, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, and containing a 1:100 (v/v) dilution of a mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Detergent-insoluble cellular debris was pelleted at 10,000 ×gav for 15 min, and 50 μl of CVX-Sepharose beads were used to immunoprecipitate GPVI from the supernatant in a 2-h incubation period. Sepharose beads that had been activated by 1 mm HCl and blocked in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m sodium chloride were used as controls for nonspecific binding. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CHAPS, containing 1:100 (v/v) protease inhibitors). Finally, beads were heated to 100 °C in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 m DTT, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), and an aliquot was run on 5–20% (v/v) gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a standard electrophoresis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m glycine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Gels were transferred (50 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm glycine, 0.037% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) methanol) to Hybond-P nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blocked overnight in blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk, 5% (w/v) BSA, and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20), and probed with antibodies to the FLAG epitope (Bio-M2 (Sigma)) and the Fc Rγ (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) diluted 1:3000 (v/v) and 1:1500 (v/v), respectively, in blocking buffer. These antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 (v/v) in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and membranes were developed using the ECL method (ECL-Plus; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 96-Well polystyrene high binding plates (Costar 3590; Corning Glass) were coated with 50 μl/well of 20 μg/ml BSA, convulxin, collagen, and fibronectin or 15 μg/ml CRP in PBS with 0.9 mm calcium and 0.4 mm magnesium overnight at 4 °C. Prior to application, the pH of the diluted protein solution was adjusted to pH 7–8. The plates were blocked with 150 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA for 2 h at room temperature and washed with PBS with 0.9 mm calcium and 0.4 mm magnesium twice. RBL-2H3 cells were detached from plates with 5 mm EDTA, washed with PBS or saline solution containing 3 mm Ca2+ and 1.5 mmMg2+, and suspended in the same solution at a cell concentration of 2 × 106/ml. 2 × 105 cells were applied to each well. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed with the same solution seven times. To read the number of cells bound to each well, the β-hexosaminidase activity assay was used as previously described (26Posner R.G. Subramanian K. Goldstein B. Thomas J. Feder T. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3601-3609PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS were added to each well to lyse the bound cells. 80 μl of 1 mm substrate (p-nitrophenolN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide; Sigma catalog no. N9376) in 0.05 m citrate buffer, pH 4.5, were subsequently added. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of 0.1m sodium carbonate, 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate were added per well. The A405 was measured with an Emax precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing wild-type GPVI (GPVI-RBL) and FLAG-tagged GPVI (FLAG GPVI-RBL) were identified using adhesion to convulxin and flow cytometry to detect surface FLAG epitope, respectively. The ability of the putative GPVI ligands collagen, CRP, and convulxin to initiate calcium signaling in RBL, GPVI-RBL, and FLAG GPVI-RBL was tested in parallel with aggregation studies of human platelets performed using the same reagents on the same day (Fig. 1, TableI, and data not shown). GPVI-RBL and FLAG GPVI-RBL, but not untransfected RBL cells, responded to convulxin with a threshold concentration only 1.6-fold greater than that found necessary to aggregate human platelets (0.3 nm). These results demonstrate functional GPVI signaling and close concordance between the two assays for GPVI dose response, suggesting similar GPVI receptor density in the two cell types. In contrast, collagen elicited no response even at concentrations 500 times greater than that necessary to aggregate human platelets (100 μg/ml). Similar results were obtained using three distinct GPVI-RBL clones and three distinct FLAG-GPVI RBL clones. The data shown are representative of experiments performed in RPMI with Chronolog Type I collagen, which elicits the most robust platelet responses in our hands (data not shown). In addition, no signaling responses were observed using a second source of type I collagen, type III collagen, or in the presence of higher cation concentrations (1 mm calcium and 0.5 mmmagnesium; data not shown). Interestingly, CRP was capable of eliciting a small calcium response but required a concentration 500 times greater than that necessary to induce platelet aggregation (50 μg/ml). CRP signaling responses were also only seen with the two GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cell clones that had the greatest sensitivity to convulxin. These data demonstrate that GPVI is a functional receptor but that GPVI expression alone is insufficient to reproduce the collagen and CRP signaling responses observed in platelets.Table IComparison of signaling by putative GPVI ligands in GPVI-expressing RBL cells and in plateletsAgonistPlatelet activationGPVI-RBL signalingPlatelet/GPVI RBL signaling ratioConvulxin0.3 nm0.5 nm1:1.6CRP0.1 μg/ml50 μg/ml1:500Collagen0.2 μg/ml>100 μg/ml>1:500The threshold concentrations of the platelet agonists convulxin, CRP, and collagen necessary to induce platelet aggregation were determined using platelet aggregometry and compared with those necessary for detection of calcium signaling in GPVI-expressing RBL cells using fluorimetry.

Open table in a new tab The threshold concentrations of the platelet agonists convulxin, CRP, and collagen necessary to induce platelet aggregation were determined using platelet aggregometry and compared with those necessary for detection of calcium signaling in GPVI-expressing RBL cells using fluorimetry. Note the close concordance between the two assays for the GPVI-specific ligand convulxin and the significant discrepancy for the putative GPVI ligands CRP and collagen. To determine whether expression of GPVI is sufficient to mediate adhesion but not signaling to collagen, static adhesion assays were performed with wild-type and GPVI-expressing RBL cells (GPVI RBL and FLAG-GPVI RBL generated identical results; data not shown). Expression of GPVI conferred strong adhesion to convulxin and moderate adhesion to CRP, but no adhesion to collagen was detected (Fig. 2). GPVI R272L- and GPVI R295STOP-expressing RBL clones, which express ∼5-fold and 10–50-fold more surface GPVI than FLAG-GPVI, respectively (Fig.3), also failed to bind collagen despite binding both CRP and CVX. Performing the assay using normal saline with 1 mm calcium and 0.5 mm magnesium yielded identical results (data not shown). In addition, no adhesion of GPVI-expressing or wild-type RBL cells was observed to bovine type I collagen or to bovine type III collagen (data not shown). Wild-type RBL cells adhered only to fibronectin (Fig. 2). Unlike fibronectin binding, GPVI-mediated adhesion to CRP and convulxin was not disrupted by 5 mm EDTA (Fig. 2B), consistent with a nonintegrin-mediated mechanism of adhesion. Thus, adhesion assays of GPVI-expressing RBL cells are consistent with signaling assays and show strong GPVI interaction with convulxin, weaker GPVI interaction with CRP, and no GPVI interaction with collagen.Figure 3Expression and function of GPVI transmembrane and C-tail mutants in RBL-2H3 cells.

These results are representative of identical experiments performed with 3–5 distinct clones for each receptor type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The signaling roles of the GPVI transmembrane (TM) domain arginine (R272) and intracellular C-tail were tested by generating RBL cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged receptors in which the TM arginine is replaced by leucine (R272L-RBL) and the C-tail is truncated shortly following the TM domain (R295STOP-RBL). Both mutant GPVI receptors were expressed on the surface of RBL cells at levels equal to or greater than clones expressing wild-type GPVI (Fig.3B). Consistent with the results of analogous mutations in related receptors, R272L-RBL did not signal in response to convulxin, confirming a necessary role for the GPVI TM domain arginine for signal transduction. Surprisingly, unlike similar C-tail truncation mutants of the Fc Rγ partners Fcε RI and Fcγ RIII (see Fig. 6), RBL cells expressing the GPVI C-tail truncation mutant R295STOP also failed to signal to convulxin, demonstrating an unexpected necessary role for the GPVI C-tail (Fig. 3C). To determine why the R272L and R295STOP mutants of GPVI no longer supported signaling by CVX, we compared the ability of wild-type and mutant GPVI receptors to interact with Fc Rγ with a functional assay in HEK-293T cells stably expressing FLAG Fc Rγ and by direct biochemical means using coprecipitation. As for HEK-293T cells engineered to express low levels of the homologous immunoreceptor signaling adaptor DAP-12(25), FLAG-Fc Rγ is not expressed on the cell surface of these cells in the absence of a coexpressed Fc Rγ partner (Fig.4A). The ability of an expressed receptor to rescue surface expression of FLAG-Fc Rγ therefore measures functional association with Fc Rγ. Wild-type GPVI expression rescued 10 times more surface FLAG-Fc Rγ than mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, GPVI R272L expression failed to rescue any FLAG-Fc Rγ, consistent with a complete loss of association with Fc Rγ (Fig. 4A). GPVI R295STOP expression also failed to rescue surface FLAG-Fc Rγ, indicating a lack of Fc Rγ interaction (Fig. 4A). Surface staining for the HA epitope confirmed that wild-type and mutant GPVI receptors were expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 4B) and demonstrates that, as for the related Fc Rγ partner PIRα (18Ono M. Yuasa T. Ra C. Takai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30288-30296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), GPVI expression in HEK-293T cells does not require Fc Rγ interaction.

BACE is a type I transmembrane aspartyl protease of 501 amino acids. Here we describe a novel BACE mRNA lacking 132 base pairs that is expressed in the pancreas but not in the brain. Sequence alignment indicates that the deleted fragment matches the terminal two-thirds of exon 3. The new BACE variant is short of a 44-amino acid region located between the two catalytic aspartyl residues. Accordingly, a 50-kDa form of BACE (BACE457) is detected in the human pancreas. When expressed in cells, BACE457 colocalizes with the marker for the endoplasmic reticulum BiP. Moreover, BACE457 remains in a proenzymatic and endoglycosidase H-sensitive state, suggesting that its transport along the secretory pathway is blocked at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum. Notably, this novel form of BACE does not contribute to the processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Our findings suggest that tissue-specific splicing of the BACE mRNA may explain the observation that in the human pancreas robust transcription of the BACE gene does not translate into recovered enzymatic activity. β-Secretase (BACE) initiates the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein leading to the generation of the β-amyloid, the main component of Alzheimer's disease senile plaques.

In situ hybridization studies demonstrated homogenous expression of the BACE mRNA in neurons of all brain regions, whereas glial cells appeared to express little or no BACE (12Vassar R. Bennett B.D.

In contrast, little or no BACE activity is detected in peripheral tissues including the human pancreas, although high expression of its mRNA is found in this tissue (13Sinha S. Anderson J.P.

Here we show that an endoplasmic reticulum-retained pancreatic form of BACE resulting from differential mRNA splicing is deficient in APP processing. The rabbit polyclonal antisera GM190 (20Capell A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30849-30854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), 815, and 818 were raised against synthetic antigens corresponding to peptides 22–45, 46–61 (with an additional carboxyl-terminal cysteine), and 484–501 of BACE501. Antisera 815 and 818 were affinity purified using commercially available reagents with the corresponding covalently coupled peptide. All antisera reacted equally well against BACE501 and BACE457. The monoclonal antibody β1 was raised as described previously (9Schrader-Fischer G. Paganetti P.A. Brain Res. 1996; 716: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibodies 6E10 and α-GRP 78 are commercially available (Senetek; StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.). The BACE501 and the BACE457 cDNAs were amplified by seminested polymerase chain reaction from a human brain cDNA library. For the first amplification, the primers BetaBHS1 (GATGTAGCGGGCTCCGGATC) and BetaR33 (GGGGAATTCACTTCAGCAGGGAGATGTCATCAG) were used. For the second reaction, the primer pair BetaBHS2 (GCGGATCCACCATGGCCCAAGCCC) and BetaR33 was chosen. Subsequently the cDNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of an appropriate vector for cytomegalovirus-regulated mammalian expression. For specific detection of BACE501 or BACE457, primers overlapping the respective exon/exon boundaries were chosen. Primers 501s (TGCCAGGCCTGACG) or 457s (GGCACCGACCTGCCT) were used in combination with primer BetaR33 in a seminested polymerase chain reaction on human pancreas and brain cDNA libraries (CLONTECH), as well as on cDNA synthesized from total human pancreas poly(A+) RNA (CLONTECH). Pancreatic cDNA and poly(A+) RNA were obtained from different pools of human tissues. cDNA synthesis was performed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the random priming method according to the manufacturer's protocol. The BACE501 and BACE457 plasmids were used as positive or negative template controls. Cultured cells were extracted 48 h post-transfection in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, 1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Tissue samples from human cortex or pancreas were homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Subsequently the supernatants were centrifuged at 4 °C for 90 min at 100,000 × g. The new supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer by ultrasonic treatment. For PNGase F treatment pancreas homogenate or cell extracts were incubated with PNGase F overnight at 30 °C in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% β-octyl glycoside. For immunoprecipitation of C99 from extracts of HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type APP (9Schrader-Fischer G. Paganetti P.A. Brain Res. 1996; 716: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), antibody β1 and protein A-Sepharose were used. Subsequently, the precipitates or cell extracts were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and detected using primary antibodies as indicated. HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For metabolic labeling, cells were starved for 30 min in Met/Cys-free DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Subsequently, cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Cys/Met (Expre35S35S protein labeling mix; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Met/Cys-free DMEM, 5% dialyzed FCS and chased for 1 h or as indicated in DMEM, 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cell extracts were obtained in RIPA buffer after a short centrifugation. Equal amounts of labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated using 1.5 μl of 818 or GM190 antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Endo H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) treatment, immunoprecipitated BACE501 or BACE457 was eluted from protein A-Sepharose with a 10-min, 100 °C treatment in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Each sample was split into two aliquots. Sodium citrate (to a final concentration of 50 mm, pH 5.5) and, if indicated, 5 milliunits of Endo H were added to the samples and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Transfected cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated chamber slides (Costar). For immunostaining, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde or 5% methanol/acetic acid (95/5) at −20 °C. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with the antibodies α-GRP 78 (anti-BiP) at 1:200 dilution, 815 at 1:500 dilution, and 818 at 1:2000 dilution. Alexa-488 and Alexa-594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at 1:500 dilution. Stained cells were embedded in Mowiol (Calbiochem). To assemble the genomic sequence of BACE, component genomic fragments representing the BACE exons were identified by searching GenBankTM with the cDNA sequence. high-throughput genomic sequencing (HTGS) draft sequences AC020997 and AP001822 were found to include sequences representing the full-length cDNA. These entries were split into their component contigs. An iterative method alternating sequence search and assembly steps was then applied to these contigs to build the intervening introns. To address the discrepancy observed in pancreas,i.e. efficient transcription of the BACE mRNA in the absence of recovered enzymatic activity, we searched for differential mRNA splicing. Initially, we amplified the BACE cDNA from a human brain cDNA library by nested polymerase chain reaction. Restriction mapping was performed with restriction enzymes expected to digest the full-length BACE cDNA. Using this strategy, we identified a DNA fragment that was not digested by NcoI and StuI (not shown). This suggested the existence of a BACE transcript lacking a fragment of at least 120 base pairs. We then designed several polymerase chain reaction primers specific for the region around the NcoI and StuI sites. Accordingly, we confirmed the existence of a differentially spliced BACE mRNA in human pancreas that was not detectable in human brain (Fig. 1). The amplification of the splice variant was confirmed using a cDNA pancreatic library, as well as using a distinct poly(A+) RNA pool. In contrast to this, the full-length form of BACE was expressed in brain but was not detected in pancreas (Fig. 1). Sequencing analysis indicated that 132 base pairs were missing in this cDNA compared with that of full-length BACE. To validate these findings, we screened the GenBankTM data base to gain information on the structure of the human BACE gene. We found that the BACE open reading frame was distributed over nine exons covering about 26 kilobases of the human genome (Fig.2). The first intron accounted for about 18.6 kilobases. All other introns ranged in length between 1526 bases (intron 2) and 240 bases (intron 7). The 132 base pairs missing in the proposed differentially spliced mRNA appeared to match the terminal two-thirds of exon 3 (Fig. 2). Alignment of the exon/exon boundaries between several members of the human aspartyl protease family at the protein level showed no conserved pattern (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the only exon/exon boundary that was located in a conserved position corresponded to the 5′ start of the differentially spliced intron. Lack of the 132 base pairs would cause an in-frame deletion of 44 amino acids in the full-length BACE (hereafter referred to as BACE457; see Fig. 2). Moreover, the deletion in BACE457 would eliminate in the full-length BACE (BACE501) two of the four consensus sites forN-glycosylation (Fig. 2). Based on this, BACE457 should migrate faster than BACE501 when separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In fact, recombinant BACE457 expressed in HEK-293 cells was revealed as an immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa using the specific antibody 815 raised against the amino terminus of BACE (Fig.3A, upper panel,lane 2). In contrast, BACE501 migrated mainly as a diffuse band of about 65 kDa (Fig. 3A, upper panel,lane 1). Analysis of membrane protein isolated from three distinct human pancreatic samples revealed a specific immunoreactive protein comigrating with the recombinant BACE457 (Fig. 3A,upper panel, lanes 4–6). Practically identical results were obtained when the carboxyl-terminal-specific 818 antibody was used, indicating that BACE457 extends between the same amino and carboxyl termini as full-length BACE501 (Fig. 3A,lower panel). BACE457, but not BACE501, was also detected in total pancreatic homogenates (not shown). When brain membranes or total brain homogenates were used, we were not able to detect either BACE457 or BACE501 (Fig. 3A, lane 7 or data not shown). Full-length BACE has been reported to be expressed in the brain in a barely detectable amount (12Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P.

Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Both recombinant and pancreatic BACE457 were glycosylated, most likely at both remaining sites, as suggested by the 4-kDa shift to 46 kDa after PNGase digestion (Fig. 3B). In overexpressing HEK-293 cells, in addition to mature BACE501 migrating as a diffuse protein band of about 65 kDa, the deglycosylated and Endo H-sensitive forms of BACE501 migrated at 48 and 55 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2), as reported by others (19Haniu M.

Notably, we observed that the 50-kDa BACE457, in contrast to BACE501, did not acquire Endo H resistance (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the transport along the secretory pathway of the pancreatic variant of BACE was blocked at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum. To further explore this hypothesis, we analyzed whether the propeptide of BACE457 was cleaved off, a process shown to occur after exit from the endoplasmic reticulum for BACE501. As expected (19Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol.

On the other hand, we found that virtually all of BACE457 remained in the proenzymatic form over a period of 16 h (Fig. 4, lower panel). The presence of the propeptide would reduce the length of BACE457 to 20 and not 44 amino acids when compared with BACE501. This may explain the small difference observed in the apparent molecular masses (48 and 46 kDa, respectively) between the two deglycosylated forms. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that BACE501 is present on the cell surface (Fig. 5, panel 1), as well as along the secretory pathway,i.e. in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5, panels 2 and 3) when expressed in cells. Strengthening the evidence that BACE457 is retained in the early secretory pathway, the splice variant was not detected on the cell surface (Fig. 5, panel 4) but found exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum where it colocalized with the specific marker BiP (Fig. 5, panels 5 and 6). Overexpression of BACE501 was shown previously to increase β-secretase processing of APP (12Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P.

This can be monitored by an increase in cell-associated C99, the membrane-bound precursor of Aβ generated by β-secretase cleavage. Indeed, when BACE501 was expressed in cells, C99 production was increased as expected (Fig.6, lane 1). In sharp contrast to this, overexpression of BACE457 did not enhance the amyloidogenic processing of APP (Fig. 6, lane 2) when compared with the control (Fig. 6, lane 3). This was consistent with the observation that exit from the endoplasmic reticulum,i.e. full glycosylation and propeptide removal, is required to produce a proteolytic competent β-secretase/BACE.Figure 2Schematic representation of the 44-amino acid deletion generating BACE457.

The novel variant of BACE was found in the pancreas but was not detected in the brain. In contrast, we observed an opposite expression pattern of full-length BACE.

The novel splice form suggests an explanation for this apparent discrepancy. BACE457 lacks 44 amino acids located between the two catalytic aspartyl residues and containing two of four putative glycosylation sites. Such a deletion can be expected to cause misfolding of the protein, explaining the observed retention within the endoplasmic reticulum,e.g. by a quality control mechanism. With the strategy of analysis chosen, we cannot exclude at this point that additional splice variants of BACE may exist. Full glycosylation and activation by propeptide removal are post-translational modifications acquired during maturation and transport of BACE to a subcellular compartment where APP processing occurs. Failure to detect said modifications for the pancreatic variant is consistent with the observation that BACE457 was not found to contribute to the amyloidogenic processing of APP,i.e. increased formation of the carboxyl-terminal amyloidogenic intermediate C99. Lack of increased production of C99 also appears to exclude the notion that BACE457 may represent an endoplasmic reticulum form of active BACE. We also report the structure of the BACE gene. Both a novel pattern of exon/exon boundaries when compared with prorenin and pepsinogen A, as well as the first description of differential splicing for a gene encoding an aspartyl protease, might indicate that the BACE gene is derived by convergent evolution rather than by a gene duplication mechanism. The homology between BACE and the aspartyl protease family members (13Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K.

Exon 1 encodes the signal peptide, the propeptide, and the poorly conserved amino terminus of mature BACE. Exon 9 encodes the characteristic carboxyl terminus of BACE that includes the transmembrane spanning domain and the cytosolic tail. The expression of an inactive form of BACE in pancreas, as opposed to having the gene repressed transcriptionally, suggests an unknown function of this form of BACE that may be independent of proteolytic activity. Alternatively, because propeptide removal may not be required for activity, a difference in substrate specificity between the two differentially spliced forms of BACE cannot yet be excluded.

https://openalex.org/W2042009962,"ABP(57) is an auxin-binding protein that possesses receptor function. In this study, a protocol for ABP(57) purification was developed on the basis of cross-reactivity shown between ABP(57) and antisera raised against bovine serum albumin, which enabled us to purify ABP(57) with a high yield and to further characterize it. ABP(57) activates plant plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (PM H(+)-ATPase) via direct interaction. The binding of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to the primary binding site on ABP(57) caused a marked increase in the affinity of ABP(57) for PM H(+)-ATPase, which was accompanied by a change in ABP(57) conformation. Meanwhile, additional IAA binding to the secondary site on ABP(57) nullified the initial effect without inducing further conformational change. When ABP(57) with IAA occupying only the primary site interacted with PM H(+)-ATPase, no IAA could access the secondary site. These results suggest that IAA-induced biphasic alteration in the affinity of ABP(57) for PM H(+)-ATPase correlates with a bell-shaped dose response of the enzyme to IAA. There is also a possibility that, whereas the stimulation phase of the response is associated with a conformational change of ABP(57), the destimulation phase probably results from hindrance arising directly from the presence of IAA at the secondary site."

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar for a recent review of protein splicing). Thein vitro biochemical study of protein splicing has been hampered by the fact that it is a self-catalyzed process that requires neither accessory proteins nor cofactors (2Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and therefore proceeds rapidly under physiological conditions without the accumulation of intermediates. However, recent progress in the molecular dissection of inteins has made possible the expression of intein segments as fusion proteins that undergo protein splicing in trans after reconstitution in vitro (3Southworth M.W.

Protein splicing in trans requires the reassociation of an N-terminal and C-terminal fragment of an intein (N-intein and C-intein, respectively), each fused to an appropriate extein. Upon reassociation, the intein fragments form a functional protein-splicing active center, which mediates the formation of a peptide bond between the exteins, coupled to the excision of the N- and C-inteins (Fig.1). In the experiments described in this paper, we used two different in vitro trans-splicing systems. The first was derived from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecA intein. It consisted of a 105-residue N-intein fused to Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP)1 as the N-extein and a 107-residue C-intein fused to a polypeptide terminated with a His tag as the C-extein (4Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The functional reassociation of the RecA intein segments requires prior denaturation and joint renaturation (4Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), even if the C-intein is replaced by a polypeptide as short as 35 amino acid residues (7Lew B.M. Mills K.V. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15887-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second trans-splicing system was based on the naturally split DnaE intein of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (8Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), which has a 123-residue N-intein and a 36-residue C-intein and can undergo reassociation without prior denaturation (6Evans T.C.

For the purpose of these studies, we fused the DnaE N-intein, joined to the 16 C-terminal residues of the natural N-extein, to E. coli MBP and a synthetic C-intein fused to the 5 N-terminal residues of the natural C-extein, followed by a His tag. A recent crystallographic study of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA intein analog fused to short extein segments revealed that the intein contains a bound zinc ion (9Poland B.W. Xu M.-Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We decided to explore the effects of zinc ion on protein splicing using the experimental systems described above and discovered that zinc ion acts as a general and reversible inhibitor of protein splicing. No inhibitor of protein splicing had been available until now, and the reversible inhibition by Zn2+ therefore provides a valuable tool for the study of the mechanism of protein splicing and intein structure. Plasmid pMSNΔ encodes MSNΔ, an in-frame fusion of the E. coli MBP with the 16 C-terminal extein residues and the 123 intein residues of the N-terminal DnaE fragment of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. The corresponding segment of the N-terminal dnaE fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA, which had been isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection as strain 27184) as described (10Dzelkalns V.A. Bogorad L. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 964-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used to replace the six C-terminal residues of MBP and the entire RecA intein in plasmid pMU2 s/sΔ6 (4Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMSNΔcan thus be considered a derivative of plasmid pMal-c2x (New England Biolabs) encoding a fusion protein in which amino acid 387 of MBP is fused to amino acid 759 of the Ssp DnaE N-terminal fragment. Plasmid pETUH4 encodes UCΔH, which consists of the N-terminal sequence MDPSSRS followed by the 107 C-terminal amino acids of theM. tuberculosis RecA intein fused to a 49-amino acid polypeptide with a C-terminal His tag, described earlier (4Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Plasmid pHUΔH encodes H′UΔH, which consists of the N-terminal extein, MHHHHHHPLSG (H′), fused in-frame to the 222-residue RecA mini-intein from plasmid pMUΔ5H (11Shingledecker K. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Gene. 1998; 207: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar),followed by a 49-amino acid polypeptide with a C-terminal His tag (11Shingledecker K. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Gene. 1998; 207: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was derived from pMUΔ5H by replacing the coding sequence for MBP with a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding MHHHHHHPLSG. Plasmid pMUΔ53H differs from pMUΔ5H by mutations that led to the replacement of the Asn-Cys sequence at the C-terminal splice junction by Ala-Ala, yielding the fusion protein MU*ΔH. The intein fusion proteins encoded by these plasmids are represented schematically in Fig.2. Plasmid-encoded proteins were overexpressed in E. coli ER2566 (New England Biolabs). Cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking to a culture density (A600) of about 0.6 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C overnight, except for pHUΔH, which was expressed at 37 °C for 3 h to promote formation of inclusion bodies. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Bis-Tris-Propane, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl) for MU*ΔH, MUNΔ, H′UΔH, and MSNΔ or buffer B (buffer A with 8 m urea) for UCΔH and disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell. The resulting lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 min. For MUNΔ and MSNΔ, the lysate supernatants were passed through 0.5-ml amylose columns (New England Biolabs) that were washed with 15 ml of buffer A and eluted with buffer C (buffer A with 0.5 ml-arginine) supplemented with 10 mm maltose. With H′UΔH, little expressed protein was found in the lysate supernatant, which was therefore discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer B. The fractions containing H′UΔH or UCΔH in buffer B were purified batchwise through Talon spin columns (CLONTECH) that were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer B and twice with 1 ml of buffer B supplemented with 10 mm imidazole and eluted with buffer C supplemented with 8m urea and 100 mm imidazole. For MU*ΔH, to obtain purified precursor protein, the lysate was purified batchwise through a Talon spin column that was washed twice with 1 ml of buffer A and twice with 1 ml of buffer A supplemented with 10 mm imidazole and eluted with buffer A supplemented with 100 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was then passed through a 0.5-ml amylose column, washed with 15 ml of buffer A, and eluted with 1 ml of buffer A supplemented with 10 mm maltose. Protein concentrations were estimated either by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm or by the Bradford method (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized and purified as described (7Lew B.M. Mills K.V. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15887-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The 47-residue peptide SCΔH′′-A35 consists of the 36 residues of theSynechocystis DnaE C-terminal intein, followed by the sequence CFNKSHHHHHH. Peptide SCΔH′′-H35 is identical to SCΔH′′-A35, except that it contains histidine at position 35 instead of alanine. Peptide UC38CA consists of the 38 C-terminal residues of the M. tuberculosis RecA intein followed by the sequence CA. Before use, the peptides were dissolved in buffer A, and their concentrations were estimated on the basis of their cysteine content by the method of Ellman (13Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21473) Google Scholar). Protein splicing and hydroxylamine-induced cleavage mediated intrans by the RecA intein were studied by mixing 30 μm MUNΔ and 60 μmUCΔH in 180 μl of buffer C supplemented with 8m urea or by mixing 20 μm MUNΔand 30 μm UC38CA in 300 μl of buffer C followed by dialysis at 4 °C for sequential 20-min periods against 50 ml each of the following buffers: buffer C supplemented with 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 m urea and no urea followed by overnight dialysis at 4 °C against buffer C. All dialyses were done in the presence of 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and in some cases in the presence of ZnCl2. Protein splicing was allowed to proceed at 25 °C after further addition of 1 mm TCEP and in some cases of 10 mm EDTA or 2.0 mmZnCl2. Hydroxylamine-induced cleavage was studied by incubation at 25 °C with 1 mm TCEP and 0.5 mhydroxylamine, pH 7.0, and, when appropriate, with 10 mmEDTA. Splicing of H′UΔH was studied in a similar manner at a protein concentration of 13 μm, and splicing mediated by the DnaE intein segments was studied using 20 μm MSNΔ and 25 μmSCΔH′′-H35 or SCΔH′′-A35 at 25 °C in the presence of 1 mm TCEP and appropriate concentrations of divalent metal ions or EDTA. Hydroxylamine-induced cleavage of MU*ΔH was studied at a protein concentration of 3 μm by incubation at 25 °C with 1 mm TCEP, 0.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.0, and when appropriate, with 2.0 mm ZnCl2. SDS-PAGE and densitometric analysis by NIH Image 1.60 were performed as described previously (4Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), except that in some cases, 2 mm TCEP was added to the gel-loading buffer in place of 125 mmdl-1,4-dithiothreitol. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager RP Biospectrometry Work station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (7Lew B.M. Mills K.V. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15887-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To prevent splicing during the preparation of the renatured H′UΔH precursor for mass spectroscopy, 10 mm iodoacetamide was added in the presence of 10 mm TCEP, and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then dialyzed against three changes of 30 mm urea. In the search for possible inhibitors of protein splicing, we observed inhibition of protein splicing when ZnCl2 was present during the reconstitution of the RecA intein fragments and the subsequent splicing of the fusion proteins, MUNΔ and UCΔH. The yield of spliced protein (MH) after 16 h at 4 °C in the absence of zinc was 64% but was reduced to 1% in the presence of 2 mm ZnCl2(Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2). The inhibition by ZnCl2 was almost completely reversed by incubation at 25 °C for 2.5 h in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, whereas a similar incubation without EDTA had little effect (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Under similar conditions, 0.2 mm ZnCl2inhibited protein splicing by 90%. In another experiment, the peptide UC38CA, which does not contain a His-tag domain, was used in place of UCΔH in the splicing experiment. In this case, the yield of spliced product (M-Cys-Ala) was 53% after reassociation at 4 °C for 16 h in the absence of zinc ion but only 11% in the presence of 0.2 mm ZnCl2.Figure 4Mass spectrometric analysis of reversible inhibition of cis splicing by zinc ion mediated by a renatured RecA mini-intein. H′UΔH was renatured in the presence of 2.0 mm ZnCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An aliquot was treated with iodoacetamide to prevent protein splicing during processing and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (A); another aliquot was allowed to incubated at 25 °C for 2.5 h with 10 mm EDTA and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (B). The mass numbers of the peaks are indicated in the figure, and the deduced corresponding molecular species are indicated in parentheses. The predicted molecular weights of acetamido-H′UΔH, H′UΔ, and UΔare 30,800, 25,400, and 24,100, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether ZnCl2 also inhibits protein splicing when added after the reassociation of the intein fragments, we reconstituted MUNΔ and UCΔH as above but in the absence of both TCEP and ZnCl2. After reassociation at 4 °C for 16 h, no discernable spliced product was observed. Upon incubation at 25 °C for 2.5 h in the presence of 1 mm TCEP, 48% splicing was observed in the absence of Zn2+ but only 5% in the presence of 2.0 mmZnCl2. To examine the ability of the Zn2+-inhibited intein to catalyze partial reactions such as hydroxylamine-dependent N-terminal cleavage, we reconstituted the trans-splicing components in the presence of 2 mm ZnCl2 and then incubated for 2.5 h at 25 °C with ZnCl2 and 0.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.0. N-terminal cleavage and protein splicing were almost completely suppressed, but the chelation of Zn2+ by the addition of 10 mm EDTA in a parallel incubation restored N-terminal cleavage to 54%, accompanied by 16% splicing (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Generally, cis-protein splicing cannot be studied in vitro on account of extensive splicing of the precursor protein during in vivo expression. However, H′UΔH, a fusion protein in which a 222-residue RecA mini-intein (UΔ) (11Shingledecker K. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Gene. 1998; 207: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was inserted between two His-tagged polypeptides (H′ and H), was expressed in the insoluble fraction as unspliced precursor. After solubilization in 8m urea, purification on a Talon column, and renaturation under reducing conditions, H′UΔH underwent extensive protein splicing. Analysis by SDS-PAGE indicated 73% protein splicing upon renaturation followed by incubation at 25 °C for 2.5 h in the absence of ZnCl2 but no splicing in the presence of 2 mm ZnCl2. Unfortunately, owing to the small size of the exteins, SDS-PAGE could not clearly distinguish between protein splicing and partial reactions such as cleavage at the splice junctions, which would yield products of a similar size. Accordingly, we used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for the definitive identification of the reaction products. Analysis of H′UΔH after renaturation and incubation in the presence of 2 mmZnCl2 followed by treatment with iodoacetamide to prevent protein splicing during sample preparation for mass spectrometry showed primarily a 30.7-kDa component (Fig.4 A), corresponding in mass to the acetamido derivative of the precursor H′UΔH (expectedMr 30.8). When H′UΔH was refolded in the presence of ZnCl2 and then incubated for 2.5 h at 25 °C in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, the 30-kDa component was much reduced and replaced by a 24.0-kDa species (Fig.4 B), whose size was consistent with that of the excised intein, UΔ (expected Mr 24.1). Both samples also contained small amounts of a 25-kDa component, which could be the product of C-terminal cleavage, H′UΔ(expected Mr 25.4). To determine whether zinc ion can exert inhibitory effects on a fully folded intein, we studied the inhibition by zinc of hydroxylamine-dependent N-terminal cleavage of MU*ΔH. MU*ΔH contains U*Δ, an intein in which the second and third steps of protein splicing, transesterification and asparagine cyclization, are blocked by replacing the residues Asn-Cys at the C-terminal splice junction with Ala-Ala. MU*ΔH was purified under native conditions by affinity chromatography (Fig. 5,lane 1) and then incubated with 0.5 mhydroxylamine, pH 7.0, in the presence of 1 mm TCEP alone (Fig. 5, lane 2) or 1 mm TCEP and 2 mm ZnCl2 (Fig. 5, lane 3). In the absence of ZnCl2, hydroxylamine-induced N-terminal cleavage proceeded to 41%, whereas in the presence of ZnCl2, cleavage was only 4%. In contrast to the fragments derived from the M. tuberculosis RecA intein, whose functional reconstitution requires prior denaturation and renaturation, the naturally split DnaE intein from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 reconstitutes without the need for prior unfolding (6Evans T.C. Martin D. Kolly R. Panne D. Sun L. Ghosh I. Chen L. Benner J. Liu X.-Q. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9091-9094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). An interesting aspect of the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 DnaE intein is that the canonical His adjacent to the intein C terminus, which is a potential metal ligand (9Poland B.W. Xu M.-Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), is replaced by Ala (8Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Althoughin vitro protein splicing was previously observed both with the wild-type (Ala-35) C-terminal intein segment (6Evans T.C. Martin D. Kolly R. Panne D. Sun L. Ghosh I. Chen L. Benner J. Liu X.-Q. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9091-9094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and with a mutant (His-35) C-terminal intein segment in which Ala-35 was replaced by His (14Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), these studies were done in very different contexts, and it is therefore not possible to compare the splicing efficacy of the two intein variants. For the direct comparison of their splicing efficiencies, we synthesized both forms of the SynechocystisDnaE C-intein segment fused to the five N-terminal residues of the DnaE C-extein followed by a His tag (SCΔH′′-A35 and SCΔH′′-H35). Using an N-intein segment fused to MBP as the trans-splicing partner (MSNΔ), the extent of protein splicing after 16 h at pH 7.0 and 25 °C was 48% with SCΔH′′-A35 and 46% with SCΔH′′-H35 (Fig. 6), indicating that the penultimate C-intein residue does not play a crucial role in protein splicing involving the DnaE intein. Protein splicing intrans by the DnaE split intein was also strongly inhibited by ZnCl2, with 80% inhibition at 0.2 mmZnCl2 for both SCΔH′′-A35 and SCΔH′′-H35 (Fig. 7). Zn2+ was the most effective of the divalent transition metals ions tested followed by Cd2+, whereas Co2+ and Ni2+ were less inhibitory, and Mg2+ had no significant effect (TableI).Table IEffect divalent metal ions on trans splicing mediated by DnaE intein segmentsCationConcentrationInhibition of protein splicingmm%Zn2+0.272Zn2+2.087Cd2+0.256Cd2+2.071Co2+0.28Co2+2.046Ni2+0.26Ni2+2.035Mg2+0.22Mg2+2.04In the absence of ZnCl2, the extent of protein splicing was 53%. Open table in a new tab In the absence of ZnCl2, the extent of protein splicing was 53%. The reversibility of the effect of Zn2+ on transprotein splicing by the DnaE split intein was examined by incubating the intein segments with 2 mm ZnCl2 for 16.5 h at 25 °C. Under these conditions, protein splicing with the SCΔH′′-A35 and SCΔH′′-H35 C-inteins in this experiment was inhibited 98 and 100%, respectively. Continued incubation at 25 °C for 20 h after the addition of 10 mm EDTA led to a significant level of protein splicing (83 and 94% of the amount expected in the absence of ZnCl2 for SCΔH′′-A35 and SCΔH′′-H35, respectively), indicating almost complete reversal of Zn2+ inhibition. Studies of the action of inhibitors on enzyme-catalyzed reactions have made important contributions to our understanding of enzyme mechanisms. This paper describes the first example of a general, reversible inhibitor of protein splicing. Relatively low concentrations of Zn2+ inhibited protein splicing mediated intrans by reconstituted fragments of the M. tuberculosis RecA intein (Fig. 3) and in cis by a RecA mini-intein (Fig. 4). Low concentrations of Zn2+ also inhibited hydroxylamine-induced N-terminal cleavage mediated incis by a native RecA mutant mini-intein (Fig. 5) and intrans by reconstituted fragments of the RecA intein (Fig.3). In all cases, the entire homing endonuclease domain had been deleted, eliminating it as a possible target for Zn2+inhibition. Inhibition of protein splicing mediated in transby a RecA intein reconstituted with a synthetic peptide lacking a His tag as the C-terminal fragment shows that not more than the 38 C-terminal intein residues are required for Zn2+ inhibition and that a His tag is not required. Inhibition of protein splicing by Zn2+ in a similar concentration range was also observed with the naturally split Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 DnaE intein (Fig. 7, Table I). The inhibition by Zn2+ of protein splicing mediated by two unrelated and quite different inteins suggests that Zn2+ may well be a general inhibitor of protein splicing. The two trans-splicing systems employed for the in vitro study of Zn2+ inhibition were to some extent complementary. The RecA system is a more efficient protein-splicing system and is more versatile in that protein splicing depends less on the presence of adjacent natural extein amino acids than does the DnaE intein (6Evans T.C. Martin D. Kolly R. Panne D. Sun L. Ghosh I. Chen L. Benner J. Liu X.-Q. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9091-9094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, its use is complicated by the need to reconstitute the intein by prior denaturation and renaturation. In this investigation, the RecA intein served as a useful system for comparing the inhibition of protein splicing with the inhibition of its first step, N-terminal cleavage, and for studying the reversibility of Zn2+ inhibition. On the other hand, the DnaE split intein system can be reconstituted without prior denaturation. This attribute greatly facilitated the systematic study of protein-splicing inhibitors such as the response to varying Zn2+ concentrations and the study of metal ion specificity. In addition, the DnaE system provides some insights into the role of the canonical His residue at the penultimate position at the intein C terminus, which has an Ala residue in its place (8Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the extent of protein splicing and the susceptibility to Zn2+ inhibition are similar with Ala or His as the penultimate residue of the DnaE C-intein (Figs. 6 and 7). The inhibition by Zn2+ occurred at relatively low concentrations. Both the cis- and trans-splicing systems using the RecA intein were essentially completely inhibited by 2 mm ZnCl2 (Figs. 3 and 4), and thetrans-splicing system was essentially completely inhibited by 200 μm ZnCl2 as well (cissplicing was not studied at lower Zn2+ concentrations). The range of Zn2+ concentrations that affected protein splicingin vitro is similar to the concentration range in which Zn2+ modulates the activity of some E. colienzymes, such as succinate oxidase (15Kasahara M. Anraku Y. J. Biochem. 1974; 76: 967-976PubMed Google Scholar), aminolevulinate dehydratase (16Spencer P. Jordan P.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the YyrR phosphatase (17Zhao S. Zhu Q. Somerville R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It should be noted that all studies reported in this paper were carried out with TCEP rather thandl-1,4-dithiothreitol as the thiol reductant, thereby avoiding complications caused by the binding of Zn2+ to the added thiol. The specificity of metal ion inhibition was studied in the DnaEtrans-splicing system. Zn2+ was a significantly more potent inhibitor than other divalent transition metal ions (TableI). The presence of 2 mm ZnCl2 inhibited protein splicing by almost 90%. Cadmium ion was only slightly less effective an inhibitor as Zn2+, which is not surprising considering that cadmium has been shown to substitute functionally for zinc in other enzymes, such as carboxypeptidase (18Coleman J.E. Vallee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and β-lactamase (19Paul-Soto R. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Carfi A. Dideberg O. Wouters J. Hemmingsen L. Bauer R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16500-16605Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The only nontransition metal studied, Mg2+, had no significant effect on protein splicing. The absence of an effect of Mg2+ and the fact that protein splicing occurs effectivelyin vitro with intein components routinely refolded using buffers supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (4Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Lew B.M. Mills K.V. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15887-15890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that divalent metal ions do not play an essential role as cofactors in the protein-splicing reaction or as structural components of inteins. It is therefore unlikely that the inhibition by Zn2+ involves competition with a natural divalent metal ion cofactor or prosthetic group. The RecA intein was used to study the mode of zinc inhibition. Splicing was essentially completely inhibited by 2 mmZnCl2, and this inhibition was fully reversible upon the addition of 10 mm EDTA for 2.5 h at 25 °C (Fig. 3). If inhibition by Zn2+ involved the replacement of a tightly bound, essential metal ion, the addition of EDTA in the absence of the essential metal would not be able to effect its reversal. The first step of protein splicing, which can be assayed independently of subsequent steps by measuring the hydroxylamine-dependent N-terminal cleavage reaction (20Shao Y. Xu M.-Q. Paulus H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Shingledecker K. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), was also completely inhibited by 2 mm Zn2+ in an EDTA-reversible manner in thetrans-splicing system (Fig. 3). The initial step in protein splicing can also be studied in a cis-splicing system by using a mutant intein in which the Asn and Cys residues flanking the C-terminal splice junction, which are essential for steps 3 and 2 of protein splicing (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), have been replaced by Ala residues. Using such a mutant intein, the hydroxylamine-dependent reaction was more than 90% inhibited by 2 mm ZnCl2 (Fig. 5). These observations indicate that Zn2+ is a reversible inhibitor of protein splicing as well as of the initial N-S acyl rearrangement, the first step in protein splicing. Since protein splicing in trans also requires prior reconstitution of the intein segments, one could argue that Zn2+ interferes with the reassociation process rather than with protein splicing per se. At least two lines of evidence support the notion that Zn2+ inhibits protein splicing directly. (i) Protein splicing in trans can be measured independently from reassociation by carrying out reconstitution in the absence of a thiol reductant, which leads to the formation of a disulfide-linked dimer that can undergo splicing in the presence of TCEP (4Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The observation that subsequent TCEP-dependent protein splicing was inhibited by Zn2+ implies that the metal ion does not need to be present during intein refolding and assembly to exert its inhibitory effect. (ii) Unspliced precursor proteins involving the RecA intein, in which the second and third steps of the protein-splicing process, i.e. transesterification and Asn cyclization (see Fig. 4 of Ref. 1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), are blocked owing to mutation of the amino acid residues flanking the C-terminal splice junction, can be isolated in the native state and used to study the first step of protein splicing in terms of hydroxylamine-dependent cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction (21Shingledecker K. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The observation that hydroxylamine-dependent cleavage of a fully folded mutant intein is inhibited by Zn2+ (Fig. 5) demonstrates that the metal ion directly interferes with the first step of protein splicing. A recent crystallographic analysis of the VMA intein of S. cerevisiae revealed a zinc ion chelated by the Cys at the C-terminal splice junction, the His residue adjacent to the intein C terminus, the Glu at position 80 in domain B, and a solvent water molecule (9Poland B.W. Xu M.-Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The relationship of this Zn2+ complex to the inhibition of protein splicing by Zn2+ described in this paper is not clear. It is worth noting that the effect of Zn2+ on protein splicing mediated by the DnaE intein segments was not significantly affected by the absence or presence of His adjacent to the intein C terminus (Fig. 7). Also, the inhibition by Zn2+ of the first step of protein splicing occurred in a RecA intein in which the Asn and Cys residues at the C-terminal splice junction were replaced by Ala. These observations suggest that the modes of Zn2+ binding that exert inhibitory effects of Zn2+ on the DnaE and the RecA inteins may not be the same as the mode of binding described by Poland et. al. (9Poland B.W. Xu M.-Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The results presented in this paper constitute the first description of an inhibitor of protein splicing. The inhibition of protein splicing by Zn2+ may be a relatively general phenomenon, as it is observed with two quite different inteins regardless of whether protein splicing occurred in cis or trans. The complete reversibility of this potent inhibition should make it a valuable tool in biochemical and biophysical studies of the mechanism of protein splicing. For example, it may allow the crystallization of protein-splicing precursors without the need for mutations to prevent splicing. The modulation of protein splicing by metal ions at concentrations only in slight molar excess over the intein concentration suggests the possibility that metal ions also could affect protein splicing in vivo and perhaps might even serve as a physiological mechanism to regulate protein splicing in certain organisms.

Heterodimerization is essential for Ku-dependent DNA repairin vivo, although its role is poorly understood. Some lines of evidence suggest that heterodimerization is required for the stabilization of Ku70 and Ku80. Here we show that the heterodimerization of these Ku subunits is important for their nuclear entry. When transfected into Ku-deficient xrs-6 cells, exogenous Ku70 and Ku80 tagged with green fluorescent protein accumulated into the nucleus, whereas each nuclear localization signal (NLS)-dysfunctional mutant was undetectable in the nucleus, supporting the idea that each Ku can translocate to the nucleus through its own NLS. On the other hand, the nuclear accumulation of each NLS-dysfunctional mutant was markedly enhanced by the presence of an exogenous wild-type counterpart. In Ku-expressing HeLa cells, each NLS-dysfunctional mutant, as well as wild-type Ku70 and Ku80, was still detectable in the nucleus, whereas the double mutant of each Ku subunit with decreased functions of both nuclear targeting and dimerization was undetectable in the nucleus.

It was shown that Ku is the DNA-binding component of a DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)1 that phosphorylates several nuclear proteins in vitro,e.g. p53, RNA polymerase II, or Ku itself and is involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and V(D)J recombination (2Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 3Weaver D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 29-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Besides this main function, the Ku protein has other functions, some of which may be independent of DNA-PK activity. Both Ku70- and Ku80-knockout mice exhibited not only deficiencies in DNA DSB repair but also growth retardation (4Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C.

In addition, Ku70- and Ku80-mutant embryo fibroblasts in primary cultures have prolonged doubling times compared with normal embryo fibroblasts due to the rapid loss of proliferating cells and have shown signs of senescence (4Nussenzweig A.

Davidson L. Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 367-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Ku plays some role in growth regulation and/or senescence independent of the function of DNA-PK.Ku has been generally believed to always exist and function as a heterodimer. The heterodimerization is essential for DNA DSB repairin vivo and is also important in activating DNA-PK, which is one of the main functions of Ku (7Jin S. Weaver D.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6874-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The interacting regions of Ku70 and Ku80 have been identified by many research groups (8Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell.

Loss of one of the Ku subunits results in a significant decrease in the steady-state level of the other (5Gu Y. Seidl K.J. Rathbun G.A. Zhu C. Manis J.P. van der Stoep N. Davidson L. Cheng H.L.

On the other hand, there are some differences in the phenotype between Ku70- and Ku80-knockout mice (4Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C.

For example, Ku70-knockout mice have small populations of mature T lymphocytes and a significant incidence of thymic lymphoma, but Ku80-knockout mice do not. Ku70 has been reported to show Ku80-dependent and -independent DNA binding, whereas Ku80 requires association with Ku70 for DNA binding (12Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, Ku70 may have unique functions that are independent of Ku80.Ku was originally reported to be a nuclear protein, consistent with its functions as a subunit of DNA-PK. On the other hand, although Ku is thought to be localized and to function only in the nucleus, several studies have revealed the cytoplasmic or cell surface localization of Ku proteins in various cell types (18Prabhakar B.S. Allaway G.P. Srinivasappa J. Notkins A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1301-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Danziel R.G. Mendelson S.C. Quinn J.P.

Riwar B. Jessberger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of Ku70 and Ku80 changes during the cell cycle (22Koike M. Awaji T. Kataoka M. Tsujimoto G. Kartasova T. Koike A. Shiomi T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4031-4039PubMed Google Scholar), and the nuclear translocation of Ku70 precedes that of Ku80 in late telophase/early G1 cells (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in the subcellular localization of Ku could be controlled by various external growth-regulating stimuli (24Fewell J. Kuff E.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1937-1946PubMed Google Scholar). CD40L treatment of the myeloma cells induces a translocation of Ku from the cytoplasm to the cell surface, and that cell surface Ku can mediate both homotypic and heterotypic adhesion (25Teoh G. Urashima M. Greenfield E.A. Nguyen K.A. Lee J.F. Chauhan D. Ogata A. Treon S.P. Anderson K.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Morio et al. (26Morio T. Hanissian S.H. Bacharier L.B. Teraoka H. Nonoyama S. Seki M. Kondo J. Nakano H. Lee S.K. Geha R.S. Yata J. Immunity. 1999; 11: 339-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have reported that DNA-PK activity of human B cells is, at least in part, regulated by the nuclear translocation of Ku. These data suggest that the control mechanism for subcellular localization of Ku70 and Ku80 plays, at least in part, a key role in regulating the physiological function of Kuin vivo, although the mechanism is poorly understood.We have recently identified nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of Ku70 and Ku80 (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structures of the NLSs of the two Ku protein subunits are different. NLSs of Ku80 and Ku70 belong to the single-basic type and the variant bipartite-basic type, respectively (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have also shown that both Ku70 and Ku80 can translocate to the nucleus without forming a heterodimer using their own NLS (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Koike M. Shiomi T. Koike A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subcellular localization of Ku70 is affected by somatostatin treatment in CV-1 cells, but that of Ku80 is not (24Fewell J. Kuff E.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1937-1946PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the nuclear translocation of Ku70 and Ku80 may be independently regulated.In the present study, we examined the subcellular localization of chimeric constructs of green fluorescent protein (GFP) color variants, and Ku proteins to which mutations were introduced by the site-directed mutagenesis technique, and found that Ku70 and Ku80 translocate to the nucleus not only through their own NLS but also through the heterodimerization, suggesting that the heterodimerization of Ku is important for their nuclear entry and functional regulation.DISCUSSIONIn general, it is known that nuclear proteins containing an intrinsic NLS enter the nucleus associated with NLS receptors (e.g. importin α/β) through their own NLSs (32Nigg E. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). We had previously reported that Ku70 and Ku80 have an intrinsic NLS and that the NLS receptor can recognize the NLSs of Ku70 and Ku80 (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further examined the molecular basis of the regulation of Ku70 and Ku80 subcellular localization using site-directed mutagenesis. In agreement with our previous observations, we have found that each Ku subunit can translocate to the nucleus through its own NLS (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Koike M. Shiomi T. Koike A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our data have shown that each Ku subunit can also translocate to the nucleus independent of its own NLS and that this translocation is dependent on its interaction with the other subunit.Ku has been generally considered to always form and function as a heterodimer. In studies using knockout mice, however, inactivation of Ku70 resulted in some phenotype distinct from that of Ku80-knockout mice (4Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 5Gu Y. Seidl K.J. Rathbun G.A. Zhu C. Manis J.P. van der Stoep N. Davidson L. Cheng H.L. Sekiguchi J.M.

Cell. 1996; 86: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that Ku70 and Ku80 have unique functions that are independent of each other. Recently, we identified the NLSs of human Ku70 (amino acids 539–556) and Ku80 (amino acids 561–569) (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, the EGFP-Ku80 fusion protein accumulated within the nuclei of xrs-6 cells (Fig.2 F, panel a). Furthermore, the NLS-dysfunctional mutant (EGFP-Ku80(1–732, K565A/K566A/K568A) or EGFP-Ku80(1–732, P562A/K565A/K566A)) lost its nuclear localization activity in thexrs-6 cells (Fig. 2 F, panels d and e), indicating that Ku80 contains a classical NLS and that this NLS is functional. In this and previous reports, we also showed that the EGFP-Ku70 fusion protein accumulated within the nuclei ofxrs-6 cells (Fig. 2 E, panel a) (28Koike M. Shiomi T. Koike A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the NLS-dysfunctional mutant, EGFP-Ku70(1–609, K542A/R543A/K553A), lost its nuclear localization activity in thexrs-6 cells (Fig. 2 E, panel g). These findings support the idea that both Ku70 and Ku80 can translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus without forming a heterodimer using their own NLS. Irradiation resulted in an up-regulation of the cellular level of Ku70, but not that of Ku80, and Ku70 accumulated within the nucleus (33Brown K.D. Lataxes T.A. Shangary S. Mannino J.L. Giardina J.F. Chen J. Baskaran R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6651-6656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subcellular localization of Ku70 was affected by somatostatin treatment in CV-1 cells, but that of Ku80 was not (24Fewell J. Kuff E.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1937-1946PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the nuclear translocation of Ku70 preceded that of Ku80 at the late telophase/early G1 phase during the cell cycle (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Each Ku subunit may have a functional NLS to perform unique functions, which are independent of each other, although further studies will be necessary to confirm this. As described above, nuclear translocation of Ku70 and Ku80 can be independently regulated in vivo. The structures of NLSs of both Ku protein subunits are quite different, and NLSs of Ku80 and Ku70 are of the single-basic type and the variant bipartite-basic type, respectively (23Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7495-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Koike M. Ikuta T. Miyasaka T. Shiomi T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that the nuclear translocation of Ku proteins is controlled at least in part at the NLS recognition step and that this is regulated by NLS receptors with various specificities in vivo.We have also found that the heterodimerization between Ku70 and Ku80 plays an important role in their nuclear translocation. When two NLS-dysfunctional Ku80 mutants were transfected into HeLa cells, both EGFP-Ku80(P562A/K565A/K566A) and EGFP-Ku80(K565A/K566A/K568A) translocated to the nucleus (Fig. 3 B, panels d ande). However, EGFP-Ku80(A453H/V454H/K565A/K566A/K568A), which was a double mutant lacking both nuclear targeting and dimerization functions, did not translocate to the nucleus (Fig. 5 d). These results suggest that endogenous Ku70 transports the NLS-dysfunctional Ku80 mutants into the nucleus in HeLa cells. In cotransfection analysis using xrs-6 cells, the Ku80 mutant lacking only the nuclear targeting function was localized in the nucleus by the exogenous wild-type Ku70 (Fig. 6, e ande′). In addition, when the same Ku80 mutant and NLS-dysfunctional Ku70 mutant (ECFP-Ku70(1–609, K542A/R543A/K553A) were coexpressed, EYFP-Ku80(1–732, K565A/K566A/K568A) did not accumulate within the nucleus (Fig. 6, d and d′). These results indicate that Ku70 transport Ku80 into the nucleus via its own NLS in xrs-6 cells. In this manner, one role of Ku70 may be to regulate the nuclear translocation of Ku80. On the other hand, the NLS-dysfunctional Ku70 mutant, but not the double mutant lacking both nuclear targeting and dimerization functions, was localized into the nucleus due to the presence of exogenous wild-type Ku80 (Fig. 6, b, b′, c, and c′). When the same Ku70 mutant and NLS-dysfunctional Ku80 mutant (EYFP-Ku80(1–732, K565A/K566A/K568A) were coexpressed, ECFP-Ku70(1–609, K542A/R543A/K553A) did not accumulate within the nucleus (Fig. 6,d and d′). These results indicate that Ku80 can transport Ku70 into the nucleus via its own NLS in xrs-6cells. However, the NLS-dysfunctional Ku70 mutant, which can still interact with Ku80, did not completely localize to the nucleus despite the presence of endogenous Ku80 in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 A, panels d and e). The half-life of the Ku80 monomeric form is less than 2 h (34Satoh M. Wang J. Reeves W.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar), whereas that of the EGFP-tagged protein was more than 24 h (17Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5451) Google Scholar). Although the discrepancy between the results in HeLa and in xrs-6 cells remains unclear, this may be due to the differences in half-life between endogenous Ku80 in HeLa cells and exogenous EGFP-tagged Ku80 in xrs-6 cells. Alternatively, in HeLa cells, the Ku70 localization may be dependent not only on the nuclear import mechanism but also on the nuclear export mechanism. Further studies will be necessary to confirm that Ku80 transport Ku70 into the nucleus in vivo.Ku70 and Ku80 play an important role in DNA DSB repair and V(D)J recombination in vivo (4Nussenzweig A.

Weaver D.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6874-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but the role of this interaction in Ku functions remains unknown. It is also reported that the heterodimerization is required for the stabilization of each Ku subunit (5Gu Y. Seidl K.J. Rathbun G.A. Zhu C. Manis J.P. van der Stoep N. Davidson L. Cheng H.L.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 339-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that the DNA-PK activity of human B cells is, at least in part, regulated by the nuclear translocation of Ku. Recently, we have generated cell lines stably expressing the wild-type Ku80 (EGFP-Ku80) or NLS-dysfunctional Ku80 mutant tagged with EGFP (EGFP-Ku80(K565A/K566A/K568A)). We have found that the tagged wild-type Ku80 protein can complement a deficiency of the DNA DSB repair ofxrs-6 cells (data not shown). In contrast, the tagged NLS-dysfunctional Ku80 mutant protein cannot complement a deficiency of the DNA DSB repair of xrs-6 cells, although the Ku80 mutant protein is stabilized by tagged with EGFP (data not shown).In conclusion, we have shown a novel role of the heterodimerization of Ku70 and Ku80. Ku70 and Ku80 appear to have multiple functions as a monomeric form and a heterodimeric form. We speculate that the Ku subunits may use the NLS-dependent nuclear translocation pathway to perform some function(s) independent of each other, and Ku subunits may use the nuclear translocation pathway through hetrerodimerization to perform the same functions dependent on each other. The control mechanism for nuclear localization of Ku70 and Ku80 appear to play, at least in part, a key role in regulating the physiological function of Ku in vivo. Further studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of nuclear transport of the Ku subunits will lead to a better understanding of the regulation mechanism of nuclear proteins. Ku is a complex composed of two protein subunits of 70 and 80 kDa, hereafter designated as Ku70 and Ku80, respectively (1Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2274-2278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that Ku is the DNA-binding component of a DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)1 that phosphorylates several nuclear proteins in vitro,e.g. p53, RNA polymerase II, or Ku itself and is involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and V(D)J recombination (2Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 3Weaver D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 29-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Besides this main function, the Ku protein has other functions, some of which may be independent of DNA-PK activity. Both Ku70- and Ku80-knockout mice exhibited not only deficiencies in DNA DSB repair but also growth retardation (4Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C.

In addition, Ku70- and Ku80-mutant embryo fibroblasts in primary cultures have prolonged doubling times compared with normal embryo fibroblasts due to the rapid loss of proliferating cells and have shown signs of senescence (4Nussenzweig A.

These findings suggest that Ku plays some role in growth regulation and/or senescence independent of the function of DNA-PK. Ku has been generally believed to always exist and function as a heterodimer. The heterodimerization is essential for DNA DSB repairin vivo and is also important in activating DNA-PK, which is one of the main functions of Ku (7Jin S. Weaver D.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6874-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The interacting regions of Ku70 and Ku80 have been identified by many research groups (8Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1964579111,"An NADPH oxidase is thought to function in microglial cells of the central nervous system. These conclusions are based on pharmacological and immunochemical evidence, although these approaches are indirect and raise issues of specificity. For example, diphenyleneiodonium inhibits a variety of flavoenzymes, including xanthine oxidase, NADH dehydrogenase, and NADPH oxidase. Here, we provide genetic evidence that p47phox, an essential component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, is required for superoxide anion release from microglia. Microglia derived from newborn wild-type mice, but not from newborn p47phox-deficient (knockout; -/-) mice, produced superoxide after stimulation by opsonized zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate. Endogenous p47phox was detected only in wild-type microglia, consistent with selective superoxide production in these cells. Superoxide release was restored in p47phox-deficient microglia that were retrovirally transduced with human p47phox cDNA. Similar kinetics of superoxide generation were observed, consistent with the same enzyme functioning in wild-type and restored microglia. Immuno-detection of p47phox in transduced cells confirmed that restoration of superoxide release correlated with production of recombinant protein. These data provide genetic proof that p47phox is necessary for superoxide release by microglial cells and indicate that a system related to the phagocyte oxidase is active in these cells."

This unusual reaction is an essential human metabolic function, with loss of FAH activity causing the fatal metabolic disease hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1). An enzymatic mechanism involving a catalytic metal ion, a Glu/His catalytic dyad, and a charged oxyanion hole was previously proposed based on recently determined FAH crystal structures. Here we report the development and characterization of an FAH inhibitor, 4-(hydroxymethylphosphinoyl)-3-oxo-butanoic acid (HMPOBA), that competes with the physiological substrate with a<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of 85 μm. The crystal structure of FAH complexed with HMPOBA refined at 1.3-Å resolution reveals the molecular basis for the competitive inhibition, supports the proposed formation of a tetrahedral alkoxy transition state intermediate during the FAH catalyzed reaction, and reveals a Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound in the enzyme's active site. The analysis of FAH structures corresponding to different catalytic states reveals significant active site side-chain motions that may also be related to catalytic function. Thus, these results advance the understanding of an essential catabolic reaction associated with a fatal metabolic disease and provide insight into the structure-based development of FAH inhibitors."

A randomly mutagenized pex5 library was screened in a two-hybrid setup for mutations that disrupted the interaction with the PTS1 protein Mdh3p or for suppressor mutations that could restore the interaction with Mdh3p containing a mutation in its PTS1. All mutations localized in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of Pex5p. The Pex5p TPR domain was modeled based on the crystal structure of a related TPR protein. Mapping of the mutations on this structural model revealed that some of the loss-of-interaction mutations consisted of substitutions in α-helices of TPRs with bulky amino acids, probably resulting in local misfolding and thereby indirectly preventing binding of PTS1 proteins. The other loss-of-interaction mutations and most suppressor mutations localized in short, exposed, intra-repeat loops of TPR2, TPR3, and TPR6, which are predicted to mediate direct interaction with PTS1 amino acids.

Most peroxisomal matrix proteins contain a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1)1 consisting of three amino acids at the extreme carboxyl terminus.

Deletion studies have shown that the seven (or eight, depending on the organism) tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) in the C-terminal part of Pex5p are important and also sufficient for the binding of PTS1 proteins (27Brocard C.

A library of pex5 mutants was created by random mutagenesis ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae PEX5. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to select pex5 mutants that had lost the capacity to bind the PTS1-containing protein Mdh3p (malatedehydrogenase-3protein) from S. cerevisiae. In a separate screen, pex5 mutants were selected that had gained interaction with a mutant PTS1 protein (Mdh3-SEL). We also derived a structural model for the TPR motifs of Pex5p based on the crystal structure of the three TPR motifs in protein phosphatase-5 (PP5) (29Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). By relating the mutations found in Pex5p to this structural model, we were able to explain why certain mutations affected the interaction with Mdh3p. On the basis of orthologous sequence alignments, additional mutations were made in strongly conserved amino acids in Pex5p by site-directed mutagenesis. The selected mutants, together with the structural model, allowed us to put forward a proposal as to how PTS1-containing proteins are selected by Pex5p. The yeast strains used in this study were S. cerevisiae BJ1991 (MATα , leu2, trp1, ura3-251, prb1-1122, pep4-3, gal2), BJ1991pex5Δ (MATα ,pex5::LEU2, leu2, trp1, ura3-251, prb1-1122, pep4-3, gal2), HF7c (MAT a, ura352, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1UAS -GAl1TATA -HIS3, URA3::GAL417-mers(×3) -CyC1TATA -lacZ), and PCY2 (MATα , Δgal4, Δgal80, URA3::GAL1-lacZ, lys2-801, his3-Δ200, trp1-Δ63, leu2, ade2-101). The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (recA, hsdR, supE, endA, gyrA96, thi-1, relA1, lacZ) was used for all transformations and plasmid isolations. Yeast transformations were carried out as described (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, and amino acids as needed. Standard techniques for DNA manipulations were used (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The construct pAN1 was made by cloning the complete open reading frame of PEX5 betweenEcoRI and HindIII in the multiple cloning site of pUC19. Some restriction sites in the multiple cloning site were deleted, and some additional sites were introduced: EcoRI and BamHI at the 5′-end of PEX5 andPstI, SphI, SpeI, SphI, andHindIII at the 3′-end of PEX5. Two additional restriction sites were introduced in PEX5 by silent mutations: a XbaI site at position 1140 by mutating the codon for leucine 381 from CTG to CTA and a SalI site at position 1356 by mutating the codon for leucine 452 from TTA to TTG and the codon for serine 453 from AGC to TCG. The plasmid encoding the Gal4 activation domain fusion with PEX5 (pAN4) was constructed by cloning PEX5 from pAN1EcoRI-SpeI in the two-hybrid vector pPC86 (32Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The plasmid encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion with GFP-SKL (pAN25) was constructed by PCR on GFP containing the S65T mutation with primers p330 and p331. The PCR product was cloned intoEcoRI-PstI in pAN1, resulting in pAN21. Subsequently, the two complementary oligonucleotides p332 and p333 were ligated between the PstI and SpeI sites of pAN21, resulting in pAN22. The insert from pAN22 was cloned intoSalI-SpeI in the multiple cloning site of the two-hybrid vector pPC97 (32Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusions with the Pex13p SH3 domain (pGB17) and Pex14p (pGB47) have been described before (19Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T.J. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A GST fusion with the Pex5p-N393A mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis (see below). A maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion with Mdh3p (pAN60) was made by digestion of pEL102 with BamHI and cloning the fragment into pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs Inc.). An MBP fusion with Mdh3ΔSKL (pAN56) was made by PCR on pEL102 with primers p325 and p326. The PCR product was cloned intoBamHI-HindIII in pMal-c2. The oligonucleotides used were p325 (AAGGATCCATGGTCAAAGTCGCAATTCTTG), p326 (AAAAAGCTTCAAGAGTCTAGGATGAAACTCTTG), p330 (CGGAATTCTGTCGACTGGATCCATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC), p331 (CCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCATGTG), p332 (GGGTGGTGGTTCCAAGCTATGA), and p333 (CTAGTCATAGCTTGGAACCACCACCCTGCA). ThePEX5 gene spanning 1839 base pairs was randomly mutagenized by error-prone PCR. We used Taq DNA polymerase lacking the 3′ → 5′ proofreading activity (35Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. PCR Methods Applications. 1991; 1: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). pAN1 was used as a template under standard reaction conditions (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dNTPs, and 0.03 units/μl Taq polymerase) (36Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using the M13/pUC primers (6 ng/μl) 1224 and 1233 (New England Biolabs Inc.). The mutation frequency was determined by sequencing 23 randomly pickedpex5 clones at 1.8 × 10−3 per nucleotide synthesized, resulting in 3.3 mutations per pex5clone synthesized. The mutagenized pex5 was split into two parts using the XbaI site at position 1140. In this way, two sublibraries of pex5 mutants were made (see Fig. 1). The C-mutant pex5 library was made by replacing the 3′-XbaI-PstI fragment of the wild-typePEX5 sequence (nucleotides 1141–1839) in plasmid pAN1 with the corresponding mutagenized pex5 sequence. This mutagenized region of PEX5 includes the motifs TPR3–7 (amino acids 381–612). The N-mutant pex5 library was made from the same PCR product as the C-mutant pex5 library by replacing the 5′-BamHI-XbaI fragment of the wild-type PEX5 region (nucleotides 1–1140) in plasmid pAN1 with the corresponding mutagenized pex5 sequence. This includes the motifs TPR1 and TPR2. For screening in the two-hybrid system (37Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4837) Google Scholar), both libraries were subcloned in plasmid pPC86 (usingEcoRI-SpeI), leading to a fusion of thepex5 mutants with the Gal4 transcription activation domain. For in vivo complementation studies, both libraries were subcloned (BamHI-PstI) behind the PEX5promoter in plasmid pEL91. Yeast strain HF7c expressing pDBMDH3 was transformed with the C-mutant pex5 library fused to the Gal4 transcription activation domain; 20,000 double transformants were selected on 2% glucose/leu− trp− plates. These transformants were replica-plated onto 2% glucose/leu− trp− his− plates containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) to test for the interaction between the PTS1 protein Mdh3p and the pex5mutant library. About 300 transformants (1.5%) were selected that were not able to grow on plates without histidine. Total protein was isolated from 72 of the 300 transformants for Western blotting using anti-Pex5p antibodies; 28 of the 72 transformants expressed a full-length Gal4 transcription activation domain-Pex5p fusion. The 28 plasmids coding for full-length Pex5p were rescued and retransformed to HF7c for two-hybrid analysis. Nine of the 28 mutants displayed interaction with Mdh3p, indicating a first-round false-negative mutant. The remaining 19 clones were sequenced to determine the sites of the mutations. Five mutants contained more than two amino acid substitutions and were not further analyzed. The N-mutant pex5 library was screened for loss of interaction with Mdh3p in the same way as described for the C-mutantpex5 library. The percentage of mutants that could not grow was much larger for the N-mutant pex5 library than for the C-mutant pex5 library. Of the 3000 transformants, 100 were not able to grow. However, only 8 of the 100 selected mutants produced the full-length fusion protein, and from these mutants, the plasmid was rescued. After retransformation, only one of these mutants (pex5.42) still showed no interaction with Mdh3p. Yeast strain HF7c expressing pDBMDH3-SEL was transformed with either the C-mutant or N-mutantpex5 library, and in each case, 100,000 transformants were made and plated onto 2% glucose/leu− trp−his− plates containing 25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Transformants that were able to grow on these plates and thus contained pex5 mutants that had gained an interaction with Mdh3-SEL were selected. One pex5 suppressor mutant (pex5.sup2) was isolated from the N-mutantpex5 library, and three pex5 suppressor mutants (pex5.sup1, pex5.sup3, and pex5.sup21) were isolated from the C-mutant pex5 library. These mutants were sequenced to determine the sites of the mutations. The GST and MBP fusion proteins were expressed and isolated as described elsewhere (19Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T.J. Kragt A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6382-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For thein vitro binding experiments, 250 μl of cleared lysate containing the MBP fusion protein was first bound to an amylose resin column; and subsequently, the purified GST fusion protein (100 μg) was passed over the column. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with maltose and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fusion proteins used in these experiments were MBP-Mdh3p, MBP-Mdh3ΔSKL, GST-Pex5p, and GST-Pex5p-N393A. The small amino acids at positions 8, 10, and 27 of the TPR motifs of Pex5p were aligned with the small amino acids of the PP5 TPR motifs. By using this optimized alignment, it was possible to model the Pex5p TPR domain based on the PP5 TPR crystal structure (29Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). For the modeling procedure, the Pex5p TPR domain region was split into two parts, TPR1–3 and TPR5–7, thus excluding TPR4. Alignments and initial optimized template PP5 and model Pex5p overlays were generated using the Swiss-PdbViewer/SWISS-MODEL interface (38Guex N. Diemand A. Peitsch C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent models were checked, refined, and energy-minimized using WHAT IF (39Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 526-529Google Scholar) and the Biotech Validation Suite in combination with the Swiss-PdbViewer. Models show backbone root mean square deviations from the PP5 template of 0.4–0.8 Å. The final total energies were −4600 kJ/mol for TPR1–3 and −5900 kJ/mol for TPR5–7. Site-directed mutations were introduced with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pAN4 as a template. The oligonucleotides used were N325A (GCTGCCTACTGATGGAAGCCGGAGCCAAATTGAGCG), N360A (GGTCTAGTACAAACCCAGGCTGAAAAAGAGTTGAACGGC), E363A (CCCAGAATGAAAAAGCGTTGAACGGCATAAGCGC), I389D (GAGGCAATGAAAACTTTAGCGGACAGTTATATAAACGAAGG), N393A (CTTTAGCGATAAGTTATATAGCCGAAGGTTATGATATGAGCGCC), N393G (CTTTAGCGATAAGTTATATAGGCGAAGGTTATGATATGAGCGCC), E394A (GCGATAAGTTATATAAACGCAGGTTATGATATGAGCGCC), N503A (GGGGCTTCATTGGCCGCTTCCAATAGATCAGAGG), S504A (GCTTCATTGGCCAATGCCAATAGATCAGAGGAAGC), N505A (GGCTTCATTGGCCAATTCCGCTAGATCAGAGGAAGC), L531A (GTTAGAGCTCGCTATAATGCGGCGGTATCATCCATGAATATAGGC), and N537A (GGCGGTATCATCCATGGCTATAGGCTGTTTCAAAGAAGC). The mutations that were introduced using these primers are underlined. For each primer listed, also the complementary primer was used. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described (40Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

To investigate which parts of Pex5p are responsible for contacting PTS1-containing proteins, mutations were introduced randomly into theS. cerevisiae PEX5 gene by PCR amplification (see “Experimental Procedures”). For technical reasons, the mutant library was divided into two halves (Fig.1). The N-terminal part of the mutant library was linked to the wild-type C-terminal part, and the C-terminal part of the mutant library was linked to the wild-type N-terminal part. Both libraries were used for a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen to select mutants that had lost the capacity to interact with yeast Mdh3p, a PTS1 (SKL)-containing peroxisomal matrix protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each of the selected mutants was analyzed by Western blotting to determine whether full-length Pex5p was still produced at normal levels. From the C-mutant pex5 library, 14 pex5 mutants were selected, whereas from the N-mutant pex5 library, only one mutant (pex5.42) was selected that expressed full-length Pex5p. (Table I). These numbers confirm previous results that the C-terminal TPR domain is responsible for PTS1 recognition (11Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat.

The pex5mutants, when expressed in vivo under the control of thePEX5 promoter, were unable to complement the oleate non-utilizer (onu) phenotype of a pex5Δ strain, indicating that they had also lost their function in vivo(data not shown). The sites of the mutations in these pex5mutants were determined, and we found that for every mutant, there was at least one mutation located in a TPR motif (Table I). This indicated that these motifs are important for the interaction with PTS1 proteins,i.e. in TPR2, TPR3, and TPR5–7. No mutations were found in TPR1 and TPR4, suggesting that these motifs do not contribute to PTS1 interaction. One residue, asparagine 393 in TPR3, was found to be mutated in five different clones (pex5.38,pex5.45, pex5.46, pex5.70, andpex5.97), suggesting an important role for this residue in PTS1 recognition. Previous studies of Pex5 proteins in different species have shown that the interaction between Pex5p and PTS1-containing proteins is direct (10Wiemer E.A. Nuttley W.M. Bertolaet B.L. Li X. Francke U.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3627-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction between S. cerevisiae Pex5p and Mdh3p is direct and dependent on PTS1, an in vitro binding assay was carried out. The genes encoding Pex5p and Mdh3p were fused in frame to DNA sequences encoding GST and MBP, respectively, and the chimeric genes were expressed in E. coli. As a control, mutant Mdh3p lacking its PTS1 (Mdh3ΔSKL) was fused to MBP and expressed inE. coli. GST-Pex5p was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column, and the purified fusion protein was tested for its ability to bind to a column with immobilized MBP-Mdh3p and MBP-Mdh3ΔSKL, respectively. Fig. 2 shows that GST-Pex5p interacted with MBP-Mdh3p, but not with MBP-Mdh3ΔSKL. Furthermore, GST alone was not retained on the MBP-Mdh3p column (data not shown). These data indicate that the interaction between Pex5p and Mdh3p is direct and is dependent on PTS1 of the latter protein. To determine whether asparagine 393, found to be mutated in five different clones, is also important for direct interaction with Mdh3p, an in vitro binding experiment was performed with the Pex5p-N393D mutant. GST-Pex5p-N393D did not interact with Mdh3p because it was not retained on a column with immobilized MBP-Mdh3p. These data underscore the important role of asparagine 393 in TPR3 of Pex5p for PTS1 interaction. To identify additional residues in Pex5p involved in PTS1 recognition, we carried out a positive two-hybrid screen. Instead of screening for pex5mutants that had lost the interaction with a PTS1 protein, we screened for pex5 mutants that gained interaction with the PTS1 mutant Mdh3-SEL. Four suppressor mutants were selected in this positive two-hybrid screen (TableII). Remarkably, one mutant (pex5.sup2) contained a glutamic acid-to-lysine substitution at position 361 in TPR2, a mutation that is exactly the opposite of the mutation introduced in PTS1, i.e. lysine to glutamic acid. This suppressor mutant specifically suppressed the PTS1 mutation because it did not interact with Mdh3p from which PTS1 had been deleted (Mdh3ΔSKL). The other suppressor mutants still showed a weak, but detectable interaction with Mdh3ΔSKL (see “Discussion”). It is noteworthy that all suppressors were still able to bind to Mdh3p with wi"
https://openalex.org/W2118383521,"Stress-induced activation of an acidic sphingomyelinase leading to generation of ceramide, an important lipid mediator, has been associated with apoptosis; however, the implication of this hydrolase has been questioned. The present study aimed at re-evaluating the role of this lysosomal enzyme in apoptosis initiated by different apoptotic inducers. The sensitivity of a series of acid sphingomyelinase-deficient cell lines derived from Niemann-Pick disease patients to stress-induced apoptosis was investigated. We have now shown that stress stimuli, such as anthracyclines, ionizing radiation, and Fas ligation trigger similar apoptotic hallmarks in normal and acid sphingomyelinase-deficient cell lines. Retrovirus-mediated gene correction of enzyme deficiency in Niemann-Pick cells does not modify response to apoptosis. Ceramide production is comparable in normal and Niemann-Pick cells, and increased activity of neutral sphingomyelinase is observed. Thus, our findings cast serious doubts that lysosomal sphingomyelinase activation is responsible for stress-induced apoptosis of cultured cells."

One of these enzymes, DNA polymerase β, offers a simple system to relate polymerase structure to the fidelity of DNA synthesis. In this study, a mutator DNA polymerase β, Y265H, was identified using an in vivo genetic screen. Purified Y265H produced errors at a 40-fold higher frequency than the wild-type protein in a forward mutation assay. At 37 °C, transient kinetic analysis demonstrated that the alteration caused a 111-fold decrease in the maximum rate of polymerization and a 117-fold loss in fidelity for G misincorporation opposite template A. Our data suggest that the maximum rate of polymerization was reduced, because Y265H was dramatically impaired in its ability to perform nucleotidyl transfer in the presence of the correct nucleotide substrate. In contrast, at 20 °C, the mutant protein had a fidelity similar to wild-type enzyme. Both proteins at 20 °C demonstrate a rapid change in protein conformation, followed by a slow chemical step. These data suggest that proper geometric alignment of template, 3′-OH of the primer, magnesium ions, dNTP substrates, and the active site residues of DNA polymerase β are important factors in polymerase fidelity and provide the first evidence that Tyr-265 is important for this alignment to occur properly in DNA polymerase β.

DNA polymerases have the remarkable ability to select and incorporate a single deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)1 from a pool of structurally similar substrates in a template-dependent manner. During DNA synthesis, polymerases occasionally insert an incorrect dNTP substrate, whereas mutator enzymes incorporate the wrong nucleotides more frequently. Mutations resulting from DNA polymerases may be one of the underlying causes of human disease and cancer (1Loeb L.A. Christians F.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 350: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Loeb L.A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 25-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify the mechanisms used by polymerases to discriminate the correct dNTP substrates from incorrect ones. DNA polymerase β (pol β) offers a simple model to study fidelity, the ability to copy DNA accurately. This polymerase functions in base excision repair (3Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) and meiosis (4Plug A.W. Clairmont C.A. Sapi E. Ashley T. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unlike many other polymerases, pol β contains 2-deoxyribose-5′-phosphate lyase function (5Sobol R.W. Prasad R.

Consequently, the fidelity of pol β can be attributed to the polymerase itself in selecting and incorporating the correct dNTP substrate. The structures of pol β complexed with a single-nucleotide-gapped DNA, the physiological substrate of pol β (8Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a ternary complex containing the protein, gapped DNA, and dNTP have been solved (9Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). These structures share a common overall architecture and important conserved motifs with several other polymerases (10Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that pol β, like other DNA polymerases, catalyzes the nucleotidyl transfer reaction by the two-metal ion mechanism (11Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Finally, pol β has a minimal kinetic mechanism for DNA synthesis similar to most DNA polymerases (12Werneburg B.G. Ahn J. Zhong X. Hondal R.J. Kraynov V.S. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7041-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the enzyme binds to the DNA template first, followed by binding to the dNTP. After formation of the initial ternary complex of pol β, DNA, and dNTP, a conformational change occurs to produce a catalytically active complex that can extend a DNA primer. After chemical bond formation, pyrophosphate is released and pol β dissociates from the DNA substrate. The latter step is considered to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction pathway. To study the fidelity of DNA synthesis, a genetic screen was developed to identify mutator mutants of pol β (13Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M. Li S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) is located in a hydrophobic hinge region, which may mediate a conformational change of the polymerase (9Sawaya M.R.

In this study, the same genetic screen identified another pol β mutant containing a His substitution at Tyr-265 (Y265H). To determine the mechanistic basis for the mutator activity of Y265H, we studied the fidelity properties of β-WT and Y265H at 20 and 37 °C using transient-state kinetic methods, including rapid chemical quench flow and stopped-flow fluorescence. Our results suggest Y265H misincorporates dNTPs at 37 °C, because His in place of Tyr prevents the participation of the hydrophobic hinge in adopting the proper geometric alignment of active site residues, DNA template, 3′-OH terminus of the primer, magnesium ions, and dNTP substrate. Thus, Tyr-265 is an important amino acid residue in maintaining the fidelity of DNA polymerase β.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Keck Molecular Biology Center at Yale University and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cDNAs of β-WT and Y265H were subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) to generate a fusion protein containing six histidine residues attached to the amino terminus. These fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (20Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol.

The sequences of the DNA substrates are as follows: 45-22-22, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAAC CAACCTCGATCCAATGCCGTCC and 3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGXGTTGGAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG; 36-20-15, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAAGTCACCTCAATCCA and 3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTXTCAGTGGAGTTAGGT; 36-19-15, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAGTCACCTCAATCCA and 3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTXTCAGTGGAGTTAGGT. TheX position in the template contained an adenine or 2-aminopurine (2AP). The 20-mer primer terminus of 36-20-15 DNA substrate either contained or lacked the 3′-OH. The dideoxy-terminated primer was obtained by overnight incubation of the 19-mer (0.5 mm) with ddATP (0.5 mm) in manufacturer-supplied buffer (New England BioLabs), containing 0.25 mm CoCl2 and 200 units/ml terminal deoxynucleotide transferase at 37 °C. Unreacted primer and the product were separated by 20% denaturing gel electrophoresis, and the product was purified. Oligomer hybridization was performed. Briefly, the primer oligomer was labeled at the 5′-end by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) and [γ-32P]ATP or normal ATP. Other oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with the kinase and normal ATP. After purification of phosphorylated oligonucleotides and quantification, annealing was performed by mixing equimolar quantities of each DNA strand in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 m NaCl. The mixture was incubated sequentially at 95 °C (5 min), slowly cooled to 50 °C (for 30 min) and 50 °C (for 20 min), and immediately transferred to ice. To verify proper hybridization, the product was analyzed on an 18% native polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography or ethidium bromide staining. The dissociation constant of β-WT and Y265H for gapped DNA binding was measured using a gel mobility shift assay (21Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35866-35872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). pol β protein (0.1–500 nm) was incubated with 0.05 nm gapped DNA substrate in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature (23 °C) for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged for 30 s and loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel with the current running at 300 V at 4 °C. After loading, the voltage was reduced to 150 V. Bound protein was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The dissociation constant for DNA (Kd) was estimated from fitting the bound protein (Y) versus protein concentration (x) with the equation: Y = [(m ×x)/(x + Kd)] + b, where m is a scaling factor and b is the apparent minimum Y value. A KinTek Instruments Model RQF-3 rapid quench flow apparatus thermostatted at 20 or 37 °C was used for rapid chemical quench flow experiments. Unless noted, reactions were conducted in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmNaCl, and 10% glycerol). All concentrations given refer to the final concentrations after mixing. For pre-steady-state analysis, reactions were performed in which radiolabeled gapped DNA (300 nm45-22-22) was in 3-fold excess relative to pol β (100 nm). These reactions are referred to as burst experiments. Depending on the temperature and the enzyme used, the concentration of the dTTP solution was at least five times the dissociation constant (Kd) for dTTP (see below for Kddetermination). The concentration of dTTP that equals five times theKd are as follows: at 20 °C, [dTTP] = 1 mm for β-WT and [dTTP] = 0.05 mm for Y265H, whereas, at 37 °C, [dTTP] = 0.2 mm for β-WT and [dTTP] = 0.025 mm for Y265H. This ensures that the burst experiment was performed at saturating concentration of dTTP while minimizing any enzyme inhibition, which may occur with excess dTTP. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of the pol β·DNA and Mg·dTTP solutions (final concentration of MgCl2 = 10 mm). At selected time intervals, the reactions were quenched with 0.3 m EDTA. To determine the Kd for dNTP and the maximum rate of polymerization (kpol), incorporation of dTTP (correct) and dGTP (incorrect) opposite template A was examined as a function of time for the 45-22-22 DNA substrate. In these experiments, a solution containing a preincubated complex of β-WT or Y265H (500 nm) and radiolabeled gapped DNA (50 nm) was mixed with a solution of MgCl2 (10 mm) and varying concentrations of a single dNTP. The 10-fold excess concentration of enzyme relative to gapped DNA was determined by performing time courses at 5- and 10-fold enzyme concentrations over 45-22-22 DNA substrate at 50 μm dTTP for Y265H. The two different enzyme concentrations gave the same observed rate constant and amplitude. These conditions allow binding of greater than 95% of the DNA substrate by pol β. Thus, the rate of a single catalytic turnover of the enzyme is measured. Experiments for dTTP incorporation, which were performed on the KinTek apparatus, and for dGTP misincorporation, which were performed manually, were conducted under identical reaction conditions. For manual kinetics, a solution containing a preincubated β·DNA complex was incubated for 3 min at the reaction temperature. This solution was then mixed with a Mg·dGTP solution (0.025–4 mm). Aliquots (0.01 ml) were removed at selected time intervals and quenched into a 0.05-ml solution containing 0.5 m EDTA and 90% formamide, bromphenol dye (EDTA:dye, 7:4, v/v). Products were resolved by sequencing gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (20% acrylamide containing 8 m urea) and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Emission spectra of β-WT or Y265H complexed with single-bp-gapped DNA substrate in the absence and presence of dTTP were measured by excitation at 290 nm on an SLM AMINCO spectrofluorometer. Scans were performed in standard reaction buffer at 20 and 37 °C. A stopped-flow instrument (KinTek Corp.) was used to measure the rate of the polymerization reaction under single turnover conditions. Equal volumes (20 or 30 μl) of a solution containing a premixed complex of pol β (1.5 or 3 μm) and 2AP-gapped DNA (0.15 or 0.3 μm) in standard buffer and a solution of Mg·dTTP (saturating concentration; see above section for concentrations) were rapidly mixed. Changes in fluorescence were monitored using a 340-nm interference filter, a 320-nm cutoff filter, or a 305-nm cutoff filter (Corion) after excitation at 290 nm. Three to five traces were averaged. The use of different filters gave similar observed rate constants. Wild-type or mutant pol β (10 μm) in standard buffer was incubated in a 0.2-cm path-length quartz cuvette. The sample was then placed in a thermostatted block in a circular dichroism spectrophotometer (Aviv Model 62DS). Ellipticity was measured at 220 nm as a function of temperature over the range of 10–60 °C in 1 °C increments after the sample was equilibrated for 0.5 min at each temperature. Values were averaged for 15 s. The temperature at which the protein is 50% unfolded (Tm) was determined after the denaturation profile was subtracted by both upper and lower baselines. Data obtained from kinetic assays were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the KaleidaGraph program (Synergy Software). Data from burst experiments were fit to the equation: [product] = A × [1 − exp(−kobs t)] +kss t, where A is the amplitude of the burst, kobs is observed first-order rate constant for dNTP incorporation, andkss is the observed steady-state rate constant. Single-turnover kinetic data were fit to the single-exponential equation: [product] = A × [1 − exp(−kobs t)]. Observed rate constants were then plotted against [dNTP], and the data were fit to the hyperbolic equation: kobs =kpol[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP]), where kpol is the maximum rate of polymerization and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for dNTP. Fidelity values were calculated using the relationship: fidelity = [(kpol/Kd)c + (kpol/Kd)i]/(kpol/Kd)i], where c and i represent the correct and incorrect dNTPs, respectively. Stopped-flow data were fit to a single- or multiple-exponential equation, F = ΣAn × exp(−kobs,n t) +C, where F is the fluorescence at timet, n is the number of exponential terms,A and kobs are the amplitude and the observed rate constant of the nth term, respectively, andC is the fluorescence intensity at equilibrium. We compared the ability of β-WT and Y265H to fill a 203-nucleotide gap in the HSV-tk gene (17Opresko P.L. Sweasy J.B. Eckert K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Errors committed by the polymerase during synthesis inactivated the HSV-tk gene. The inactive HSV-tk products confer resistance to 5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine. In this assay, the spontaneous mutation frequencies for β-WT and Y265H were 9.6 × 10−4 and 380 × 10−4, respectively. Therefore, Y265H has a spontaneous mutation frequency 40 times greater than β-WT, which suggests that it has intrinsic mutator activity. A pre-steady-state burst experiment to monitor dTTP incorporation was performed under conditions where 45-22-22 DNA was in 3-fold excess of pol β. Fig.1 demonstrates insertion of dTTP oppositeA by β-WT (open circles) at 37 °C occurs via an initial fast phase (kobs = 7.2 ± 1.6 s−1) followed by a slower, linear phase with a rate constant of 2.1 s−1. In contrast, Y265H (closed circles) shows no initial, rapid product formation using the same conditions. The kobs of the mutant enzyme is 0.034 ± 0.002 s−1. At 20 °C, a burst experiment for β-WT displayed biphasic reaction kinetics, similar to the kinetics at the higher temperature, whereas Y265H showed a linear rate of product generation (data not shown). The biphasic nature of β-WT indicates that the rate-limiting step occurs after phosphodiester bond formation at both temperatures. In contrast, the rate-limiting step for Y265H polymerization is most likely before or during the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. A gel mobility shift assay was conducted to estimate the affinity of pol β for gapped DNA (data not shown). For 45-22-22 DNA substrate, the dissociation constants of β-WT and Y265H were 6.5 ± 1.3 and 36.6 ± 4.7 nm, respectively, indicating the formation of an E·DNA complex in both cases. Thus, there is a 5-fold loss of affinity for DNA with Y265H. Single-turnover kinetic experiments were performed under conditions where the enzyme concentration greatly exceeds (>10-fold) the Kd for gapped DNA. To understand the role of Tyr-265 in DNA synthesis fidelity, we determined whether the efficiency (kpol/Kd) for misincorporating dNTPs is higher for Y265H than β-WT. At 20 and 37 °C, experiments were performed where enzyme was in 10-fold excess over the DNA substrate. This approach allows us to measure the ground state binding of the dNTP, Kd, and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol (22Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The Kd and kpol values were determined by measuring the rate of product formation at varying concentrations of dNTP. Fig.2 A illustrates an example of dTTP incorporation opposite A for Y265H at several concentrations of nucleotide at 37 °C. By fitting each set of data to the single exponential rate equation, thekobs was determined for each dTTP substrate concentration. These values were plotted against the dTTP concentrations to yield the Kd andkpol parameters for Y265H (Fig. 2 B) and β-WT (Fig. 2 B, inset). The values forKd and kpol (TableI) were reduced by 9- (11/1.2) and 111-fold (9.7/0.087), respectively, for Y265H, relative to β-WT.Table ISingle-turnover kinetic constants for β-WT and Y265HkpolKd1-aUnits are micromolar.kpol(c)/kpol(i)1-bThe kpol for correct (c) divided by incorrect (i).Kd(i)/Kd(c) 1-cThe Kd for incorrect (i) dNTP divided by correct (c).kpol/KdF(×103) 1-dFidelity (F) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”s−1m−1s−1β-WTA:T1-eKinetic constants for incorporation of dTTP opposite A., T = 379.7 ± 0.711 ± 28.82 × 105A:G1-fKinetic parameters for misincorporation of dGTP opposite template A., T = 370.0113 ± 0.0007601 ± 968605318.846.9A:T, T = 203.5 ± 0.2155 ± 272.26 × 104A:G, T = 200.00097 ± 3.3 × 10−5195 ± 2036001.34.974.5Y265HA:T, T = 370.087 ± 0.0031.2 ± 0.17.25 × 104A:G, T = 370.0115 ± 3.0 × 10−457 ± 68482.02 × 1020.4A:T, T = 201.66 ± 0.062.6 ± 0.36.38 × 105A:G, T = 200.0042 ± 2.1 × 10−4171 ± 293956624.626.01-a Units are micromolar.1-b The kpol for correct (c) divided by incorrect (i).1-c The Kd for incorrect (i) dNTP divided by correct (c).1-d Fidelity (F) was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-e Kinetic constants for incorporation of dTTP opposite A.1-f Kinetic parameters for misincorporation of dGTP opposite template A. Open table in a new tab The kpol and Kd rate constants were used to calculate the fidelities for β-WT and Y265H. These values are shown in Table I. At 37 °C, a 117-fold loss in fidelity was observed for Y265H relative to β-WT. This loss is largely due to a reduced ability to discriminate between dTTPversus dGTP at the level of kpol. For β-WT, the maximum rate of polymerization of the correct dNTP is 860 times faster than the incorrect one, whereas Y265H displays only an 8-fold difference. Thus, substitution of His for Tyr-265 causes a 108-fold (860/8) loss in discrimination at the level ofkpol. The affinities for dNTP were higher for Y265H at 37 °C, however, the discrimination factor at the level of ground-state binding was similar for the two proteins. Surprisingly, the fidelity of Y265H is quite different at 20 °C. At this temperature, the fidelity of Y265H (26,000) was 6-fold higher than β-WT (4500) with the primary effect in the ability of Y265H to discriminate at the level of kpol. At 20 °C, Y265H has a discrimination factor for kpol that is 49-fold (395/8) higher than at 37 °C. Thus, at 20 °C, Y265H appears to have recovered the ability to discriminate at the level ofkpol. At this temperature, Y265H is able to discriminate at the level of ground-state binding (Kd) by a factor of 66, which is quantitatively similar (48) to its ability to discriminate at this level at 37 °C. In contrast, β-WT continues to discriminate the correct from the incorrect dNTP at 20 °C at the level of kpolbut not at the level of Kd. The discrimination provided at the level of ground-state binding for β-WT is 40-fold (53/1.3) less than at 37 °C. At 37 °C, Y265H has only an 8-fold discrimination factor at the level ofkpol. This parameter encompasses two rates: a protein conformational change and nucleotidyl transfer. To examine these two steps, adenine was replaced with 2AP as the templating base. The DNA structure remains relatively undisturbed with 2AP, because it still forms a Watson-Crick type base pair with thymine (24Sowers L.C. Fazackerly G.V. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To verify incorporation of dTTP, we performed burst experiments using the 2AP-gapped DNA. Similar to the data presented in Fig. 1 with natural DNA substrate, burst experiments show β-WT exhibits a biphasic kinetic profile with the 2AP-gapped DNA, whereas the initial fast phase is absent for Y265H (data not shown). These patterns were displayed for both proteins at 20 and 37 °C. Thus, the same kinetic profiles for each protein were obtained with the 2AP- and normal DNA substrates in burst experiments. This suggests the enzymes follow the same polymerization mechanism for dTTP incorporation with the 2AP-gapped DNA as they do with the normal gapped DNA substrate. Stopped-flow fluorescence with 36-20-15 2AP-gapped DNA substrate was used to monitor the rate of DNA polymerization for β-WT and Y265H at 20 and 37 °C under single-turnover conditions. This sequence context was used, because it was the DNA substrate for earlier studies of stopped-flow fluorescence with β-WT (25Zhong X. Patel S.S. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11891-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Zhong X.J. Patel S.S. Tsai M.D. J. Am. Chem.

The fluorescence of a single Trp residue in the carboxyl-terminal domain of pol β was monitored. The role of 2AP is to enhance the enzyme fluorescence change, possibly through fluorescence energy transfer from Trp to 2AP (25Zhong X. Patel S.S. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11891-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the rates of the fluorescence changes of β-WT and Y265H at 20 and 37 °C in the presence of correct dNTP substrate. In the presence of saturating dTTP, β-WT shows a rapid initial decrease (kobs = 111 ± 9 s−1) followed by a slower increase in fluorescence with a kobs of 10.6 ± 0.1 s−1 at 37 °C (Fig. 3 A). Both fluorescence phases demonstrated a dependence on magnesium and dTTP with gapped DNA substrate, similar to results obtained in an earlier study with duplex DNA (25Zhong X. Patel S.S. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11891-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An observed rate constant of 10.8 ± 0.6 s−1 was obtained with the quench-flow method with the same reaction conditions, indicating that only the second phase of the stopped-flow experiment is measured in the quench-flow instrument. The similar rates observed in the quench-flow and the stopped-flow experiments indicate that the sa"

The GST A1-1-catalyzed steroid isomerization provides a complement to the previously described isomerase activity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The biosynthesis of hormones such as testosterone, progesterone, and corticosteroids includes 3β-hydroxysteroid oxidation followed by a Δ5 to Δ4isomerization of the 3-ketosteroid product. In bacteria, such asPseudomonas species, the two consecutive steps are catalyzed by two distinct enzymes, a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and a 3-ketosteroid isomerase (1Talalay P. Wang V.S.

This GST reaction complements the activity of the bifunctional 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5→4isomerase (3β-HSD/Iso), but its relative efficiency and the role of GSH in catalysis have not previously been evaluated.In the present investigation the isomerization of AD catalyzed by the major human liver enzyme GST A1-1 has been studied in detail. This abundant isoenzyme was shown to be significantly more active with AD than the isomerase component of the bifunctional 3β-HSD/Iso previously described. Marked differences among related Alpha class GSTs in their ability to catalyze the isomerization of AD as well as the significance of an ionized thiol group of GSH acting as a base in the catalytic mechanism were also demonstrated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB),S-methylglutathione (GSMe), and reduced glutathione were obtained from Sigma. 2-Chloro-3,5-dinitro-1,1,1-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (o-CF3CDNB) was obtained from Aldrich.

Similarly, inhibition of the isomerization reaction by GSHex was measured in a series of reactions where AD was varied from 20 to 300 μm in 42 measurements at 5 mm of GSH and different concentrations of GSHex (0, 2, 4, and 8 μm).

Spectra of GSH bound to GST A1-1 and to Y9F were obtained by subtracting the spectra of free GSH at different pH values and of free enzyme at pH 6 from the spectrum of the sample. Concentration of enzyme was 9 μm, and the GSH concentration was 250 μm; measurements were done in 100 mm sodium phosphate.pH Dependence of the Isomerization Reaction Catalyzed by GST A1-1Kinetic parameters for GST A1-1 and Y9F were determined at different pH values with 2 mm GSH, at least 80% saturating in the crucial part of the pH range examined, and varying AD concentrations. Parameters for GST A1-1 in the absence of GSH were also obtained. Sodium phosphate buffers of 100 mm were used in the pH range 4.7–8. Above pH 8 and up to 9.7, 100 mmethanolamine HCl was used.RESULTSGSH Dependence of the Enzyme-catalyzed IsomerizationIn the absence of GSH and enzyme a slow but measurable conversion of 100 μm AD into its isomer was observed (TableI). GSH (1 mm) afforded a 2-fold increased reaction rate at pH 8.0. The presence of GST A1-1 under conditions similar to those used for specific activity measurements, but in the absence of GSH, increased the rate of the isomerization about 16 times at 1 μm enzyme concentration (Table I). The presence of both GST A1-1 and GSH further increased the reaction rate 240 times so that the overall rate enhancement was about 3800-fold. Replacement of GSH by 1 mm GSMe gave an enzymatic activity lower than that in the absence of GSH, demonstrating that GSMe inhibits the GST A1-1-catalyzed reaction. The nonenzymatic isomerization rate was the same in the presence and absence of GSMe.Optimization of Conditions for Specific Activity DeterminationsModifications of the original assay system defining the specific activity (5Benson A.M. Talalay P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) increased the specific activity of GST A1-1 from ∼10 to 40 μmol min−1mg−1 and brought the assay closer to physiological conditions. With the new conditions (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm GSH, 100 μm AD, and 1%, v/v, methanol) the blank reaction, in the absence of enzyme, was low in comparison with the catalyzed reaction, and data were reproducible.Steady-state Kinetics of Alpha Class GSTs with Δ5-Androstene-3,17-dioneSteady-state kinetic experiments were made in which both GSH and AD concentrations were varied independently. In addition, specific activities with both CDNB and AD were determined (Table II). The data were in agreement with a random sequential two-substrate mechanism for all GSTs investigated (cf. Fig.2). The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting Equation 1 to the experimental data.v=V[A][B]/(KmBKsA+KmB[A]+KmA[B]+[A][B])Equation 1 K sA is the substrate dissociation constant (36Cleland W.W.

The K mGSH values range between 15 and 230 μm, with the Y9F value being lowest and the GST A4-4 value highest. The K mADvalues are all of the same order of magnitude except that for GST A2-2, which is 4–10 times higher. The values for GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 are the same within the experimental error. The reaction rate enhancement afforded by GST A1-1, defined as the ratio ofk cat/K mAD to the rate constant of the uncatalyzed reaction was calculated as (1.3 ± 0.1)·1010m−1.Competing Alternative Substrate and Dead-end InhibitionAD inhibited the GST A1-1-catalyzed GSH conjugation of the alternative substrate o-CF3CDNB in a linear competitive manner (Fig.3).

Upon binding of GSH to wild-type GST A1-1, the thiol pK aof 9.2 is lowered by 2.5 pH units to 6.7, in agreement with the previous estimate of pK a 6.7 (37Gustafsson A. Etahadieh M. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16268-16275Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mutant Y9F only decreased the thiol pK a by 2.0 pH units to 7.2.Figure 4GSH thiolate formation as a function of pH in the absence of enzyme, in the presence of GST A1-1, and in the presence of the active site mutant Y9F.

At pH 8, in the absence of GSH, and with as much as 12 μm Y9F, the reaction rate was lower than the nonenzymatic rate observed with AD in the absence of enzyme, indicating partial inhibition of the isomerization by binding of AD to the protein.Figure 5pH dependence ofk cat andk cat/K mADfor GST A1-1 and Y9F.

The presence of 1 mm GSH markedly raises this rate, while the same concentration of GSMe gives no detectable effect as compared with the rate observed with AD alone. Since the sulfur of GSMe is blocked by a methyl group, this suggests that the sulfhydryl group of GSH is important for the catalytic effect.GST A1-1, in the absence of GSH, also increases the rate of the reaction as compared with either the presence of AD alone or the presence of AD together with GSH (Table I). The largest reaction rate enhancement, ∼4000-fold, is obtained when AD, GSH, and GST A1-1 are all present (Table I). It should be noted that in tissues the enzyme concentration may be 100-fold higher (100 μm) with a corresponding higher rate enhancement. However, when GSMe is substituting for GSH, the activity of GST A1-1 decreases to a level below the rate for GST A1-1 and AD alone. It is possible that GSMe binds to the enzyme with its methyl group entering the binding site for AD, thereby blocking entry of the steroid. An alternative explanation would be that the Δ5-3-ketosteroid transformation is attenuated indirectly by the interaction between enzyme and GSMe. The lack of catalytic effect of GSMe also demonstrates that GSH does not promote the reaction simply through a ligand-induced conformational change of the enzyme into a catalytically competent state.The simultaneous action of GST A1-1 on AD and o-CF3CDNB, an alternative substrate more reactive than its analogue (35Widersten M. Björnestedt R. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7731-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), CDNB, results in alternative substrate competition (Fig. 3) with an apparentK iAD value of 81 μm (TableIII) similar to the K mAD value of 58 μm (Table II). The conjugation reaction is measured at pH 6.5 and the isomerization reaction at pH 8.0, but sinceK mAD values of the data presented in thek cat/K mAD curve (Fig. 5 B) show no marked change with pH, these results suggest that the similar K iAD andK mAD values reflect the same interaction with the protein and that the alternative substrates AD and o-CF3CDNB compete for the same binding site.GSHex is a competitive inhibitor of conjugation reactions catalyzed by GST A1-1. Thus, GSHex competes with GSH for the G-site; the hexyl group of the inhibitor binds into the H-site and obstructs the steroid from binding. This, together with the results from the alternative substrate experiments, indicates that the isomerization of AD takes place in the active center of GST A1-1 and that AD occupies the H-site. This rules out the possibility that catalysis takes place in the cleft between the two protein subunits (16Ji X. von Rosenvinge E.C. Johnson W.W. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The conclusion is supported by results with the homologous rat GST A1-1 showing that AD does not protect against affinity labeling with steroid derivatives that target the nonsubstrate steroid binding site (38Barycki J.J.

Fatty acids affect β-cell function, and LpL overexpression decreases insulin secretion in cell lines, but whether LpL is regulated in β-cells is unknown. To test the hypothesis that glucose and insulin regulate LpL activity in β-cells, we studied pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells. Acute exposure of β-cells to physiological concentrations of glucose stimulated both total cellular LpL activity and heparin-releasable LpL activity. Glucose had no effect on total LpL protein mass but instead promoted the appearance of LpL protein in a heparin-releasable fraction, suggesting that glucose stimulates the translocation of LpL from intracellular to extracellular sites in β-cells. The induction of heparin-releasable LpL activity was unaffected by treatment with diazoxide, an inhibitor of insulin exocytosis that does not alter glucose metabolism but was blocked by conditions that inhibit glucose metabolism. In vitro hyperinsulinemia had no effect on LpL activity in the presence of low concentrations of glucose but increased LpL activity in the presence of 20 mm glucose. Using dual-laser confocal microscopy, we detected intracellular LpL in vesicles distinct from those containing insulin. LpL was also detected at the cell surface and was displaced from this site by heparin in dispersed islets and INS-1 cells. These results show that glucose metabolism controls the trafficking of LpL activity in β-cells independent of insulin secretion. They suggest that hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance may contribute to progressive β-cell dysfunction by increasing LpL-mediated delivery of lipid to islets.

In adipocytes, LpL is increased by activation of protein kinase C (α, β, δ, and ε isoforms) and inhibition of protein kinase C decreases LpL synthesis (16Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Insulin increases adipocyte LpL activity by both post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms (17Semenkovich C.F. Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is attenuated by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway (18Kraemer F.B. Takeda D. Natu V. Sztalryd C. Metab. Clin.

In cardiac muscle cells, the stimulatory effect of insulin on LpL requires dexamethasone and appears to exert its effects by altering the cytoskeleton (19Ewart H.S. Carroll R. Severson D.L. Can. J.

However, insulin does not regulate LpL in murine peritoneal macrophages and macrophage cell lines (7Behr S.R. Kraemer F.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 889: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Glucose is known to regulate LpL in adipocytes (21Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Biol.

Incubation of rat adipocytes in the absence of glucose produces a 49-kDa form of LpL that is catalytically inactive and not secreted (21Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3177-3182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same cells, incubation in the presence of glucose produces a 55-kDa catalytically active form of LpL that is secreted. Glucose is essential for glycosylation, which is required for LpL enzymatic activity (23Semenkovich C.F. Luo C.C. Nakanishi M.K. Chen S.H. Smith L.C. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5429-5433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and increases the rate of LpL translational and post-translational events. Glucose regulation of LpL expression in macrophages differs from adipocytes. Sartippour et al. (24Sartippour M.R. Lambert A. Laframboise M. St. Jacques P. Renier G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that glucose increases LpL expression in J774 macrophages in a protein kinase C- and AP1-dependent manner. LpL regulation in pancreatic islets has not been studied.LpL mRNA was recently identified in human and mouse islets as well as insulinoma cells (15Marshall B.A. Tordjman K. Host H.H. Ensor N.J.

LpL expression was shown to be inversely related to insulin secretion, indicating that LpL may be a physiologically relevant provider of fatty acids to β-cells. In this study, we address the regulation of LpL in β-cells. Our results show that glucose metabolism controls the intracellular trafficking of LpL-containing vesicles through mechanisms that function independent of the exocytosis of insulin. Hyperglycemia-induced translocation of LpL to the cell surface, a process amplified by hyperinsulinemia, represents a potential mechanism underlying the progressive β-cell lipotoxicity associated with insulin resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMale C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). CMRL-1066 and RPMI 1640 tissue culture media, penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and l-glutamine were obtained from Life Technologies. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone (Logan, UT). Collagenase type P was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Ficoll, d-mannoheptulose, diazoxide, purified LpL, and low molecular weight (M r 3000–5000) heparin were from Sigma. Rat sera, a source of apolipoprotein C-II, was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and Chemicon. Glycerol tri-[14C]oleate was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For Western blot analysis, the primary antibody was chicken-anti-bovine milk LpL (25Coleman T. Seip R.L. Gimble J.M. Lee D. Maeda N. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol.

For immunohistochemical studies, the primary antibodies were rabbit-anti-human LpL (26Seip R.L. Angelopoulos T.J. Semenkovich C.F. Am. J.

The secondary antibodies were FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-conjugated donkey-anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution containing MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inert salt reagent) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).Pancreatic Islet Isolation and CultureIslets were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice by collagenase digestion as previously reported (28McDaniel M.L. Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Islets were cultured overnight in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in CMRL-1066 tissue culture medium (CMRL) containing 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Mouse islets (200 per experimental condition) were cultured in 35-mm sterile dishes.Cell CultureAll experiments were performed in triplicate. INS-1 and RINm5F cells were maintained under conditions previously described (15Marshall B.A. Tordjman K. Host H.H. Ensor N.J. Kwon G. Marshall C.A. Coleman T. McDaniel M.L. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol.

(30Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), were a kind gift from Chris Newgard (Dallas, TX).Isolated pancreatic mouse islets (200) were seeded into a 35-mm dish containing 1 ml of culture media. The islets were washed with CMRL (without fetal calf serum, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 3 mm glucose) and incubated for 30 min prior to acute exposure (4 h) to 3 or 20 mm glucose. For studies using diazoxide or mannoheptulose, these agents were present during the preincubation and glucose stimulation period. For determining the effect of room temperature, preincubation and glucose stimulation protocols were performed in a gassed, humidified chamber at 25 °C. Glucose stimulation was performed by replacing preincubation media with stimulation media (containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 3 or 20 mm glucose).After glucose stimulation, islets were collected and media replaced with 125 μl of CMRL containing 100 μg/ml heparin and incubated for 30 min. The heparin-containing media were then collected, a detergent solution was added to the plates, and the islets were incubated until visually dissolved. The heparin-containing media and the detergent extracts were assayed for LpL activity (described below). The stimulation culture supernatant was assayed for insulin by radioimmunoassay.INS-1 cells (3 × 106) were seeded in 12-well culture plates 48 h prior to glucose stimulation. Preincubation and acute glucose stimulation of INS-1 cells were performed as described with mouse islets, except cells were cultured in RPMI media, and the absence of glucose was used for the basal conditions. The effect of prolonged insulin exposure (24 h) was performed by adding exogenous porcine insulin (0.25, 0.5, or 1 μm) to the incubation media. After acute exposure to an elevated glucose concentration or prolonged exposure to exogenous insulin, heparin was added to the incubation media to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min. The culture media were then collected, a detergent solution was added, and cells were incubated until visually dissolved. The heparin-containing culture supernatant and the detergent extract were assayed for LpL activity as described below. The culture supernatant was assayed for insulin.LpL Enzyme Activity AssayLipase activity was measured by an in vitro assay in which radiolabeled fatty acids esterified to glycerol are cleaved and recovered after a chloroform/methanol/heptane-based extraction (17Semenkovich C.F. Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The units of activity are reported as moles of free fatty acid released per specific number of islets or cells per unit time. LpL activity is distinguishable from other lipase activities by its sensitivity to high molar salt concentration (4Bengtsson G. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 751: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). “Heparin-releasable” LpL activity is the amount of activity in the supernatant of heparin-treated islets or cells. “Detergent-extractable” is the amount of activity after detergent solubilization of remaining cells or islet pellets following heparin treatment. Detergent solubilization involves incubating β-cells or islet pellets with a detergent solution containing 2.0 g/liter deoxycholate for 30 min at 37 °C. “Total LpL activity” is the amount of activity after detergent solubilization of cells or islet pellets that have not been exposed to heparin-treatment.Cellular Metabolism AssayMetabolism was determined using an assay based on the ability of NADH or NADPH generated by substrate flux to reduce a tetrazolium substrate and produce a stable colored product. INS-1 or RINm5F cells were cultured in 96-well culture plates (2 × 105 cells/well). At the start of the experiment, the cells were washed with culture media and stimulated with glucose as described above. Subsequently, 20 μl/well tetrazolium reagent was added to the media and the optical density at 540 nm was determined after 4 h on a Molecular Devices Thermomax plate reader (Sunnyvale, CA).ImmunohistochemistryDispersed islets were obtained by dispase digestion of freshly isolated mouse islets and cultured for 24 h in 5.5 mm glucose. Duplicated aliquots of dispersed islet cells were treated with or without heparin (100 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to centrifugation onto glass slides and fixation in Bouin's solution. INS-1 cells (30,000) were seeded into 8-well collagen I-coated culture slides (Becton Dickinson, Beford, MA) and cultured for 48 h in the absence of glucose. Paired wells containing INS-1 cells were treated with or without heparin (100 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to fixation in Bouin's solution. Fixed cells were assayed for insulin and LpL localization using antibodies as described above followed by FITC-conjugated donkey anti-primary antibodies that allowed fluorescence detection. Visualization of localization of LpL and insulin in cells was performed with a Sarastro 2000 dual-laser Zeiss Axioskop confocal microscope.RESULTSAcute Glucose Exposure Stimulates LpL Activity but Not Total LpL MassTo determine whether glucose acutely stimulates LpL activity in islets, we first measured total LpL activity in mouse islets. In preliminary experiments, LpL enzyme activity (defined by salt inhibition and apoCII dependence) was detected in islets and shown to be linearly dependent on the number of islets assayed (data not shown). Glucose caused a time-dependent stimulation of mouse islet total LpL activity (Fig. 1). LpL enzyme activity was 91% higher in the presence of 20 mm glucose in comparison to basal glucose (3 mm) following a 4-h incubation period (p < 0.01). The same effect was seen at 8 h. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from these islets at 1, 4, and 8 h increased over basal secretion by 12-, 20-, and 2.5-fold, respectively (data not shown).Western blotting (Fig. 2) of mouse islets (lanes 2 and 3), and the β-cell lines INS-1 (lanes 4 and 5), and RINm5F (lanes 6and 7) showed that these cell types produce an LpL protein with the same molecular weight as LpL from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (lane 1). However, total LpL mass was not increased in any of these cell types after incubation in 20 mm glucose for 4 h (compare lanes 2 versus 3, 4 versus 5, and 6 versus 7). These results suggest that post-translational mechanisms contribute to the acute induction of LpL enzyme activity in β-cells.Figure 2Acute exposure to an elevated glucose concentration does not increase total LpL mass in pancreatic islets or β-cell lines. Triplicate groups/wells containing 200 pancreatic islets (lanes 2 and 3) or 3 × 106 cells (INS-1, lanes 4 and5, or RIN-m5F, lanes 6 and 7)/well were incubated in basal (3 mm for islets; none for INS-1 or RIN-m5F cells, even-numbered lanes) or elevated (20 mm, odd-numbered lanes) glucose for 4 h. Islets or cells were dissolved in SDS extraction buffer, the pooled extract was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed using a chicken anti-LPL-specific antibody and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-chicken antibody followed by detection with chemiluminescence. Data shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Acute Glucose Exposure Stimulates LpL Translocation to the Plasma MembraneIn adipocytes, physiologically relevant LpL is thought to reside in a cellular compartment at or close to the cell surface. LpL at this site is released to the media by heparin. To determine whether glucose affects the proportion of LpL that is accessible to heparin, we examined LpL enzyme activity and LpL protein mass from glucose-stimulated islets and INS-1 cells after treatment with 100 μg/ml heparin. Heparin-releasable LpL activity from mouse islets (Fig. 3 A) and INS-1 cells (Fig. 3 B) was significantly higher after 4-h exposure to 20 mm glucose than with basal glucose treatment. Heparin-releasable LpL protein mass also increased in INS-1 cells treated with 20 mm glucose for 4 h (Fig.4, lanes 3 versus 5). These data suggest that glucose acutely promotes the translocation of active LpL to the surface of β-cells.Figure 3Acute exposure to elevated glucose concentration increases heparin-releasable LpL activity in islets (A) and INS-1 cells (B). Triplicate groups/wells of islets or 3 × 106 INS-1 cells/well were incubated in basal (3 mm for islets; none for INS-1 cells) or elevated (20 mm) glucose for 4 h. Following the incubation periods, the islets or cells were exposed to 100 μg/ml low molecular weight heparin for 30 or 45 min. The culture supernatant was collected, the remaining islets or cells were dissolved in detergent extract buffer, and the heparin supernatant and extract were assayed for LpL activity. The same results were seen in more than three experiments.

Following the incubation periods, the cells were incubated for 45 min with 100 μg/ml low molecular weight heparin. The culture supernatants were collected, pooled, and concentrated using heparin-treated Amicon filters 10,000 nominal molecular weight limit (hep.).

Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we studied the relationship between glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and LpL activity in islets and β-cells. Diazoxide, an agent known to hyperpolarize β-cells and inhibit insulin secretion, blocked glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig.5 A) but did not affect glucose-stimulated LpL activity (Fig. 5 B) or glucose metabolism (data not shown). Inhibition of glucose metabolism by incubation at 25 °C or in the presence of mannoheptulose (10 mm) prevented the stimulation of LpL activity by glucose (Fig. 5 B) as well as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 5 A). Incubation at 25 °C or in the presence of mannoheptulose decreased glucose metabolism by 50% and 100%, respectively (data not shown).Figure 5Effect of room temperature incubation, mannoheptulose, or diazoxide on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (A) and LpL activity (B) in islets. Mouse islets were incubated in basal (3 mm) or elevated (20 mm) glucose for 4 h in the presence or absence of 10 mm mannoheptulose, 250 μmdiazoxide, or at room temperature. Following the incubation periods, the islets were exposed to 100 μg/ml low molecular weight heparin for 30 min, then the culture supernatant was collected and assayed for insulin content (A) and heparin-releasable LpL activity (B). Cells were also assayed for cellular metabolism using MTS and measuring A 540 for each well. Identical results were seen in three experiments.

Treatment of INS-1 cells with 0.25–1.0 μm exogenous insulin caused a dose-dependent increase in heparin-releasable LpL activity above that produced by 20 mm glucose alone (Fig.6). This effect required elevated glucose concentrations, because exogenous insulin at 1.0 μm did not stimulate LpL activity at low glucose concentrations (1 mm).Figure 6Long-term exposure to exogenous insulin stimulates LpL activity in INS-1 cells. Triplicate wells containing 3 × 106 INS-1 cells/well were incubated in basal (1 mm) or elevated (20 mm) glucose for 24 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm insulin. Following the incubation period, the cells were exposed to 100 μg/ml low molecular weight heparin for 45 min. The culture supernatant was collected, the remaining cells were dissolved in detergent extract buffer, and the heparin supernatant and extract were assayed for LpL activity.

To address this issue directly, we used fluorescent immunohistochemistry to localize these proteins in β-cells. Dual-laser confocal fluorescent microscopic images of islets (Fig.7) showed that LpL (red) and insulin (green) reside in separate vesicles within insulin-expressing β-cells. Membrane-associated LpL present on β-cells (Fig. 7A, white arrows) was not observed in heparin-treated cells (Fig. 7 B). Similar results were seen in INS-1 cells (Fig. 8). Serial confocal microscopy sections showed that both control (panels A–C) and heparin-treated (panels D–F) INS-1 cells contained insulin (green) and LpL (red) residing in separate vesicles. However, INS-1 cells were polarized with respect to LpL expression with the heparin-releasable fraction localized to the apical region. Panels A and D of Fig. 8 represent the apical region of cells, panels B and Eintermediate levels, and panels C and F basal regions. Apical-associated LpL (indicated by white arrows inA) was not observed after heparin-treatment (D). For both dispersed islet cells and INS-1 cells, heparin displacement of membrane-associated LpL was seen in the majority of cells.Figure 7LpL is located in insulin-expressing cells in pancreatic islets. Dispersed islet cells were isolated and cultured for 24 h. Control, untreated (A) or heparin-treated (B) dispersed islet cells were centrifuged onto glass slides and fixed with Bouin's solution. Insulin (FITC,green) and LpL (Cy3, red) expression were detected using fluorescence immunohistochemistry observed using a dual-laser confocal microscope. The acquired images demonstrate separate and distinct areas of localization for insulin and LpL. Heparin treatment (B) results in the removal of membrane-associated LpL (white arrows, A). The same results were seen using two independent islet cell preparations, and the images shown are representative of the appearance of cells on multiple different slides.

Basolateral membrane expression in epithelia and persistent cell surface exposure of stem cell factor are required for complete biological activity in pigmentation, fertility, learning, and hematopoiesis. Here we show by site-directed mutagenesis that the cytoplasmic domain of stem cell factor contains a monomeric leucine-dependent basolateral targeting signal. N-terminal to this motif, a cluster of acidic amino acids serves to increase the efficiency of basolateral sorting mediated by the leucine residue. Hence, basolateral targeting of stem cell factor requires a mono-leucine determinant assisted by a cluster of acidic amino acids. This mono-leucine determinant is functionally conserved in colony-stimulating factor-1, a transmembrane growth factor related to stem cell factor. Furthermore, this leucine motif is not capable of inducing endocytosis, allowing for persistent cell surface expression of stem cell factor. In contrast, the mutated cytoplasmic tail found in the stem cell factor mutant Mgf Sl17Hinduces constitutive endocytosis by a motif that is related to signals for endocytosis and lysosomal targeting.

This site is used to generate soluble growth factor from the M1 membrane-bound precursor. The membrane anchor of SCF is required for its biological activity in vivo because the expression of only the extracellular receptor binding domain leads to the loss of SCF-dependent cells affecting skin pigmentation, sterility, hematopoiesis, and learning (2Brannan C.I.

Bedell M.A. Resnick J.L. Eppig J.J. Handel M.A. Williams D.E. Lyman S.D. Donovan P.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Kapur R.

In this mouse mutant, cell surface expression of SCF is reduced, and basolateral sorting in epithelial tissues is lost (8Wehrle-Haller B. Weston J.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hence, the cytoplasmic tail of SCF harbors information required for efficient cell surface presentation and basolateral targeting of SCF, functions that are absolutely required to fulfill its function in vivo. stem cell factor colony-stimulating factor-1 trans-Golgi network green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein interleukin-2 receptor α-chain Madin-Darby canine kidney phosphofurin acidic cluster-sorting Polarized epithelial cells exhibit an apical and basolateral surface with distinct protein compositions. Basolateral sorting of transmembrane proteins takes place in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or endosomal compartments and is mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles (9Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Selective incorporation of proteins into these transport vesicles is accomplished by adaptor complexes (10Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Short cytoplasmic targeting sequences frequently containing either a tyrosine or di-leucine motif have been identified in the sorted proteins and are required for the interaction with adaptor complexes and for basolateral transport of the proteins (11Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently a tyrosine-based targeting motif has been shown to bind to an epithelial specific AP1 subunit that is required for basolateral transport (12Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). When the tyrosine or the di-leucine sorting domains are removed from the proteins, apical instead of basolateral sorting occurs, mediated byN-linked carbohydrates or by association with lipid rafts (13Benting J.H. Rietveld A.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M.S. Hauri H.P. Matter K.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Some basolateral sorting signals resemble endocytic signals used to incorporate membrane proteins into clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane, suggesting that basolateral sorting and endocytosis are regulated by similar mechanisms. For example, the macrophage Fc receptor and the invariant chain of the class II major histocompatibility complex contain a di-leucine-based determinant that is used for basolateral sorting as well as endocytosis (16Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 17Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many membrane proteins carry several different targeting determinants, which enables them to shuttle between the basolateral plasma membrane and endosomes (18Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although SCF does not have typical tyrosine or di-leucine sorting sequences in its cytoplasmic tail, it is delivered directly to the basolateral cell surface in epithelial cells and does not accumulate in an intracellular compartment (8Wehrle-Haller B. Weston J.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consequently, SCF remains at the cell surface until the extracellular domain is proteolytically shed within 0.5 (M1) to 5 (M2) h depending on the respective splice form (20Huang E.J. Nocka K.H. Buck J. Besmer P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Because basolateral sorting is critical for the proper biological function of SCF, we tried to identify the possibly novel basolateral targeting determinant in the cytoplasmic tail of SCF. To do so, we used reporter constructs consisting of extracellular green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged SCF or chimeras of the extracellular domain of the interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (Tac) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences of SCF. In these chimeras the normal intracellular domain of SCF is left intact, allowing optimal interaction of the latter with the sorting machinery of polarized cells and the identification of critical targeting domains by mutagenesis. cDNA for SCF and Tac were kindly provided by Drs. John Flanagan (Harvard Medical School, Boston) and Pierre Cosson (University of Geneva, Switzerland), respectively. Mouse CSF-1 and mouse tyrosinase cDNAs were kindly provided by Drs. Willy Hofstetter (MMI, Bern, Switzerland) and Friedrich Beermann (ISREC, Lausanne, Switzerland), respectively. SCF-GFP chimeras were constructed in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) by inserting the enhanced GFP sequence (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) together with a Myc tag 5′ into the exon 5/6 junction of SCF (SSTLGPEK/DSRV), which resulted in the following sequence: SSTLGPEQKLISEEDLGQS··IV … (enhanced GFP) … YK··TGPEK/DSRV (single letter amino acid code; the sequence of the Myc tag is underlined). To prevent translation at internal start sites producing cytoplasmic GFP, we replaced the start codon of GFP with nucleotides coding for a ClaI site. A unique PinAI site was introduced C-terminal to the GFP sequence to swap wild-type and mutant cytoplasmic tail sequences at this site. To generate the Tac-SCF chimera (all in pcDNA3), the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of SCF were swapped at a uniqueBglII site in Tac located at a homologous leucine (L) and glutamine (Q) residue upstream of the transmembrane sequences of SCF and Tac. This resulted in the sequence: … SIFTTDLQ WTAMALP … at this position (conserved LQ is bold and transmembrane residues of SCF are underlined). The Tac-CSF-1 and Tac-tyrosinase (Tac-tyr) chimeras were constructed in a similar way. CSF-1 and tyrosinase transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences were polymerase chain reaction amplified with aBglII site containing the forward primers (CSF-1: AACAGATCTCCAGATCCCTGAGTCTG; tyrosinase: AACAGATCTCCAAGCCAGTCGTATCTGG) at a common glutamine residue (Q) and swapped with the Tac sequence of this region creating the respective junctional sequences: Tac-CSF-1: … SIFTDLQIPESVFHLLV … and Tac-tyr: … SIFTTDLQASRIWPWLL … (the common glutamine residue (Q) is bold, and the respective transmembrane region is underlined). Tac-EGFP was cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification of EGFP with a HindIII-containing primer and inserted at a unique HindIII site at the extreme C terminus of Tac (TIQASSstop) resulting in the new junctional sequence (TIQASTMV … (EGFP)). Site-specific mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic tail of SCF was performed using polymerase chain reaction overlap extension. Two overlapping polymerase chain reaction fragments containing a specific mutation were amplified with external primers (containing either the PinAI or BglII site for SCF-GFP or Tac-SCF chimeras, respectively) and swapped with the wild-type sequence of the cytoplasmic tail. All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. A list of primers used to generate the different constructs listed in Fig. 2 can be provided upon request. MDCK II cells were kindly provided by Dr. Karl Matter (University of Geneva, Switzerland) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Inotech, Dottikon, Switzerland). Cells at 60% confluence were transfected using calcium phosphate as described (21Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and stable clones were selected with 0.6 mg ml−1 G418 (Life Technologies). For each construct, at least two different clones were analyzed for the steady-state distribution of SCF-GFP fluorescence or anti-Tac immunohistochemistry. To visualize the GFP fluorescence, cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips. Prior to observation, the culture medium was exchanged with F-12 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to reduce autofluorescence, which is higher in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were mounted on an inverted confocal microscope (LSM-410, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and visualized with standard fluorescein isothiocyanate optics. To reveal the localization of transfected Tac-SCF chimeras or endogenous E-cadherin in SCF-GFP-transfected MDCK II cells, monolayers of stable transfected clones grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then stained as indicated with either anti-Tac monoclonal antibody 7G7 (22Rubin L.A. Kurman C.C. Biddison W.E. Goldman N.D. Nelson D.L. Hybridoma. 1985; 4: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or with anti-Arc-1 monoclonal antibody (23Imhof B.A. Vollmers H.P. Goodman S.L. Birchmeier W. Cell. 1983; 35: 667-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which is directed against canine E-cadherin. After washing, bound antibodies were revealed with Texas Red-coupled anti-mouse antibodies (Southern Biotechnoloy Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL). Fluorescence was subsequently analyzed on a confocal microscope as indicated above. Contrast enhancement was performed in Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Wild-type and mutant Tac-SCF constructs were transfected into SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) using Fugen 6 according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). 2 days after transfection, cells were cooled on ice, and anti-Tac antibodies were added for 1 h at 1 μg ml−1. Prior to warming, unbound antibodies were washed away, and internalization was allowed for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies that remained cell surface-bound were subsequently removed with ice-cold acidic glycine buffer (0.1m, pH 2.5). Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed, permeabilized, blocked, and stained with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Southern Biotech) to reveal internalized anti-Tac·Tac-SCF complexes (see above). Cells were viewed on an Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a digital camera (C4742-95, Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) and the Openlab software (Improvision, Oxford, UK). Contrast enhancement was done in Photoshop (Adobe). The experiment was performed three times with qualitatively similar results, and representative examples of cells from one experiment were chosen for Fig. 7. GFP was inserted into the alternatively spliced extracellular domains of both membrane-bound variants of SCF and transfected into polarized epithelial MDCK II cells (Fig. 1). Confocal microscopy revealed that both wild-type constructs accumulated in basal and lateral membranes where they colocalized with E-cadherin, a marker for the lateral membrane compartment in polarized epithelial cells (shown for M2 variant; Fig. 1). To identify the motif in the cytoplasmic tail of SCF responsible for basolateral sorting, we created various cytoplasmic SCF mutants of the membrane-bound (M2) form of GFP-tagged SCF (SCF-GFP) (Fig.2 A). Mutants lacking the last eight C-terminal amino acids (d36, d29) still localized to the basolateral membrane. However, when 15 or more amino acids were deleted (d22, d12), SCF-GFP was located on the apical membrane and showed no basolateral expression. The critical region for basolateral sorting was demonstrated to reside within the sequence21NEISMLQQ28 because an internal deletion mutant (d21–28) also localized to the apical membrane. Interestingly, to be functional, it appeared that this sequence must be considerably separated from the membrane; deletion of intervening amino acids proximal to the membrane (d5–20) interfered with basolateral sorting. Increasing the distance of the 21NEISMLQQ28motif from the membrane by reinserting amino acids 5–11 (d12–20) only partially rescued basolateral targeting, suggesting that other amino acids important for basolateral targeting are present N-terminal to the21NEISMLQQ28 motif (see below). Sequence comparison among human, mouse, chicken, and salamander SCF (24Parichy D.M. Stigson M. Voss S.R. Dev. Genes Evol. 1999; 209: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) revealed the residues 24SML26 as being completely conserved within the 21NEISMLQQ28motif (Fig. 2 B). This sequence encompasses a serine at position 24 as well as a di-hydrophobic methionine-leucine at positions 25 and 26, respectively (see above). To test whether a portion of this motif was required for basolateral sorting of SCF, we created various point mutations encompassing these conserved residues (Fig.2 B and Fig. 3). The modification of serine 24 to either an alanine (S24A) or to an aspartic acid (S24D) resembling a phosphoserine, as well as the replacement of the conserved glutamic acid 19 by lysine (E19K) had no effect on basolateral targeting (Fig. 3, C, E, F). In contrast, the modification of leucine 26 to either alanine (L26A) or the replacement of methionine 25 and leucine 26 by a double-alanine (M25A/L26A) led to apical accumulation of the mutant SCF-GFP constructs (Fig. 3,B and D). The analysis of the SCF-GFP chimeric mutant proteins thus suggests that the leucine at position 26 of the cytoplasmic tail of SCF is critical for basolateral sorting of SCF. However, it is not known whether this putative basolateral signal requires the context of dimerized SCF molecules or whether it can provide intracellular targeting information independently. Dimer formation involving the extracellular domain of SCF or lateral association of the extracellular and/or intracellular portions of SCF with other proteins that contain targeting information may in fact be responsible for the polarized expression of SCF. Therefore, to test the ability of the cytoplasmic targeting sequence of SCF to mediate polarized expression independently of the extracellular domain, we replaced the latter with the extracellular domain of Tac (Fig. 4) (22Rubin L.A. Kurman C.C. Biddison W.E. Goldman N.D. Nelson D.L. Hybridoma. 1985; 4: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Wild-type Tac as well as Tac with a C-terminally fused EGFP accumulated apically when expressed in MDCK II cells (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, Tac-SCF chimeras expressing the wild-type cytoplasmic domain of SCF localized to basolateral membranes in a manner identical to the SCF-GFP wild-type constructs (Fig. 4 B). Likewise, constructs involving extracellular Tac with deletion mutations of the cytoplasmic tail of SCF (d29, basolateral, Fig. 4 C; d22, apical, Fig.4 D; d21–28, apical, Fig. 4 E; d5–20, apical (not shown); and d12–20, basolateral/apical, Fig. 4 F), showed identical basolateral sorting behaviors compared with the mutant SCF-GFP constructs. This indicates that the extracellular domain of SCF is not required for basolateral targeting and that the basolateral targeting motif of SCF contained within its cytoplasmic portion is sufficient to direct the Tac extracellular domain basolaterally. Moreover, sequences N-terminal to methionine 25 and leucine 26 removed in the d12–20 mutation influence the efficiency of basolateral targeting (Fig. 4 F). Although it is evident that the leucine residue at position 26 is critical for basolateral targeting it is not known whether a second hydrophobic residue (methionine 25) as found in all di-leucine-like determinants is equally required for basolateral sorting of SCF. Moreover, the region N-terminal to the ML motif which is also required for efficient basolateral targeting (12ENIQINEED20) bears a domain important for SCF sorting as well. To address the first question, we replaced methionine 25 with an alanine residue and analyzed the distribution of the Tac-SCF construct at steady-state conditions. In contrast to the leucine 26 to alanine mutation, the change of methionine 25 to alanine did not affect basolateral targeting of Tac-SCF (Fig. 5,A and B). Moreover, replacement of methionine by leucine in an attempt to create a classical di-leucine determinant led to intracellular and apical localization of Tac-SCF (not shown). Therefore, this finding revealed the existence of a novel type of leucine-based basolateral targeting signal in SCF, which does not require a second hydrophobic amino acid to be functional. Analysis of sequences N-terminal to leucine 26 which are absent in the d12–20 mutation reveal an unusually high concentration of acidic amino acids. An acidic cluster N-terminal to an FI motif has recently been identified as a basolateral targeting signal in the furin protease (25Simmen T. Nobile M. Bonifacino J.S. Hunziker W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3136-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test whether the acidic cluster in SCF contributes to basolateral sorting or whether other acidic amino acid residues localized closely to the leucine residue are critical, we mutated glutamic acid 22 (22EXXML26) to alanine (Fig. 5C). In addition, we replaced glutamic acid 19 with a lysine to destroy the acidic cluster formed by residues18EED20 (Fig. 3 F). Neither modification had any effect on basolateral targeting of Tac or of the GFP chimeric SCF constructs. However, the replacement of all three acidic residues 18, 19, and 20, with alanine residues (E-D18A-A) did alter basolateral sorting of the Tac-SCF chimeras. In clones expressing relatively low amounts of the Tac-E-D18A-A chimera, basolateral targeting was still efficient; however, in clones expressing higher amounts of mutant Tac-SCF, both basolateral and apical surface staining was detected (Fig. 5 D). Anti-Tac staining of these clones strongly resembled the phenotype already seen with the d12–20 mutation (Fig. 4 F). These data suggest that the removal of the acidic cluster (18EED20) is the cause of the phenotype of the d12–20 mutation which results in a reduced efficiency of basolateral transport mediated by the monomeric leucine determinant. SCF belongs to a large family of transmembrane growth factors that play important roles during development, tissue homeostasis, and hematopoiesis. Based on sequence and functional homologies, SCF is most closely related to CSF-1 (26Bazan J.F. Cell. 1991; 65: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The similarities between the two factors extend to their respective receptor tyrosine kinases, c-Fms, the receptor for CSF-1, and c-Kit, the receptor for SCF, which are structurally conserved and which have evolved by chromosomal duplication (27Pawson T. Bernstein A. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 350-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison (Fig.6 E) of the cytoplasmic domain of CSF-1 with that of SCF reveals in addition to the most C-terminal valine residue, a leucine-containing motif at a position comparable to the basolateral targeting domain of SCF. However, the cluster of acidic amino acids N-terminal to this leucine motif is not conserved in CSF-1. To determine the basolateral sorting activities of CSF-1, we expressed the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic tail domains fused to the extracellular domain of Tac and studied its steady-state distribution in confluent monolayers of MDCK II cells (Fig. 6). The wild-type Tac-CSF-1 chimeric construct was expressed on the basolateral surface of MDCK II cells (Fig. 6 C). However, a considerable amount of Tac-CSF-1 was also detected on the apical surface of confluent MDCK II cells (Fig. 6 C′), a situation unlike the one observed with wild-type Tac-SCF chimeras (Fig. 6 A and A′). The distribution of Tac-CSF-1 on basolateral as well as apical surfaces gave the impression that this construct is not sorted. To determine whether the homologous leucine in CSF-1 can interact with the sorting machinery of the cell, we mutated leucine 24 of CSF-1 to alanine. The respective Tac chimera (Tac-CSF-L24A) accumulated apically (Fig.6 D′), similar to Tac-SCF-L26A (Fig. 6 D′), suggesting that the leucine at the respective position in CSF-1 is nevertheless recognized as a basolateral sorting signal but that the efficiency of basolateral transport is lower compared with that of wild-type SCF. This difference may depend on the presence of the acidic cluster in SCF which is absent from CSF-1. Many basolateral sorting determinants have been shown to induce endocytosis, for example the basolateral targeting motif (ML) in the invariant chain of the major histocompatibility complex II also mediates endocytosis of the respective proteins (11Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Simonsen A. Stang E. Bremnes B. Roe M. Prydz K. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 597-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the wild-type cytoplasmic tails of SCF, expressed as a Tac chimera (Tac-SCF), are able to internalize Tac-SCF·anti-Tac complexes in nonpolarized COS-7 cells. Anti-Tac antibodies were bound to transfected cells in the cold. Subsequently, Tac-SCF·anti-Tac antibody complexes were allowed to internalize at 37 °C and visualized after acid removal of cell surface remaining anti-Tac antibodies. Wild-type Tac-SCF-expressing cells (Fig.7 B) as well as cells expressing various C-terminal deletions encompassing the basolateral sorting signal showed a similar low amount of internalized anti-Tac antibodies (not shown). This suggests that the mono-leucine determinant in SCF does not induce endocytosis, a finding that is consistent with the persistent cell surface expression of membrane-bound SCF. In contrast to wild-type SCF, GFP and Tac-SCF chimeras containing the cytoplasmic tail of the Mgf Sl17H mutation accumulated in intracellular vesicular structures (Tac-SCF-17H, Fig. 7 D; see also Ref. 8Wehrle-Haller B. Weston J.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This intracellular accumulation of the mutant constructs could be the result of retention of newly synthesized chimeric proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum as suggested by Briley and colleagues (29Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or of endocytosis of cell surface SCF. To determine, whether the intracellular steady-state localization of Tac-SCF-17H in polarized MDCK II was the result of endocytosis (Fig.7 D), we compared the localization with that of Tac-tyr. Tyrosinase is a protein that carries an established signal for endocytosis and lysosomal/melanosomal targeting and is therefore constitutively internalized from the cell surface (30Simmen T. Schmidt A. Hunziker W. Beermann F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in polarized MDCK II cells, Tac-tyr localized to intracellular vesicular structures (Fig. 7 G), resembling the staining seen for the Tac-SCF-17H construct (Fig. 7 D).

Furthermore, mutation of the leucine residues (Leu21-Leu22), which are part of this putative motif in Mgf Sl17H to alanines, resulted in the loss of intracellular but led to apical accumulation of Tac-17H-LLAA in polarized MDCK cells (Fig. 7 J).

Irie M. Carsana A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1988; 51: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and is also known as RNase-2 or RNase Us. EDN was initially identified by its ability to induce the Gordon phenomenon (muscle stiffness, ataxia, incoordination, and spasmodic paralysis) when injected into rabbits (4Fredens K. Dahl R. Venge P. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1982; 70: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Gleich G.J. Adolphson C.R. Adv. Immunol. 1986; 39: 177-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Its neurotoxic effect is achieved through a selective killing of cerebellar Purkinje cells (6Durack D.T. Ackerman S.J. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5165-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The protein also displays cytotoxicity against helminths, single-stranded RNA viruses, and respiratory epithelial cells; and a role as a host defense protein has been suggested (7Rosenberg H.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Damage of host tissues by EDN could contribute to the secondary effects associated with inflammatory disorders and hypereosinophilic syndromes (8Snyder M.R. Gleich G.J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 425-444Crossref Google Scholar). EDN shares 36% amino acid identity with RNase A and 67% identity with a related eosinophil RNase, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP, also known as RNase-3) (7Rosenberg H.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). EDN′s enzymatic activity is essential for its neurotoxic, helminthotoxic, and antiviral activities (9Sorrentino S. Glitz D.G.

Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The topology of the EDN molecule includes the RNase A fold and core ribonucleolytic active site architecture (14Gilliland G. D'Allesio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 305-341Crossref Google Scholar), which is conserved among all these molecules, although both ECP (15Boix E. Leonidas D.D. Nikolovski Z. Nogués M.V. Cuchillo C.M. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16794-16801Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and EDN exhibit significant differences at the peripheral substrate-binding sites (16Boix E. Nikolovski Z.

The core of the catalytic site of RNase A consists of subsites B1, P1, and B2. These subsites accommodate the phosphate where phosphodiester bond cleavage occurs (P1) and the nucleotide bases on the 3′ and 5′ sides of the scissile bond (B1 and B2, respectively) (17Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Enzymes. 1971; 4: 647-806Crossref Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies (18Boix E. Nogues M.V. Schein C.H. Benner S.A. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol.

P0 interacts with the 5′-phosphate of a nucleotide base bound at B1 and P2 interacts with the 3′-phosphate of a nucleotide base bound at B2 (for recent reviews see Refs. 20Nogués M.V. Moussaoui M. Boix E. Vilanova M. Ribo M. Cuchillo C.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Cuchillo C.M. Vilanova M. Nogues M. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F.

The three main catalytic residues of RNase A (His-12, Lys-41, and His-119 of the P1 subsite) are present in EDN as His-15, Lys-38, and His-129. The key B1 residues, Thr-45 and Phe-120 in RNase A, are also maintained in EDN as Thr-42 and Leu-130, but the other components of this subsite differ. The B2 subsite is partially conserved between EDN and RNase A, but subsites P0 and P2 are not. Although EDN and RNase A bind only pyrimidines at B1 and prefer purines at B2, differences in B1 and B2 site structures give rise to subtle changes in substrate specificity. With polynucleotide substrates, EDN has a 20-fold preference for cytidine over uridine; with dinucleotide substrates, EDN has a 2-fold preference for cytidine at B1 and a 100-fold preference for adenosine at B2 (9Sorrentino S. Glitz D.G. Hamann K.J. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.A. Gleich G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14859-14865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two sulfate anions were found in the EDN·sulfate complex structure (13Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) occupying two distinct subsites. One of these is subsite P1, whereas the other is a site not identified in the structure of RNase A, suggested to correspond to a new P−1 phosphate-binding subsite. The biological properties attributed to EDN have been related to its ribonucleolytic activity (7Rosenberg H.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The analysis of its substrate specificity and the identification of the residues involved in substrate interaction would help in understanding its mechanism of action. In addition, the identification of nucleotide-based inhibitors may lead to therapeutic agents for use against the pathological conditions associated with eosinophil RNases. Here we present the first structures of recombinant EDN-nucleotide complexes (at 1.8-Å resolution) and make a detailed comparison with the EDN·sulfate structure at higher resolution (1.6 Å) than the previous reported structure (13Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The structures of the complexes have revealed a detailed picture of critical residues involved in the P1 and B2substrate-binding sites and their flexibility in interaction with different adenylic nucleotides. The analysis of the sulfate-containing structure and comparison with the nucleotide complexes also confirm the presence of a previously suggested P−1 subsite for EDN (13Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, kinetic results suggest that these nucleotides can serve as a starting point toward the design of potent inhibitors of EDN. Uridylyl-3′,5′-adenosine (UpA) was from ICN Biochemicals. Adenosine-5′-diphosphate (5′-ADP), adenosine 2′,5′-diphosphate (2′,5′-ADP) and adenosine-3′,5′-diphosphate (3′,5′-ADP) were from Sigma Chemical Co. Recombinant EDN was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (13Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Newton D.L. Nicholls P. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26739-26745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a synthetic gene for human EDN was cloned into the pET11c expression vector, and the protein was purified from inclusion bodies. The recombinant EDN, which contains an additional methionine residue at the N terminus, has the same specific activity as the protein purified from the natural host (23Newton D.L. Nicholls P. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26739-26745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not have the post-translational modifications that are present in EDN isolated from human body fluids. Crystals of recombinant EDN were grown using the hanging drop/vapor diffusion method from drops containing 9 mg/ml protein in 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.75 mammonium sulfate, and 2.5% ethanol. Drops were equilibrated against reservoirs containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5), 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, and 5% ethanol. Single crystals appeared after 3–4 days at 16 °C. The EDN crystals diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing of 1.6 Å on a Synchrotron radiation source at 100 K using a cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 1.3 m sodium potassium tartrate, and 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The systematic absences and symmetry were consistent with the space groupP212121 with the following unit cell dimensions: a = 53.4 Å,b = 57.2 Å, and c = 42.2 Å. There is one EDN molecule per crystallographic asymmetric unit, and ∼50% of the crystal volume is occupied by solvent. The EDN·2′,5′-ADP, EDN·3′,5′-ADP, and EDN·5′-ADP complexes were obtained by soaking native EDN crystals with 100 mm 2′,5′-ADP, 3′,5′-ADP, or 5′-ADP for at least 2 days prior to data collection. Because the native crystals were grown in the presence of ammonium sulfate, sulfate ions were expected to bind at the active site of EDN as observed previously (13Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hence, prior to soaking, EDN crystals were transferred to 1–2 ml of a solution containing 1.5 m sodium potassium tartrate, 5% ethanol, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, for at least 2 days to remove the bound sulfate ions. Diffraction data for the EDN·sulfate complex were collected to 1.6-Å resolution at 100 K using the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury (UK) on station PX 9.5 using a MAR300 image plate and also at the Protein Diffraction Beamline at Ellettra-Trieste (Italy) using a MAR345 image plate. Data for the EDN·2′,5′-ADP, EDN·3′,5′-ADP, and EDN·5′-ADP complexes were collected (at 1.8 Å) in-house at 100 K using a MAR300 image plate mounted on an Enraf-Nonius rotating anode x-ray source with CuKα radiation. Raw data images were indexed, integrated, and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects using the program DENZO (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38594) Google Scholar). All data were scaled and merged using the program SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38594) Google Scholar). Intensities were then truncated to amplitudes by the TRUNCATE program (25French S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (895) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab All crystallographic refinement was carried out using the program X-PLOR 3.851 (26Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) with the published structure of EDN·sulfate (13Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) value was monitored throughout refinement. Several rounds of refinement, model building, individualB-factor refinement, and bulk solvent correction as implemented in X-PLOR 3.851 (28Jiang J.-S. Brünger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) were performed until theRfree value for every model could not be improved any further. During the final stages of refinement, water molecules were inserted into the model at positions corresponding to peaks in the ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ electron density maps with heights greater than 3ς and at hydrogen bond forming distances from appropriate atoms. 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖φcalc maps were also used to verify the presence of the peaks. Water molecules with a temperature factor higher than 65 Å2 were excluded from subsequent refinement steps. In the case of EDN·ligand complexes, the ligand molecule was included during the final stages of refinement. The details of refinement are given in TableI. The program PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to assess the quality of the final structure. Analysis of the Ramachandran (ϕ − ψ) plot (30CCP4, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 1994, 760, 763.Google Scholar) showed that all residues lie in the allowed regions. RNase activity of EDN was measured by a spectrophotometric method. Assays were carried out in 0.2 m MES·NaOH, pH 6.5, at 25 °C using 0.5-cm path length cells. UpA was used as a substrate. Substrate and inhibitor concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficient: ε261 = 23,500m−1 cm−1 for UpA (31Imazawa M. Irie M. Ukita T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1968; 64: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and ε259 = 15,400 m−1cm−1 for 5′-ADP, 2′,5′-ADP, and 3′,5′-ADP (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The activity was measured by following the initial reaction velocities using the difference molar absorbance coefficient Δε286= 570 m−1 cm−1 for the transphosphorylation reaction of UpA (33Moiseev G.P. Bocharov A.L. Mamaeva O.K. Yakolev G.J. Bioorg. Khim. 1982; 8: 1197-1206Google Scholar). Ki was determined by the Dixon method (34Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar) using three different substrate concentrations from 0.15 to 0.4 mm of UpA, and eight inhibitor concentrations from 5 to 400 μm; 1/vo, where vo is the initial velocity, was plotted against the inhibitor concentration [I] (data not shown). The final atomic coordinates for the four complexes of EDN (sulfate, 2′,5′-ADP, 3′,5′-ADP, and 5′-ADP) have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1HI2, 1HI3,1HI4, and 1HI5, respectively). The structures of EDN detailed here are very similar to the EDN·sulfate structure reported previously (13Mosimann S.C. Newton D.L. Youle R.J. James M.N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 540-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. difference between Cα atoms in the two sulfate-bound structures is 0.15 Å. The corresponding values for the EDN·3′,5′-ADP, EDN·2′,5′-ADP, and EDN·5′-ADP complexes are 0.31, 0.29, and 0.28 Å, respectively. In the present EDN·sulfate structure, the additional methionine (Met-0) residue from the recombinant protein was observed. In all free RNase A structures reported so far, the side-chain of His-119, which is part of the catalytic triad, was found in two conformations (A and B with χ1 = 150° and χ1 = −60°, respectively) (35Borkakoti N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36deMel V.S.J. Martin P.D. Doscher M.S. Edwards B.F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 247-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conformation A is compatible with nucleotide binding (37Zegers I. Maes D. Dao-Thi M.-H. Poortmans F. Palmer R. Wyns L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10287-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) whereas low pH or the presence of sulfate/phosphate in the active site favors conformation B (40Fedorov A.A. Joseph-McCarthy D. Fedorov E. Sirakova D. Graf I. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15962-15979Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Berisio R. Lamzin V.S. Sica F. Wilson K.S. Zagari A.

Biol. 2000; 297: 713-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The side chain of the corresponding EDN residue, His-129, is in conformation B in the EDN·sulfate (χ1 = −67°), EDN·2′,5′-ADP (χ1 = −65°), and EDN·5′-ADP (χ1 = −74°) complex structures, whereas in the EDN·3′,5′-ADP (χ1 = 152°) complex structure it is in conformation A. The r.m.s. differences between the Cα atoms of the structures of the present 1.6-Å resolution EDN·sulfate complex and those of the 3′,5′-ADP, 2′,5′-ADP, and 5′-ADP complexes are 0.29, 0.27, and 0.27 Å, respectively. The corresponding values within the complexes, 3′,5′-ADP against 2′,5′-ADP and 5′-ADP are 0.27 and 0.31 Å, respectively, whereas the r.m.s. difference between the 2′,5′-ADP and the 5′-ADP complexes is 0.18 Å. The differences between the four protein structures are very small, concentrated in the loop regions, and seemingly unrelated to the presence of the different inhibitors. The EDN·sulfate structure, determined at 1.6-Å resolution, contains 152 water molecules. The structures of the 3′,5′-ADP, 2′,5′-ADP, and 5′-ADP complexes are at a slightly lower resolution (1.8 Å) and contain 123, 110, and 132 water molecules, respectively. The residues at the active site are oriented similarly in all four complexes, with the exception of His 129 (noted above), and there are no significant conformational changes due to inhibitor binding. A numbering scheme and torsion angle definitions are shown in Fig.1 using 5′-diphosphoadenosine 3′-phosphate (ppA- 3′-p) as a reference molecule (38Leonidas D.D. Shapiro R. Irons L.I. Russo N. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5578-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for the three adenylic mononucleotides. The 3′,5′-ADP molecule is reasonably well defined in the electron density map (Fig.2 A). The conformation of 3′,5′-ADP when bound to EDN is very similar to that observed previously for B2-bound adenosine in the complexes of RNase A with d(pA)4 (43McPherson A. Brayer G. Cascio D. Williams R. Science. 1986; 2: 765-768Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), d(ApTpApApG) (44Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The glycosyl torsion angle χ adopts theanti-conformation, whereas the ribose is at theC2′-endo conformation. The γ torsion angle is in the unusual sp range (TableII), but its value (−29°) is very close to the highly favorable −sc region (−30° to −90°) (46Moodie S.L. Thornton J.M.

EDN and 3′,5′-ADP engage in seven hydrogen-bond interactions, and three water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the inhibitor (TableIII). The 5′-phosphate binds to subsite P1 (the distance between the phosphorous to sulfur of the SO42− (A) of EDN·sulfate complex is 0.3 Å) and is involved in hydrogen bond interactions with the imidazole rings of His-15 and His-129.

https://openalex.org/W2037745595,"The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression are cell cycle dependent. We used a serum-starved human foreskin fibroblast model to determine changes in COX-2 mRNA, protein, and promoter activity in response to stimulation with interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at G0, G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. IL-1b (1 ng/ml) and PMA (100 nM) induced robust COX-2 expression in the G0 cells, and the level of COX-2 expression declined progressively after the cells had entered the cell cycle. The COX-2 mRNA level at G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was 76%, 46%, and 30% of that at G0, respectively. A 5-flanking promoter fragment of COX-2 constructed into a luciferase expression vector was transfected into cells. The promoter activity in response to PMA stimulation was significantly higher in G0 than in S phase cells. These results imply that G0 cells are the key players in inflammation and other COX-2-dependent pathophysiological processes. When the cells are in the proliferative phase, COX-2 inducibility becomes restrained probably by an endogenous control mechanism to avoid COX-2 mediated oxidative DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2079031769,"Novel members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family were identified in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells utilizing a homology-cloning strategy. Four novel mRNA transcripts could be identified as isoforms of the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoEr2): one form lacking three ligand binding repeats (nucleotides 497–883) but containing a novel ligand binding repeat adjacent to a unique cysteine-rich domain preceding the epidermal growth factor precursor domain of apoEr2, forms lacking the O-linked sugar domain, and forms containing a 59-amino acid deletion within the cytoplasmic tail. By fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosome mapping, we could confirm that the novel alternative forms of apoEr2 are splice variants of transcripts from a single copy gene on chromosome 1p34. To analyze whether the different splice variants of apoEr2 mRNA are expressed in a splice variant-specific pattern, we concentrated on the central nervous system, where high expression of apoEr2 has been described originally. By means of splice variant-specific in situ hybridization, we could confirm that apoEr2 mRNA is abundantly expressed in brain tissue and, with exception of the newly identified ligand binding domain, all mRNA splice variants exhibited a similar expression pattern.

Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and that VLDLR expression is restricted to smooth muscle cells (SMC) and ECs in specific vascular compartments (14Wyne K.L. Pathak K. Seabra M.C. Hobbs H.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we speculated that additional members of the LDLR family might exist on ECs. For this purpose we designed a PCR-based homology-cloning strategy utilizing conserved structural elements within the LDLR family. Such elements are (i) the ligand binding domains containing the characteristic amino acid motif Ser-Asp-Glu (SDE) within the variable number of ligand binding repeats, (ii) the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor homology domains containing several Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (YWTD) consensus tetrapeptides, and (iii) the cytoplasmic region. Applying this cloning strategy, we have cloned novel members of the LDLR family and identified these as splice variants of apoEr2 (15Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H. Suzuki H.

To elucidate possible functional implications of these splice variants of apoEr2, we studied the splice-specific mRNA expression pattern in the brain, where apoEr2 was reported to be expressed abundantly and splice variant-specific expression was already described (16Clatworthy A.E.

We found that the mRNA splice variant containing the newly identified ligand binding domain was expressed in brain only in vascular cells, whereas all other mRNA splice variants were found to be expressed in neuronal tissue in a similar pattern. low density lipoprotein receptor apolipoprotein E receptor 2 LDLR-related protein very low density lipoprotein receptor smooth muscle cells epidermal growth factor endothelial cells human umbilical vein EC human skin microvascular EC polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) Poly(A+) RNA was extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human foreskin microvascular endothelial cells (HSMEC), and human arterial SMC, isolated, and cultured as described (17Gimbrone M.A. Cotran R.

First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of mRNA at 42 °C using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the degenerate oligonucleotide LDLRF31 (5′-GTGGTYTTCIIRTASACRGGRTTGTCAAAGTT-3′ (Y = C + T, R = A + G, S = G + C), corresponding to nucleotides 2477–2509 2Nucleotide numbering corresponds to the sequence shown in Fig. 2. of human LDLR, 2604–2636 of human VLDLR, 13967–13999 of human LRP, and 13920–13952 of rat gp330 (18Saito A.

Samples were adjusted to PCR buffer conditions in a total volume of 50 μl with 30 pmol of primer LDLRF31 and 30 pmol of LDLRF50 (5′-CCIGMIGSIMTIGCWGTKGAYTGG-3′ (M = A + C, W = A + T, K = G + T), reverse complementary to nucleotides 1439–1463 of LDLR, 1656–1680 of VLDLR, 9776–9800 of LRP, and 9942–9966 of gp330), employing 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.1 unit of PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hot start PCR (Thermal Cycler 2400, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was performed for 30 cycles under the following conditions: 40 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 62 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C. Amplified products were separated on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Products were purified using the QIAEX DNA gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and analyzed by DNA sequencing with a model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). In the course of the subsequent cloning of the 5′ sequence we used the degenerate sense primer LDLRF51 (5′-GACTGCGSIGAYGGITCIGAYGAG-3′) corresponding to the amino acid motif SDE and the specific antisense primer 5 (5′-CTGAGATGGTCTTATTGCCCGAG-3′, nucleotides 1494–1516). Amplification was performed as above. The 5′- and 3′-ends were identified from HUVEC and HSMEC mRNAs by a rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol using the Marathon kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For that purpose, the antisense primer 15 (5′-CTGGAAGCCTGCTGGGCACGT-3′, nucleotides 1033–1053) was employed for 5′-adaptor amplification, and the sense primer was employed for C5 (5′-CTCAACAGTCACTGCCGCTGTTATC-3′, nucleotides 2409–2433) for 3′ adaptor amplification. Both strands of PCR products, in each case from three independent amplifications, were completely sequenced. Six μg of mRNAs from cultured HUVEC, HSMEC, or SMC were electrophoresed on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%) and transferred to a nylon membrane (Duralon UV, Stratagene). Blotting, prehybridization, and hybridization were performed according to standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized utilizing 32P-labeled DNA probes corresponding to nucleotides 1444–2558 of apoEr2906 (Fig. 2), nucleotides 1439–2509 of LDLR, nucleotides 1656–2604 of VLDLR, and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The probes were labeled by random priming to a specific activity of 1 × 10 9cpm/μg using [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the DNA-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prehybridization was performed for 2 h at 57 °C and hybridization overnight at 57 °C. Blots were washed at a final stringency of 1× SSC (0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5% SDS at 60 °C. Blots were exposed to autoradiography film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chromosomal localization of the transcripts was determined by fluorescence in situhybridization (20Lichter P. Tang C.J.C.T. Call K. Hermanson G. Evans G.A,. Hausman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) using nucleotides 1444–2558 of apoEr2906 as a probe. The probe was labeled with biotinylated-dUTP using a standard nick translation protocol and hybridized to chromosomes isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Probe detection was performed using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies. To further define the regional localization, chromosome banding was performed (21Schweizer D. Ambros P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 97-112PubMed Google Scholar). A series of primers distinguishing the apoEr2 isoforms by size were utilized to analyze cell type-specific expression. Primer positions are indicated in Fig. 4. Each experiment was carried out with outer primers for the first amplification and inner primers for nested PCR. Outer primer pairs were primer A (5′-AAGGACTGCGAGGGTGGAGCG-3′, nucleotides 454–474) and primer B (5′ -CCAGCAACCAAACATCTTCTG-3′, nucleotides 3093–3114). Primer L5 (5′-ACATGTGTCCTTGCAATCAAGCAC-3′, nucleotides 541–565) and primer L3 (5′-GGATGGACAAGCTCTTAGCAC-3′, nucleotides 938–959), primer O5 (5′-ATCTGGGCTCAACGGTGTGGAC-3′, nucleotides 1653–1671) and primer O3 (5′-GGCTATCACCACTATGGGCACG-3′, nucleotides 2441–2463), primer C5 and primer C3 5′-GATCCCATCCTCAGGGTAGTCC-3′, nucleotides 2829–2851) were utilized as inner primers. cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from cultured HUVEC, HSMEC, SMC, and systemic artery mRNAs, respectively. Oligo(dT) primers served as templates for PCR amplification (40 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 58 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C, 25 cycles). Negative controls in the absence of reverse transcriptase were included in the analysis. All products were sequenced. To confirm alternative splicing of the novel sequences at the level of genomic DNA, we used primer pair L5 and 155 (5′-GAGGGTCAGAGCAGAAAGTGTC-3′, nucleotides 833–854 of apoEr2906) employing 250 ng of human chromosomal DNA purified from peripheral blood lymphocytes (QIAamp blood kit, Qiagen) as PCR template. Nonradioactive in situhybridization was performed on cryosections (7 μm) of neuronal tissues obtained from a rhesus monkey tissue bank (22Breuss J.M. Gillett N. Lu L. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1521-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Three riboprobes covering specific regions of the new splice variants of the human apoEr2 mRNA found by us (Fig. 4) were transcribed from the respective vectors and designated as 1) “ligand binding repeat region” (nucleotides 616–956; 340 base pairs long), 2) “O-linked sugar domain region” (nucleotides 2085–2310; 225 base pairs long long), and 3) “cytoplasmatic tail region” (nucleotides 2629–2809; 180 base pairs long) using the digoxigenin-RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In brief, slides were fixed in buffered, freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min and then incubated in PBS containing 100 mm glycine and PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After a short washing step with PBS, sections were digested for 30 min at 37 °C with TE buffer (100 mm Tris-HCL, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml RNase-free proteinase K. Sections were again postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and treated in triethanolamine/acetic anhydride solution (0.1m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, containing 0.25% acetic anhydride) on a rocking platform. After another PBS washing step, the slides were wiped dry around the tissue and laid out flat in airtight boxes on top of filter paper soaked in box buffer (4× SSC, 50% formamide). Each section was covered with 20 μl of prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCL, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mg/ml heparin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, and Denhardt's solution). 7 μl of riboprobe in 40 μl of hybridization buffer were added to each section and incubated for 16 h at 52 °C. Hybridization was followed by two washes (10 min each) at room temperature in wash buffer (2× SSC, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA). Slides were then immersed in RNase A solution (20 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed again twice in wash buffer at room temperature then for 2 h in wash buffer containing 0.1× SSC at 55 °C. Detection of the labeled and hybridized probe was performed using the DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by incubation for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin Fab fragment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1:700 in 0.1% goat serum, Tris-buffered saline at room temperature); the signal was developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. Consecutive sections were analyzed the three different antisense probes as well as the respective sense probe as control for nonspecific hybridization. The degenerate upstream primer LDLRF31, corresponding to the coated pit signal Asn-Pro-Val-Tyr (NPVY) within the cytoplasmic tail (23Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the degenerate downstream primer LDLRF50, corresponding to the tetrapeptide sequence Ala-Val-Asp-Trp (AVDW) within the EGF precursor domain, were used for initial reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments. Inosine was utilized in each position having more than two bases degeneracy. Using this strategy, a LDLR fragment of 1070 bp and a VLDLR fragment of 980 bp were readily identified in cultured HUVEC, HSMEC, and SMC. In all three cell types, two new PCR fragments (1115 and 889 bp) were obtained (Product 1 and Product 2 in Fig.1 A). The fragment corresponding to LRP (4200 bp) could only be detected in SMC utilizing a semi-nested PCR strategy (data not shown). All four PCR products shown in Fig. 1 A were sequenced and confirmed as LDLR and VLDLR, respectively, containing the 84-bp O-linked sugar domain (VLDLR-2). The two novel fragments with partial sequence identity carried an open reading frame corresponding to an EGF precursor region with YWTD motifs and a transmembrane domain. The two clones differed by 225 bp upstream of the transmembrane domain that were similar to the O-linked sugar domain of LDLR and VLDLR. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B) utilizing the 1115-bp fragment as a probe yielded multiple transcripts corresponding to the 4.5, 3.9, and 3.6-kb mRNA species, respectively, in HUVEC, HSMEC, and SMC. In comparison, the VLDLR probe hybridized to a 4.0- and a 5.5-kb transcript and the LDLR probe to a 5.3-kb transcript, which were all distinct from the transcripts detected with the 1115-bp probe. Amplification of the 5′-end was achieved by combining the degenerate downstream primer LDLRF51 corresponding to the SDE sequence within the ligand binding region and a specific upstream primer (primer 5) overlapping the novel sequence by 80 bp. Using the 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique with specific primers 90 bp downstream and 150 bp upstream of the sequence, the missing 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA were identified. One large open reading frame was identified coding for a protein with 906 amino acids and corresponding to a calculated molecular mass of 100 kDa (Fig. 2). The sequence was partially identical to sequences of the originally described apoEr2. The new sequence found was different from apoEr2922 by lacking repeats 4–6 of the ligand binding domain and containing additional sequences homologous to ligand binding repeat 8 of VLDLR and an additional cysteine-rich region with no homology to any sequence of a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. To clarify the nature of the various forms with partial identity to apoEr2, genomic analysis was performed using nucleotides 1444–2558 of apoEr2 common to all forms (Fig. 3). This sequence could be localized as a single copy on human chromosome 1p32 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Fig. 3). Kim et al. (24Kim D.H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C. Kim H.J. Suzuki H.

Exon 6 of apoEr2 was found to be separated from the novel exon 6a by a ∼0.75-kb intron. Both the ligand binding repeat 8 and the novel cysteine-rich region of apoEr2906 are encoded by this exon located within the 3.7-kb intron region identified by Kim et al. (24Kim D.H. Magoori K.

Protein domains in alignment with the exon organization are shown in Fig. 4. In theory, 12 apoEr2 isoforms could result from the combinations of the various alternative regions. The shortest apoEr2 mRNA isoform apoEr2659encodes four ligand binding repeats, an EGF precursor domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic region (isoform not shown in Fig. 4). The apoEr2906 variant consists of five ligand binding repeats, the novel cysteine-rich domain, an EGF precursor domain, an O-linked sugar domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region. Additional alternative forms of apoEr2, for example isoforms containing the O-linked sugar domain and the 59-amino acid deletion within the cytoplasmic region, are shown in Fig. 4. The isoforms apoEr2718 and apoEr2 apoEr2734, both lacking the ligand binding repeat 4–6, were also described recently by Clatworthy et al.(16Clatworthy A.E. Stockinger W. Christie R.H. Schneider W.J. Nimopf J. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To analyze which splice variants are actually expressed in different tissues, a reverse transcriptase-PCR strategy with several primer combinations as presented in Fig.5 A was used. Splicing-mediated insertion or deletion of sequence(s) is revealed by generation of multiple PCR fragments of different sizes (Fig. 5 B). As expected, mRNA of the novel ligand binding repeat and the novel cysteine-rich domain were present in HUVEC, HSMEC, and also in SMC and placenta, whereas none of the other tissues contained these alternative regions. HUVEC and SMC were found to express an apoEr2 mRNA isoform containing the novel cysteine-rich region but not the novel ligand binding repeat (Fig. 5 B, 1, apoEr2710as shown in Fig. 4). In brain and placenta, the predominant products contained the O-linked sugar domain, whereas in heart, an exclusive PCR product lacking the O-linked sugar domain was detected (Fig. 5B, 2). Both alternate cytoplasmic forms were identified in placenta. In heart, the predominant mRNA product contained the 59-amino acid insertion, whereas in brain, the shorter product was detected (Fig. 5 B, 3). ApoEr2 mRNA containing the cytoplasmic region without the 59-amino acid insertion and the isoform with and the isoform lacking theO-linked sugar domain was identified in coronary arteries from healthy individuals (data not shown). To support the tissue PCR data by an independent method, we used in situ hybridization specific for different splice variants of apoEr2 mRNA. We chose brain tissue because of the high apoEr2 expression in human brain observed by our own Northern analysis and because of the existing in situ hybridization data for the rat brain (15Kim D.H.

Rebeck G.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and mouse brain (25Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Cerebral tissue sections of rhesus monkey were employed together with digoxigenin-labeled probes specific for the different splice variants of apoEr2 mRNA. We could detect the same differences in the expression pattern between the different splice forms of the apoEr2 mRNAs as revealed from PCR experiments. Fig.6 shows the expression pattern for the riboprobes specific for the newly identified ligand binding domain, theO-linked sugar domain, and the cytoplasmic tail in the central nervous system (Fig. 6, A–C). Using the riboprobe specific for the new ligand-binding site (Fig. 6 A), we could not detect any signal in neuronal tissue but only strong expression in vascular cells (inset). We observed a similar mRNA expression pattern using the other two riboprobes specific for theO-linked sugar domain (Fig. 6 B) and the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 6 C), for which large and small neurons were found to be positive. In vessels, the endothelium expressed all three splice variants analyzed in a similar pattern (insets in Fig. 6, A–C). The negative control using a sense strand probe was always found negative (not shown). In other parts of the brain (not shown), the O-linked sugar domain and the cytoplasmic tail but not the new ligand binding domain were found positive in several types of cells. In the cerebellum Purkinje cells, the large neurons located at the border of the granular and the molecular layer expressed high levels, whereas the basket cells and the granule cells show low levels of these two apoER2 mRNA variants. Furthermore the oligodendrocytes in the white matter expressed low levels of these two splice variants of the apoEr2 mRNA. In search for novel members of the LDLR family in vascular tissue, we found several hitherto unknown mRNA transcripts using a homology-cloning strategy. Analyzing the origin of these novel transcripts, they were found to be splice variants of the apoEr2 (15Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H. Suzuki H. Kondo H. Saeki S. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8373-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Theoretically, 12 apoEr2 isoforms could result from the combinations of the various alternative regions. ApoEr2906 lacks ligand binding repeats 4–6 (nucleotides 497–883 of apoE2) and, therefore, the short linker region between ligand binding repeats 5 and 6, thought to be required for low density lipoprotein binding by LDLR (8Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is absent. The fifth ligand binding repeat of apoEr2906exhibits the highest homology (55%) to ligand binding repeat 8 of VLDLR. A comparable ligand binding repeat has recently been described within the chicken lipoprotein receptor LR8B (27Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which has high sequence homology to apoEr2. The cysteine-rich domain of apoEr2906 is a novel sequence with no homology to any known protein. It is important to note that these two regions each contain an odd number of cysteines (n = 5), suggesting tertiary structural disulfide bridge formation. Another AG nucleotide sequence within exon 6a gives rise to a possible additional alternative spliced variant with a truncated cysteine-rich region encoding for four cysteines (not shown). Whether new motifs with new ligand binding properties result from formation of disulfide bonds between cysteines of adjacent domains in addition to the possible variation in ligand binding properties caused by alternative splicing remains to be determined. Data from fluorescence in situhybridization localizing apoEr2 on chromosome 1p32 indicate that the novel alternative transcripts and the original apoEr2 mRNA are alternatively spliced variants of the same gene locus, since Kimet al (24Kim D.H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C. Kim H.J. Suzuki H. Fujita T. Endo Y. Saeki S. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol.

Previously published data have already indicated alternative splicing of the O-linked sugar domain of VLDLR (28Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and chicken lipoprotein receptor 8 (LR8) (27Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol.

Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of apoEr2 contains motifs that have previously been described in human gp330 (29Hjälm G. Murray E. Crumley G. Harazim W. Lundgren S. Onyango I. Ek B. Larsson M. Juhlin C. Hellman P. Davis H. Akerström G. Rask L. Morse B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The alternatively spliced cytoplasmic region of human apoEr2 contains the amino acid sequence motifs LPGEPRS and LPKNPLS, with two potential Src homology 3 binding regions (30Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Paeson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 31Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), indicating a possible intracellular signaling through these sites. In contrast, these motifs are not present in LDLR, VLDLR, or LRP. Our data revealed by in situ hybridization confirm and expand with single cell resolution earlier results by Kim et al. (15Kim D.H.

The data are also consistent with results on normal mouse embryo brain, published by Trommsdorff et al. (26Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and with the detection of apoEr2 in human brain (16Clatworthy A.E. Stockinger W. Christie R.H. Schneider W.J. Nimopf J. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These authors also could not detect splice variants containing the ligand binding domain 4–6 of apoEr2 within the brain, consistent with our data. To assure that comparable parts of tissue were analyzed, consecutive sections were used for the three different riboprobes and the respective sense controls. In conclusion, we have identified a family of new isoforms of apoEr2 mRNAs originating from alternative splicing. The restriction of the expression of a mRNA isoform coding for a new ligand binding domain in brain tissue to vascular cells could indicate possible binding of a specific ligand only to vascular cells but not to neuronal tissue. This could indicate a specific function of this splice variant in vascular cells or, alternatively, disruption of the vascular cell-specific expression and expression also in neuronal tissue and, in turn, uptake of a novel ligand into neuronal cells normally not internalized could contribute to brain pathologies (15Kim D.H.

https://openalex.org/W2165449619,"Recently, we demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inhibits the internalization of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and the EGF-induced mono-ubiquitination of EGF receptor pathway substrate clone #15 (Eps15) in fibroblasts. In addition, it was suggested that EGF receptor internalization might be inhibited by H2O2 by inhibition of ubiquitination of proteins involved in endocytosis. Here, we show that H2O2 also inhibits the poly-ubiquitination of the EGF receptor in fibroblasts. Furthermore, recovery of the cells resulted in re-establishment of ubiquitination of both the EGF receptor and Eps15 and coincided with restoration of internalization of those receptors that had bound EGF in the presence of H2O2. In addition, EGF receptor internalization was inhibited by the sulphydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), indicating that intact SH groups might be required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, H2O2 rapidly induced an increase in the cellular ratio of GSSG:GSH (oxidized glutathione:reduced glutathione) and removal of H2O2 resulted in a fast restoration of the ratio of GSSG:GSH. Therefore, these results suggest a relation between the inhibition of internalization ubiquitination and an increase in GSSG:GSH ratio, which strengthens the hypothesis that H2O2 inhibits EGF receptor internalization by an inhibition of ubiquitination of proteins involved in EGF receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2136070690,"Activation of smooth muscle myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) causes contraction. Here we have proven that MLCK controls Ca2+ entry (CE) in endothelial cells (ECs): MLCK antisense oligonucleotides strongly prevented bradykinin (BK)- and thapsigargin (TG)-induced endothelial Ca2+ response, while MLCK sense did not. We also show that the relevant mechanism is not phosphorylation of myosin light-chain (MLC): MLC phosphorylation by BK required CE, but MLC phosphorylation caused by the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A did not trigger Ca2+ response. Most important, we provide for the first time strong evidence that, in contrast to its role in smooth muscle cells, activation of MLCK in ECs stimulates the production of important endothelium-derived vascular relaxing factors: MLCK antisense and MLCK inhibitors abolished BK- and TG-induced nitric oxide production, and MLCK inhibitors substantially inhibited acetylcholine-stimulated hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cell membrane in rat mesenteric artery. These results indicate that MLCK controls endothelial CE, but not through MLC phosphorylation, and unveils a hitherto unknown physiological function of the enzyme: vasodilation through its action in endothelial cells. The study discovers a counter-balancing role of MLCK in the regulation of vascular tone."
https://openalex.org/W1993692644,"We have used a telomere-associated chromosome fragmentation strategy to induce internal chromosome-specific breakage of Leishmania chromosomes. The integration of telomeric repeats from the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei into defined positions of the Leishmania genome by homologous recombination can induce chromosome breakage accompanied by the deletion of the chromosomal part that is distal to the site of the break. The cloned telomeric DNA at the end of the truncated chromosomes is functional and it can seed the formation of new telomeric repeats. We found that genome ploidy is often altered upon telomere-mediated chromosome fragmentation events resulting in large chromosomal deletions. In most cases diploidy is either preserved, or partial trisomic cells are observed, but interestingly we report here the generation of partial haploid mutants in this diploid organism. Partial haploid Leishmania mutants should facilitate studies on the function of chromosome-assigned genes.

Leishmania is a kinetoplastid protozoan parasite that is endemic in several parts of the world and is responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity. The structure ofLeishmania chromosomes is comparable to many other protozoa with a central core of single copy or tandemly arrayed genes and a large number of subtelomeric and telomeric repeats at chromosome ends (1Lanzer M.

In eukaryotes, the functional elements known to be essential for segregation and transmission of chromosomes during cell division are origins of replication, centromeres, and telomeres. Although the structure-function and organization of the telomeres are relatively well known in Leishmania (3Fu G. Barker D.C.

We report here a telomere-mediated chromosome fragmentation approach to engineer large chromosomal truncations at defined positions within theLeishmania genome by homologous recombination. Our studies show that cloned telomeric and subtelomeric repeats of the kinetoplastid protozoan T. brucei are capable of inducing a chromosome-specific breakage and the seeding of new telomeres. Using this strategy we have addressed chromosome mitotic stability during cell division in this kinetoplastid parasitic protozoan and have generated large haploid deletions for facilitating functional studies in this diploid organism. L. tarentolaeTarII and Leishmania donovani donovani MHOM/IN/80/DD8 strains have been described previously (39White T.C. Fase-Fowler F. van Luenen H. Calafat J. Borst P. J. Biol.

Approximately ∼4 μg of linearized DNA fragments derived from the different targeting constructs were used to transfect Leishmania cells by electroporation as described (41Papadopoulou B. Roy G.

Transfectants were selected with 40 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) or 160 μg/ml hygromycin B (CalBiochem) on SDM-agar plates (1%). Colonies resistant to G418 and/or to hygromycin B were isolated after 10–15 days of growth at 29 °C. The pTRYNEO-TEL and pPTR1YNEO-TEL fragmentation vectors (see Fig. 1) were made as follows.

Then, the NEO gene cloned downstream of a 92-bp synthetic polypyrimidine stretch necessary for the maturation of NEO transcript was extracted as aSmaI-EcoRV from vector pSPYNEO (42Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and inserted into the EcoRV site of the vector. Vector pYNEO-TEL was further digested with BglII and ligated either to a 1.2-kbBamHI-BglII fragment carrying the L. donovani trypanothione reductase (TR) gene or to a 400-bp BamHI-BglII fragment containing the second half of the L. tarentolae PTR1 gene to yield pTRYNEO-TEL and pPTR1YNEO-TEL, respectively. The fragmentation vector pTRαNEOα-TEL (Fig. 1) was constructed following three cloning steps. First, to change the orientation of the (TG)n repeats, the 1.8-kb fragment containing the telomeric and subtelomeric repeats of T. brucei was extracted by PvuII-EcoRV and re-introduced into the EcoRV site of pSP72. Then theL. donovani TR gene was introduced into the BamHI site of this vector as a BamHI-BglII fragment. Finally, the αNEOα expression cassette isolated from vector pSL1180-αNEOα (43Lamontagne J. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as a EcoRV-SmaI fragment was inserted into the EcoRV site of the above vector. Maturation of the NEO transcript in this cassette is undertaken by the intergenic region of the α-tubulin gene (αIR or α) (44Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To construct the fragmentation vector pPTR1αNEOα-TEL (see Fig. 1), we have replaced the TR gene in pTRαNEOα-TEL by the L. tarentolae PTR1 gene derived from vector pSPY21 in which the PTR1 coding sequence made by polymerase chain reaction was cloned into theEcoRI-BglII sites of pSP72. The PTR1gene in pTRαNEOα-TEL was cloned as aSmaI-SmaI fragment into theXbaI-ApaI sites of the vector filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase I. To construct vector pYHYG-SceI, the 18-bp recognition sequence of the yeast endonuclease I-SceI was first introduced into the KpnI site of pSP72 and then the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HYG) derived from pSPYHYG (42Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was cloned as a BamHI-BglII fragment into the BamHI site of this vector. The I-SceI recognition site was made as described by Tamar et al. (45Tamar S. Dumas C. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Expression of the HYG gene in vector pYHYG-SceI is driven by a synthetic polypyrimidine stretch of 92 bp including an AG-spliced acceptor site (42Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To make vector pPTR1YHYG-SceI, the BamHI-BglII HYG-SceI expression cassette was introduced into the uniqueBamHI site of the L. tarentolae PTR1 gene, part of vector p40.8 (41Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To target sequence X located at 3.9 kb upstream of the L. donovani TR gene, theBamHI-BglII HYG-SceI cassette treated with Klenow DNA polymerase I was introduced into the ClaI site (filled in with Klenow) of a 7-kb XhoI fragment, part of cosmid E7-2 (36Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), previously cloned into the XhoI site of vector pSP72. To construct vector pB562YHYG-SceI, a 6.8-kbBamHI-BamHI fragment derived from cosmid B5-62 mapped on L. donovani infantum chromosome 5 (45Tamar S. Dumas C. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) was first cloned into the BamHI site of pGEM7Zf (Promega). TheBamHI-BglII HYG-SceI expression cassette was then introduced into the unique BglII site of this 6.8-kb fragment. kilobase(s) base pair(s) Total genomic DNA of Leishmania was prepared as described (47Bernards A.

Intact Leishmania chromosomes were prepared from cells harvested during mid- to late log-phase, washed, and lysed in situ in 1% low melting agarose plugs as previously described (46Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4305-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). I-SceI digestion was performed as described (45Tamar S. Dumas C. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Intact and I-SceI-digestedLeishmania chromosomes were migrated through 1% ultrapure agarose (Bio-Rad) gels in 1 × TBE using a Bio-Rad CHEF-DR III apparatus at 5.9 V/cm, 120° separation angle and switch times varying from 35 to 120 s for 25–30 h. Southern blot, hybridization, and washings were done following standard procedures (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). The PTR1-, TR-, NEO-, and HYG-specific probes used in these studies were made by polymerase chain reaction. A PGPA-specific probe was made as described (49Legare D. Hettema E. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A probe containing more than 50 tandem telomeric repeats of the hexamer 5′-CCCTAA-3′ and a ∼1.5 kb of subtelomeric sequences ofT. brucei (TEL) isolated from plasmid pT4 (7Van der Ploeg L.H. Liu A.Y. Borst P. Cell. 1984; 36: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was used in this study. A ∼500-bp polymerase chain reaction fragment corresponding to the subtelomeric repeat of T. brucei was used as a probe to distinguish between endogenous and cloned telomeric DNA. Probe B562 corresponds to a 6.8-kbBamHI-BamHI fragment derived from cosmid B562 mapped on L. donovani infantum chromosome 5 (45Tamar S. Dumas C. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Probe X corresponds to a 3.9-kb XhoI-ClaI fragment located upstream of the L. donovani TR gene. Probe Y corresponds to a 1.7-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment located at ∼10 kb downstream of the L. tarentolae PTR1gene and it is part of vector pMAC40 (39White T.C. Fase-Fowler F. van Luenen H. Calafat J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16977-16983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate genome ploidy in the different transfectants subjected to chromosome fragmentation events (see Figs. 8 and 9), we have quantified hybridization intensities of different chromosome-specific genes by densitometric analysis of the Southern blots and filters using a PhosphorImager with the ImageQuant 3.1 software. Internal standards corresponding to single copy Leishmania genes were used for this analysis.Figure 9Alterations in the genome ploidy of L. tarentolae transfectants carrying large chromosomal deletions mediated by experimentally induced chromosome fragmentation events.

The RevD transfectant became diploid for chromosome 23.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability to engineer large chromosomal alterations by gene targeting mediated by homologous recombination in Leishmania cells would be useful for analyzing chromosome function. To generate a defined chromosomal breakage at internal genomic sites, we have therefore constructed a series of chromosome fragmentation vectors that could direct a cloned telomeric DNA to a specific position within the Leishmaniagenome. All these fragmentation constructs are acentric (centromeres have not been characterized yet in protozoan parasites) and contain cloned telomeric DNA from T. brucei (7Van der Ploeg L.H. Liu A.Y. Borst P. Cell. 1984; 36: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) marker for selection and a region of homology to allow targeted integration into the parasite genome by homologous recombination. The direction of chromosome breakage is dependent on the orientation of telomeric repeats in the fragmentation vectors, which are cloned in a 5′ to 3′ TTAGGG orientation to serve as a template for the telomerase. The cloned telomeric DNA is part of a 1.8-kb fragment derived from the kinetoplastid protozoan parasiteT. brucei that contains 300 bp of the telomeric hexamer repeat (TTAGGG)n and 1.5 kb of subtelomeric sequences (7Van der Ploeg L.H. Liu A.Y. Borst P. Cell. 1984; 36: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The maturation of the NEOtranscript in these vectors is driven either by a synthetic stretch of 90 pyrimidines with an AG-spliced acceptor site (Y) (42Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or from the intergenic region of the α-tubulin gene (α) (44Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In all cases, the NEO gene is oriented toward the cloned telomeric DNA to be better expressed as already reported for T. brucei artificial minichromosomes (14Lee M.G. Yaping E. Axelrod N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4893-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Patnaik P.K. Axelrod N. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Cross G.A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have chosen to target two distinct loci, the trypanothione reductase (TR) gene of L. donovani (36Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 50Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) mapped on chromosome 5 and theL. tarentolae pteridine reductase 1 gene (PTR1), part of the H locus (41Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 51Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24165-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mapped on chromosome 23. The fragmentation vectors were designed in such a way to delete sequences from both parts of the chromosome breakage site depending on the 5′-3′ orientation of the guanine-rich strand with respect to each chromosomal end (see Fig.1). We first introduced the cloned telomeric DNA into the L. donovani TR gene on chromosome 5 by transfecting pTRYNEO-TEL and pTRαNEOα-TEL linear fragmentation vectors (see Fig. 1) to delete either one or the other arm of chromosome 5 flanking the TRtarget locus. The chromosomal position of the TR gene has been estimated at 120 and 400 kb from the telomeres using an in vitro chromosome fragmentation approach mediated by the endonuclease I-SceI (45Tamar S. Dumas C. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The outcome of a fragmentation event depends upon the orientation of the stretch of targeting DNA along the Leishmania chromosome. If the TR gene is oriented toward the long 400-kb arm of the chromosome, the fragmentation event using the pTRYNEO-TEL linearized construct (Fig. 1) should produce a 400-kb truncated chromosome hybridizing to the NEO probe (Fig. 2 A). If present in the opposite orientation, the same construct should generate a truncated chromosomal fragment of 120 kb (Fig. 2 A). Hybridization of Leishmania chromosomes resolved by CHEF electrophoresis with a TR probe indicated a specific breakage at the level of the TR locus and the generation of a 400-kb truncated chromosome in the transfectants (Fig. 2 A). This engineered minichromosome hybridized to the NEO probe (Fig.2 A) strongly suggesting that the TR gene is oriented toward the right telomere of chromosome 5. Only one allele has been targeted upon G418 selection hence explaining the hybridization of the intact 520-kb chromosomal allele with the TR probe in the transfectant, as the Leishmania genome is diploid (Fig.2 A). Once we determined the orientation of the TR gene on chromosome 5, we made a fragmentation vector to generate a 120-kb truncated chromosome. Upon the homologous integration of pTRαNEOα-TEL vector into the TR locus, a specific chromosome breakage has occurred, which resulted in a truncated 120-kb chromosomal fragment hybridizing to the TR and NEO probes (Fig.2 B). Similar experiments were carried out with the second target locus, the PTR1 gene, on chromosome 23 of L. tarentolae. The chromosomal position of PTR1 gene was estimated by the endonuclease I-SceI-mediated chromosome fragmentation approach to be at 140 and 650 kb from the telomeres (45Tamar S. Dumas C. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Homologous integration of the pPTR1αNEOα-TEL (Fig. 1) linearized vector into the PTR1 locus resulted in chromosome fragmentation as shown in the filter hybridization of Fig.3 A. The generation of a 650-kb truncated chromosomal fragment hybridizing to PTR1 and NEO probes suggests that the PTR1 gene is oriented toward the long 650-kb arm of chromosome 23 (Fig. 3 A). As expected, the integration of the pPTR1YNEO-TEL vector generated a 140-kb fragment hybridizing to the NEO probe (Fig. 3 B). Hence, our results indicate that the integration of cloned telomeric DNA from T. brucei into defined internal chromosomal locations within theLeishmania genome has produced specific chromosome breakage and the generation of truncated minichromosomes carrying telomeric repeats at both sides (Figs. 2 and 3). All the fragmentation vectors used for the above studies carry a single region of homology from 0.4 to 1.2 kb and once linearized they generate one double-strand break that could be used for targeting by homologous recombination. Targeting most likely occurred through homologous recombination by a single crossover event at the level of the targeted genomic sequence (Figs. 2and 3). The T. brucei telomeric DNA did not integrate into pre-existing internal telomeric repeats that could possibly surround the TR and PTR1 loci, as suggested from sequence data (data not shown). Our results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 show that linear fragmentation vectors carrying cloned telomeres at one end, once integrated by homologous recombination into the targeted loci, can induce defined chromosomal truncations and generate chromosomal fragments with added telomeres at the break site. To determine whether the cloned T. brucei telomeric DNA can seed the formation of a new telomere, the length and heterogeneity of the terminal restriction genomic fragments in the different classes of transfectants (Figs. 2 and 3) were examined. Restriction fragments of known size that harbor either the T. brucei cloned 1.8-kb telomeric and subtelomeric repeats (Fig. 4,A and B) or the telomeric DNA together with theNEO marker and/or the targeted gene (Figs. 4,A-C, and 5) were compared by Southern blot hybridization. In all cases, the length of the telomeric repeats at the end of the truncated chromosomal fragments was higher than the one in the original fragmentation vectors extended from few hundred to more than 3,600 nucleotides depending on the transfectant and on the fragmentation event (Figs. 4 and 5). Indeed, XbaI genomic fragments of 12 kb (Fig. 4 A) and 9.5 kb (Fig.4 B), and a PstI 3-kb fragment (Fig.4 C) have hybridized to a NEO probe instead of the expected 10.5-, 8.0-, and 2.5-kb fragments, respectively (lower panel, Fig. 4, A-C)"

It promotes genetic diversity, plays an important role in DNA repair and helps maintain genome integrity. Escherichia coli RecA protein plays a central role in homologous recombination pathways and catalyzes strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules, leading to the formation of recombination intermediates (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these intermediates, two homologous duplex DNA molecules are joined by a four-way DNA junction referred to as a Holliday junction (3Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). E. coli proteins RuvA and RuvB form a protein complex that promotes branch migration of Holliday junction and facilitates the extension of heteroduplex DNA region. E. coli RuvC protein resolves a Holliday junction by endonucleolytic cleavage (4Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5West S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that the three proteins RuvABC form a protein complex called a resolvasome that efficiently processes Holliday junctions (6van Gool A.J. Hajibagheri N.M. Stasiak A. West S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1861-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although Holliday junction-resolving activities have been found in extracts from a wide variety of organisms, E. coli RuvC is one of the best characterized resolvases. Genetic analyses indicate that RuvC resolvase plays a defined role in processing recombination and repair intermediates (7Otsuji N. Iyehara H. Hideshima Y. J.

In vitro studies confirm that RuvC specifically interacts with and resolves Holliday junctions by endonucleolytic cleavage (12Dunderdale H.J. Benson F.E. Parsons C.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Using several model substrates, including synthetic Holliday junctions, the following has been shown. (i) RuvC is active as a stable dimer that binds a Holliday junction in the presence or absence of divalent metal ions (13Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Shiba T. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15132-15139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) RuvC forms a complex with Holliday junctions in which the two continuous (noncrossover) DNA strands at the junction are hypersensitive to attack by hydroxyl radicals and permanganate; this indicates a distortion in the junction DNA and disruption of base pairing at the crossover. This is likely to be an important characteristic of the interaction between RuvC and its DNA substrate (14Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C.

(iii) In the presence of metal ions such as Mg2+ and Mn2+, RuvC resolves the junctions by introducing symmetrical nicks in the continuous (noncrossover) strands (14Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J.

A previously isolated F69L mutant of RuvC showed no detectable cleavage activity, but formed a dimer that bound a Holliday junction in the same manner as wild-type RuvC, as judged by a gel shift assay in which no salt was added to the reaction mixtures (23Ichiyanagi K. Iwasaki H. Hishida T. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This result suggests that Phe-69 does not directly participate in DNA binding activity detectable by a salt-free gel shift assay, but that it must play an important role in RuvC function. We speculated that this residue makes a stacking interaction with a nucleotide base near the cleavage site (20Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 23Ichiyanagi K. Iwasaki H. Hishida T. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This study examines the role of Phe-69 of RuvC in greater detail. A series of mutants of Phe-69 were constructed and analyzed in vivo and in vitro. The results provide direct evidence that Phe-69 interacts with DNA and contributes to disruption of base paring in the RuvC·DNA complex. This function is critically important for formation of a catalytically competent complex between RuvC and the Holliday junction. A model is proposed for RuvC-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage and resolution of Holliday junctions. E. coli strain HRS1200 (ΔruvC200::Kmr) is a derivative of AB1157, a ruv + control strain (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). HRS777 is a ΔruvC200::Kmrderivative of BL21 (DE3) and was used for overproduction of mutant RuvC proteins (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRC100 (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) carries theruvC + gene in pET-8c, a T7 expression plasmid (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). The mutant ruvC genes were constructed based on the method of Kunkel (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto). The codon for Phe-69 (TTT) was altered to that of Tyr (TAC), Trp (TGG), and Ala (GCT). ruvC gene mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The F69L mutant had been isolated in a previous study (23Ichiyanagi K. Iwasaki H. Hishida T. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Each mutant ruvC gene was carried in pET-8c with the same construction as pRC100. Bacteria were routinely cultured in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. If necessary, ampicillin was added to the medium at the final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Exponentially growing HRS1200 (ΔruvC) cells harboring ruvC-expression plasmids, which were suspended in M9 buffer (∼2 × 108 cells per ml), were irradiated with various doses of UV. Cells were plated on Luria-Bertani plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml), and the surviving colonies were scored after incubation for 15 h at 37 °C in the dark. Phe-69 mutant proteins were purified by the same procedure as wild-type and other mutant proteins, which was described in our previous report (22Yoshikawa M. Iwasaki H. Kinoshita K. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Synthetic Holliday junctions were prepared by annealing four synthetic oligonucleotides as described (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The sequences of synthetic Holliday junctions, X12 and HJ2, were described elsewhere (22Yoshikawa M. Iwasaki H. Kinoshita K. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The synthetic Holliday junction HJ2L consists of four oligonucleotides, which are ST-1 (5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCTGGCTTTGACCTCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′), ST-2 (5′-TGGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGAGGTCAATCGGTTGTAAACGTCAAGCTTTATGCCGTT-3′), ST-3 (5′-GAACGGCATAAAGCTTGACGATTACAACCGATTCTGGAGCTGTCTAGAGGATCCGACTATCGA-3′), and ST-4 (5′-ATCGATAGTCGGATCCTCTAGACAGCTCCAGAAAGCCAGGCACTGGTAGAATTCGGCAGCGT-3′). The sequences underlined are the same junction core sequences as those of HJ2. HJ2L was used as a substrate for a potassium permanganate footprinting experiment. Holliday junction cleavage and gel shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 10 ng of a32P-labeled synthetic Holliday junction, 20 mmTris acetate, pH 8.0, 10 mm (for cleavage assay) or 0.5 mm (for gel shift assay) magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and the indicated concentrations of RuvC. For a standard cleavage assay, the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the samples were analyzed by 9% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)1 in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) buffer. To determinate the cleavage sites, samples which had been incubated at 37 °C for 60 min were analyzed by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. For a standard gel shift assay, the reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 min, and the samples were analyzed by in 6% PAGE in TAM (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate) buffer. The radioactive materials were analyzed quantitatively using an image analyzer, Fuji BAS1000. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 3 ng of 5′ 32P-labeled junction DNA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and the indicated concentrations of RuvC were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Two microliters of 50 mmKMnO4 was added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for another 2 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 2 μl of 14.7m β-mercaptoethanol. The products were extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol and dried. Pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of 1 m piperidine, and the samples were heated at 90 °C for 30 min. The products were separated by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and analyzed using Fuji BAS1000. RuvC mutants F69Y, F69W, and F69A were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of a plasmid based on pET-8c (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins and RuvC F69L (23Ichiyanagi K. Iwasaki H. Hishida T. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were tested for in vivo complementation of the UV repair deficiency of ΔruvC strain HRS1200. RuvC F69W, F69A, and F69L did not complement the UV sensitivity of HRS1200 (Fig.1). However, F69Y was active in repair and near fully complemented the repair defect. The expression level of these four mutants and wild-type RuvC was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-RuvC serum (data not shown). All four mutants were expressed at the same level as wild-type RuvC in HRS1200 cells under the conditions of the UV sensitivity test. Thus, it is likely that RuvC F69W, F69A, and F69L do not complement the repair deficiency because they are deficient in repair and not because they are poorly expressed or unstable proteins. Because RuvC F69Y complements the ΔruvC deficiency but RuvC F69W, F69A, and F69L do not, it is likely that a benzene ring is required at this position of RuvC for proper enzymatic function. Phe-69 mutant proteins were purified to greater than 99% homogeneity and characterized in vitro. These proteins were free of nonspecific nuclease activity (data not shown). RuvC D7N was also used as a negative control in these studies. This mutant has an amino acid change in the enzyme active site and binds to junction DNA with the same affinity as wild-type RuvC but is unable to cleave DNA (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cleavage activity of these mutants was examined using a synthetic Holliday junction, HJ2, as a substrate (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that RuvC F69Y is partially active as an endonuclease (63% of wild-type RuvC activity), but RuvC F69W, F69A, F69L, and D7N do not generate any detectable cleavage products with the synthetic Holliday junction substrate. During a longer incubation, F69W cleaved the substrate with low efficiency (∼4% cleavage product), but F69A, F69L, and D7N produced no cleavage product after 2 h (data not shown). Essentially the same results were obtained with another synthetic Holliday junction DNA substrate, X12, which was used previously by van Gool et al. (25van Gool A.J. Shah R. Mézard C. West S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1838-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that the results are not restricted to a particular substrate. RuvC F69Y cleaved HJ2 and X12 at the same sites as wild-type RuvC (data not shown). These results confirm the in vivoresults and suggest that Phe-69 can be substituted with tyrosine but not with other amino acids that lack a benzene ring. The binding affinity of the RuvC Phe-69 mutants for a synthetic Holliday junction was examined using a gel-shift assay in the absence (Fig.3 A) and presence of 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 B). All RuvC mutants formed a complex with HJ2 DNA as efficiently as wild-type protein in the absence of NaCl. This result is consistent with the previous result (23Ichiyanagi K. Iwasaki H. Hishida T. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, F69A and F69L did not bind junction DNA in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 B, lanes 11–16). This result indicates that substitution of Phe-69 by alanine or leucine reduces binding affinity when electrostatic interaction between RuvC and DNA is altered by a high concentration of monovalent salt. The fact that RuvC F69Y retains substantial cleavage activity (Fig. 2) and full binding activity (Fig. 3) suggests that the aromatic ring of the side chain of the residue 69 position is involved in a nonelectrostatic interaction with the Holliday junction DNA substrate and that this interaction is essential for cleavage by RuvC endonuclease. Interestingly, RuvC F69W has very low endonuclease activity but binds to the synthetic Holliday junction as efficiently as or more efficiently than wild-type RuvC even in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 B,lanes 8–10). This may indicate that the tryptophan residue interferes with cleavage of the Holliday junction because it is bulkier than phenylalanine or tyrosine; nevertheless RuvC F69W binds DNA similarly to wild-type and F69Y RuvC. The conformation of the synthetic Holliday junction substrate was previously characterized in the presence of Mg2+ (26Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Churchill M.E. Tullius T.D. Kallenbach N.R. Seeman N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4653-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The protein-free DNA junction folds into a stacked X-structure, which exhibits 2-fold symmetry. In this structure, two strands approximate B-form DNA, and the complementary strands are sharply bent as they pass from one helix to the other. Base pairing is maintained all around the junction (26Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,27Churchill M.E. Tullius T.D. Kallenbach N.R. Seeman N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4653-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When RuvC binds to the DNA substrate, the crossover is converted from a folded form into an unfolded form with 2-fold symmetry, and base pairing around the crossover is disrupted (14Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that disruption of base pairing is a crucial step in forming a catalytically competent complex between RuvC and the Holliday junction substrate (14Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These observations raise a possibility that Phe-69 is involved in a stacking interaction with a nucleotide base close to the crossover; formation of the catalytically competent complex may involve this interaction and the disruption of the base pairing associated with it. This hypothesis was tested by carrying out potassium permanganate (KMnO4) analysis of junction DNA complexes in the presence of wild-type or mutant RuvC (Fig.4). Potassium permanganate attacks the C-5=C-6 double bond in thymines that are unstacked, unwound, or unpaired (28Buckle M. Fritsch A. Roux P. Geiselmann J. Buc H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 236-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, this method is useful for detecting base disruption around a Holliday junction crossover. A synthetic junction called HJ2L was used in the KMnO4footprinting studies. HJ2L has longer arms but has the same central 10-base pair sequence as HJ2. HJ2L was used in this experiment, because it gives a piperidine-cleaved ladder with more similar intervals around the crossover than HJ2; its use would make it easier to evaluate the sensitivity of each band of the ladder. Wild-type RuvC cleaves the same sequences of HJ2 and HJ2L with equal efficiency (data not shown). Each of the four strands of HJ2L was probed with KMnO4 in the presence of Mg2+. In the absence of protein, only background reactivity was observed. In the presence of wild-type RuvC, all thymine bases within the homologous region and two thymine bases outside the homologous region were hypersensitive to KMnO4. The following thymines were highly reactive: three bases in the homologous region on strand 1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes b–d); the thymine next to the homologous region on strand 2 (Fig.4 B, lanes b–d), and two thymines in the homologous region on strand 3 (data not shown). Strand 4 has no thymine bases near the crossover, and no hypersensitive bases were detected on this strand. A cleavage product was also detected on strand 1 produced by nicking at 5′-TTT↓G-3′. A DNA·RuvC complex with the active site mutant RuvC D7N produced the same KMnO4 hypersensitivity as the complex with wild-type RuvC, but no cleavage product was observed (lanes m and n). The results of these control experiments were highly consistent with the results of earlier studies that used a different DNA substrate (16Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Hagan N.F.P. Vincent S.D. Ingleston S.M. Sharoles G.J. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). KMnO4sensitivity was also examined in complexes between RuvC Phe-69 mutants and HJ2L. Complexes with F69Y and F69W (lanes e–h) had the same KMnO4 sensitivity as complexes with wild-type and D7N mutants of RuvC. In contrast, complexes with RuvC F69A and F69L demonstrated severely decreased sensitivity at the first thymine base on strand 1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes i–l) and the thymine base on strand 2 (Fig. 4 B, lanes i–l) although very similar sensitivity was observed for the two thymine bases on strand 3 (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the aromatic side chain of Phe-69 interacts with particular nucleotide(s) and is involved in inducing an opened state of the crossover upon disruption of the base pairing. Fig. 5 summarizes the results of footprinting analysis of RuvC complexes with junction DNA. This study presents genetic and biochemical evidence that the benzene ring of residue Phe-69 in RuvC is catalytically important for Holliday junction resolution. RuvC F69Y has substantial DNA repair activity in vivo, and it cleaves synthetic Holliday junctions with reasonable efficiency in vitro. In contrast, F69W, F69A, and F69L do not repair DNA damage in vivo or cleave synthetic Holliday junctions in vitro. RuvC F69A and F69L show reduced binding to junctions under high salt conditions, indicating that Phe-69 is involved in the interaction between RuvC and its DNA substrate. Indeed, the benzene ring of Phe-69 faces the catalytic center (20Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which is a relatively uncommon orientation for hydrophobic residues such as phenylalanine. RuvC F69W binds DNA junctions with similar affinity to RuvC wild-type and F69Y, but F69W can not resolve Holliday junctions in vivo or in vitro. This suggests that precise interaction of the benzene ring at position 69 with the junction, that cannot be mediated by a bulky tryptophan residue, is required for junction resolution. Notably, orthologs of RuvC from eubacteria have phenylalanine or tyrosine but not tryptophan at the position equivalent to Phe-69 in E. coli RuvC (22Yoshikawa M. Iwasaki H. Kinoshita K. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that RuvC binding leads to disruption of base pairing at the crossover junction. It is likely that this DNA conformational change is important in the mechanism of cleavage and resolution by RuvC (14Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A prominent wall is located between the two active centers in the RuvC dimer, and docking studies using RuvC dimer and junction DNA indicate that this wall disrupts base pairing of the junction DNA by penetrating the junction center (20Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The wall consists of the protruding loop preceding the second α-helix, and the aromatic ring of Phe-69 faces the active center. A structure-based model was proposed based on docking experiments which suggests that the aromatic ring of Phe-69 makes a stacking interaction with a nucleotide base close to the junction point (20Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Footprinting analysis with permanganate showed that the DNA substrate HJ2L contains thymines that become hypersensitive when wild-type RuvC binds. The hypersensitive bases include 3 thymines in strand 1, a single thymine in strand 2, and 2 thymines in strand 3 (Fig. 4). However, RuvC F69A and F69L did not fully induce hypersensitivity at the first thymine in strand 1 or the thymine in strand 2, whereas the hypersensitivity of the other thymines was not reduced in complexes with these RuvC mutants (Figs. 4 and 5). These observations suggest that Phe-69 is involved in disruption of a particular base pair near the junction crossover. We propose that the overall disruption of base pairing is induced when the wall penetrates the junction center (20Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and that the aromatic ring of Phe-69 stabilizes an open structure by a stacking interaction with a nucleotide base, which is one of the requirements for catalytic competence. A catalytically important phenylalanine residue has been reported in the mismatch repair protein MutS, in which a specific phenylalanine forms a stacking interaction with a mismatched base (30Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 31Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis of the protein-free junction (data not shown) and identification of the strands cleaved by RuvC (Fig. 4) revealed structural information on the configuration of the HJ2L model junction (Fig. 5). Strands 1 and 3 are continuous (noncrossover) strands, and strands 2 and 4 are crossover strands. HJ2L contains a 4-base pair homologous core in the central region of the junction (a bimobile junction), which means that it can make two steps of spontaneous branch migration; thus, HJ2L has three possible junction points. Recently, we showed that RuvC preferentially nicks the phosphodiester bond one nucleotide 3′ to the crossover point (32Sha R. Iwasaki H. Liu F. Shinagawa H. Seeman N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11982-11988Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cleavage site is 5′-TTT↓G-3′ in strand 1 (arrow indicates the cleavage site) and the crossover point is 5′-TT‖TG-3′ (vertical bar indicates crossover). These results are shown schematically in Fig. 5. The permanganate footprinting analysis using RuvC mutants F69A and F69L suggest that Phe-69 affects the base pairings 2.5 nucleotides 5′ to the cleavage site (Figs. 4 and 5). It is not possible to determine whether Phe-69 interacts with the continuous or the crossover strand of the substrate from the footprinting experiment. However, the model for the RuvC-junction complex based on docking experiments suggests that the base on the continuous strand is closer to Phe-69 in each RuvC monomer than the base in the crossover strand (20Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, the data indicate that each Phe-69 residue in the RuvC dimer forms a stacking interaction with a base 2.5 nucleotides 5′ to the cleavage site on the continuous strand. This stacking interaction stabilizes an open state in the junction core and leads to formation of a catalytically competent protein-DNA complex. Based on this information, a proposed catalytic mechanism for RuvC-mediated cleavage is presented in Fig.6. When RuvC binds the junction DNA, it induces a change in the DNA configuration from a stacked X structure to an unfolded core structure (14Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The four acidic residues Asp-7, Glu-66, Asp-138, and Asp-141 constitute the catalytic center of RuvC (21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These residues coordinate divalent metal cation(s) such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ and make a pentacoordinated intermediate using the metal ion(s) and phosphodiester bonds at the cleavage site on the continuous strand (17Bennett R.J. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two basic residues, Lys-107 and Lys-118, interact with the negatively charged phosphate of the DNA backbone via electrostatic interactions and stabilize the pentacoordinated intermediate in which negative charge accumulates during the transition state of hydrolysis (22Yoshikawa M. Iwasaki H. Kinoshita K. Shinagawa H. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Phe-69 residue forms a stacking interaction with a base 2.5 nucleotides 5′ to the cleavage site to stabilize the open state in the junction core, as described above. This model is well consistent with the results ofin vivo and in vitro analyses of many mutant RuvC proteins and with feature of the RuvC structure. Further physicochemical analyses such as x-ray crystallography of RuvC-Holliday junction complexes will provide more direct evidence concerning the mechanism of RuvC-mediated resolution of Holliday junctions. We thank K. Morikawa for valuable discussions and continuous encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W1606639445,"In vertebrates, dietary fat digestion mainly results from the combined effect of pancreatic lipase, colipase, and bile. It has been proposed that in vivo lipase adsorption on oil-water emulsion is mediated by a preformed lipase-colipase-mixed micelle complex. The main lipase-colipase binding site is located on the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. We report here that in vitro the isolated C-terminal domain behaves as a potent noncovalent inhibitor of lipase and that the inhibitory effect is triggered by the presence of micelles. Lipase inhibition results from the formation of a nonproductive C-terminal domain-colipase-micelle ternary complex, which competes for colipase with the active lipase-colipase-micelle ternary complex, thus diverting colipase from its lipase-anchoring function. The formation of such a complex has been evidenced by molecular sieving experiments. This nonproductive complex lowers the amount of active lipase thus reducing lipolysis. Preliminary experiments performed in rats show that the C-terminal domain also behaves as an inhibitor in vivo and thus could be considered a potential new tool for specifically reducing intestinal lipolysis.

Lipase inhibition results from the formation of a nonproductive C-terminal domain-colipase-micelle ternary complex, which competes for colipase with the active lipase-colipase-micelle ternary complex, thus diverting colipase from its lipase-anchoring function. The formation of such a complex has been evidenced by molecular sieving experiments. This nonproductive complex lowers the amount of active lipase thus reducing lipolysis. Preliminary experiments performed in rats show that the C-terminal domain also behaves as an inhibitor in vivo and thus could be considered a potential new tool for specifically reducing intestinal lipolysis. In vertebrates, the digestion of dietary triacylglycerols, although initiated in the upper part of the digestive tract by preduodenal lipases, is driven to completion in the intestine by the combined effects of pancreatic lipase (EC 3.1.1.3), colipase, and bile secretion. Intestinal lipolysis proceeds through an heterogeneous catalysis involving a lipase activation step that requires the presence of pancreatic colipase to circumvent the inhibitory effect of natural amphiphilic compounds. In the intestine, these compounds are coating the oil/water interface thus impeding lipase adsorption on its substrate. The primary function of colipase is, therefore, to anchor lipase on its substrate in the presence of amphiphiles. Pancreatic lipase is made up of a single polypeptide chain folded in two domains (1Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature.. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar, 2Bourne Y. Martinez C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol... 1994; 238: 709-732Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (residues 1–336) bears the catalytic triad, which is buried underneath a surface loop (the flap) controlling the access of substrate. The C-terminal domain (residues 337–449) is mainly devoted to colipase binding (3Mahé-Gouhier N. Léger C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1988; 229: 286-289Google Scholar, 4van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L.

The understanding of the activation process has progressed dramatically thanks to the resolution of several three-dimensional structures of both lipase and lipase-colipase complexes (1Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature.. 1990; 343: 771-774Google Scholar, 2Bourne Y. Martinez C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol... 1994; 238: 709-732Google Scholar, 5Hermoso J.

Nature.. 1993; 362: 814-820Google Scholar). The motion of the flap from a closed (inactive conformation) to an open (active conformation) position unmasks the active site that consequently adopts the catalytically active configuration. Recently, Hermoso et al. (7Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 5531-5536Google Scholar) proposed that in vivo lipase activation results from the formation in solution of a ternary complex involving lipase, colipase, and a mixed bile lipid micelle. The complex represents the functional unit able to bind the emulsified oil droplets and to perform catalysis. The micelle is located in a cavity delineated by the C-terminal domain and colipase. Although mainly interacting with the concave face of colipase, the disc-shaped micelle is also in close contact with several segments of the lipase C-terminal domain. Thus, the strengthening of the interactions between lipase and colipase observed in the presence of micelles (7Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 5531-5536Google Scholar, 8Larsson A. Erlansson-Albertsson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1986; 664: 538-548Google Scholar) mainly occursvia the C-terminal domain of lipase. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to regulate specifically the pancreatic lipase activity based on the ability of the isolated C-terminal domain of lipase to behave as a functional entity toward colipase binding (9Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Granon S. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Protein Eng... 1996; 9: 707-711Google Scholar). We demonstrated that in vitrothis domain behaves as a specific inhibitor of pancreatic lipase under conditions approximating the physiological ones. We also report preliminary results indicating that the C-terminal domain is able to significantly reduce lipolysis in vivo in rats. Taurodeoxycholic acid (NaTDC),1 glycocholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, oleic acid,l-α-phosphatidylcholine and tributyrin were purchased from Sigma. Porcine pancreatic lipase and colipase were purified from a pancreatic powder as previously described in Refs. 10Lombardo D. Chapus C. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol... 1989; 205: 259-261Google Scholarand 11Chapus C. Desnuelle P. Foglizzo E. Eur. J. Biochem... 1981; 115: 99-105Google Scholar, respectively. The C-terminal domain was obtained by limited proteolysis of porcine lipase as reported in Ref. 9Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Granon S. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Protein Eng... 1996; 9: 707-711Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined at 280 nm using a molecular extinction coefficient (ε) of 6.65 × 104m−1 cm−1, 0.4 × 104m−1 cm−1 and 1.2 × 104m−1cm−1 for lipase, colipase, and C-terminal domain, respectively. N-terminal sequence analyses were performed by stepwise Edman degradation using a gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 470A). The resulting phenylthiohydantoin-derivative amino acids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 column (Brownlee, 5 μm, 220 × 2.1 mm inner diameter). They were eluted using a gradient from 10 to 46% methanol in 7 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.84. MALDI-MS was performed on a reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with delayed extraction (Voyager DE-RP, Perceptive Biosystems Inc.). The sample was first dissolved in 10 μl of acetic acid and then diluted with 90 μl of water. From this sample, 0.7 μl (about 4 picomoles) was directly mixed on the support with an equal volume of sinapinic matrix (saturated solution of sinapinic acid solution in 40% acetonitrile, 60% water, made 0.1% in trifluoroacetic acid). Analysis was conducted in linear mode using apomyoglobin as calibrant. Molecular sieving experiments were performed on an Ultrogel Aca54 column (90 × 1 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing 0.1 mNaCl and 1 mm benzamidine in the presence or in the absence of 4 mm NaTDC. Blue dextran at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was used to determine the void volume of the column. The flow rate was 6 ml/h. The volume of the fractions was 0.8 ml. The fractions were analyzed by either 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). To normalize data, the Kav values were calculated according to the equation, Kav = (Ve −Vo)/(Vt −Vo) where Ve,Vo, and Vt correspond to the elution volume, the void volume, and the total volume of the column, respectively. Lipase activity was potentiometrically determined at 25 °C using either 0.11m emulsified tributyrin, pH 7.5 or 10 mmtriolein, pH 8.5 in the presence of colipase. The lipase and colipase concentrations were in the range of 10−9m and the lipase/colipase ratio varied from 0.9 to 1.2. One unit corresponds to the release of 1.0 μmol of fatty acid/min. The lipase activity was measured either in the absence or in the presence of increasing amounts of a stock solution of porcine lipase C-terminal domain (10−4m). Pure or mixed bile salts were added to the assay from either a 15 mm stock solution of NaTDC or a 180 mm stock solution of a physiological mixture of bile salts (total bile salts) containing 54, 46, 22, 20, 23, and 12 mm of glycocholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, and taurodeoxycholic acid, respectively (13Bouchier I.A.D. Freston J.W. Lancet.. 1968; 1: 340-344Google Scholar). Adult male Wistar rats (Iffo-Credo, l'Arbresle, France) weighing 250–300 g were housed in wire-bottomed cages in an air-conditioned room with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Water and food were supplied ad libidum for a week. Then, the rats were starved for 24 h before the experiment with only water ad libidum. Thereby, rat stomachs were free of any material. In a first step of experiments, two groups of rats (n = 10, each) were orally given 1.5 ml of a liquid test meal consisting of a lipid emulsion containing triolein, cholesterol, lecithin (90% pure, from Lipoid (FRG), albumin, sucrose, and NaCl prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (Sigma, TableI). [carboxyl-14C]Triolein (4.13 GBq/mmol, 98% pure) was used to quantify the extent of lipolysis by measuring the total radioactivity associated with mono, di, and triolein.Table IComposition of the liquid test mealssucrose800 mgbovine serum albumin200 mgtriolein500 mg[carboxyl-14C]triolein37 kBqcholesterol20 mgsoybean lecithin12.5 mgPBS buffer, pH 7.21.5 mlThe mixture was emulsified with a sonicator (Branson). Open table in a new tab The mixture was emulsified with a sonicator (Branson). For the test group of rats, 1 mg of porcine C-terminal domain in 0.5 ml of water was added to the meal. For the control group, 0.5 ml of water was added to the meal. After 3.5 h of digestion, the rats were anesthetized with diethyl ether and then killed by total exsanguination. The small intestine was rapidly removed, and its content was collected on ice by flushing with 10 ml of ice-cold 2 mm sodium taurocholate. After acidification with HCl to inactivate pancreatic lipase and homogenization with a Potter homogenizer, 1-ml aliquots were taken for radioactivity determination. The mucosa of each intestinal segment was scraped on ice and acidified with HCl. Total lipids were extracted overnight two times with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). Aliquots of mucosal extracts (4 ml) were evaporated to dryness and counted for radioactivity. The cecum was clamped and opened by incision, and its content was collected after rinsing with 2-ml ice-cold normal saline. Lipids were extracted as mentioned above, and their radioactivity was determined by the liquid scintillation method. To evaluate the gastric emptying, the stomach of the rats was clamped at the cardia and pylorus sphincter and removed. Its content was collected on ice after rinsing with 2 ml of ice-cold normal saline and homogenized with a Potter. Aliquots (500 μl) were used for scintillation counting. In a second set of experiments, the test meal was directly infused in the duodenum to avoid a potential proteolysis of the C-terminal domain in the stomach. The rats were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine, their stomach was ligaturated, and a catheter was inserted in their duodenum. The test meal (1.5 ml) was infused into the duodenum for 30 min using a peristaltic pump. For the test group (n = 14) 0.1 mg of porcine C-terminal domain in 0.5 ml of water was mixed with the meal, whereas only 0.5 ml of water was added to the meal of the control group (n = 17). The rats were kept anesthetized during the experiment. They were killed after 2 h of digestion, and their intestinal content was analyzed as above mentioned. 14C radioactivity was measured by dual scintillation counting in the presence of 15 ml of either Pico-Fluor 40 or Insta-Fluor liquid scintillation (Packard, France) in a scintillation spectrometer (Packard 1600 TR) with an external standard for quench correction. Results were expressed in disintegration per min (dpm). The statistical significance of the results was analyzed by the one-way analysis of variance and the difference among treatment groups were assessed by Fischer's test (14Winer B. Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. McGraw-Hill, New York, NY1971Google Scholar). Differences associated with a p value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The C-terminal domain was obtained from limited proteolysis of native porcine lipase and purified as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE analysis, amino acid composition (data not shown), N-terminal sequencing (Ala-Arg-Trp-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Val-Ser) indicated that the purified domain corresponds to the expected intact domain (Ala337–Cys445, using the porcine lipase numbering system, Ref. 5Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18007-18016Google Scholar). Based on the molecular mass (12,850 Da) determined by mass spectrometry experiments, the sequence400FIWYNNNVI408 has been corrected to400FIWYNNVI407. The ability of the purified domain to properly bind colipase was checked by spectrofluorometry as previously reported (9Ayvazian L. Crenon I. Granon S. Chapus C. Kerfelec B. Protein Eng... 1996; 9: 707-711Google Scholar). In solution, the isolated domain was shown to display an affinity for colipase similar to that of lipase (Kd ∼10−6m). The influence of the C-terminal domain on the rate of hydrolysis of emulsified tributyrin by native lipase was investigated using either submicellar or supramicellar NaTDC concentrations. In all the experiments, an equimolar ratio of lipase relative to colipase was used. As shown in Fig. 1, in the presence of NaTDC micelles, addition of the C-terminal domain leads to a noticeable inhibition of lipase activity. The inhibition efficiency, low around the NaTDC critical micellar concentration (CMC ∼1 mm), increases with the NaTDC concentration up to 4 mm. Beyond this concentration, no more significant variation is observed. For each NaTDC concentration, increasing the C-terminal domain concentration results in an hyperbolic inhibition plot from which a plateau value and an apparent inhibition constant (Ki app) corresponding to 50% of the plateau value can be determined. Analysis of the inhibition parameters reported in TableII reveals that the affinity between the C-terminal domain and colipase is increased in the presence of micelles by at least one order of magnitude as compared with the affinity between both partners in the absence of micelles. As well, the plateau value varies with the micelle concentration to reach 70–75% inhibition of the lipase activity at 4 mm NaTDC.Table IIInfluence of the NaTDC concentration on the kinetic parameters of lipase inhibition by the isolated C-terminal domainNaTDCKi appLipase inhibition plateau valuemm10−7m%1167 ± 4450.8 ± 7.829.9 ± 6.265 ± 1041.3 ± 0.376.2 ± 6.062.0 ± 0.774.5 ± 7.081.6 ± 0.476.8 ± 4.0The plateau and Ki app values were determined from the inhibition plots (Fig. 1). The plateau values are expressed in percent of lipase inhibition. Ki app represents the C-terminal domain concentration required to reach 50% of the plateau value. Open table in a new tab The plateau and Ki app values were determined from the inhibition plots (Fig. 1). The plateau values are expressed in percent of lipase inhibition. Ki app represents the C-terminal domain concentration required to reach 50% of the plateau value. Lipase inhibition by the C-terminal domain can be reversed by addition of a large molar excess of colipase relative to lipase. This finding is consistent with a competition between lipase and the C-terminal domain for colipase. Below the CMC, no significant inhibition of the lipase activity is observed unless a large amount of C-terminal domain is added. For instance, at 0.5 mm NaTDC, only 9% inhibition is observed for a C-terminal domain concentration of 2 × 10−5m as compared with 70–75% inhibition at 4 mm NaTDC. The addition order of the C-terminal domain in the kinetic assays (before or after lipase) does not noticeably affect its inhibitory effect. The influence of the nature of the substrate (short or long chain triglycerides) on the inhibitory efficiency of the C-terminal domain was investigated using triolein as substrate. As reported for tributyrin, the presence of micelles is required to observe a significant lipase inhibition. The plateau andKi app values obtained for 4 mmNaTDC are close to those determined with emulsified tributyrin (TableIII).Table IIIEffect of simple and mixed micelles on the kinetic parameters of lipase inhibition by the isolated C-terminal domainMicelle compositionKi appPlateau value10−7m%4 mm NaTDC1.9 ± 0.292.2 ± 4.26 mm total bile salts2.2 ± 0.593.2 ± 7.46 mm total bile salts + 0.5 mm lecithin1.98 ± 0.496.9 ± 6.06 mm total bile salts + 0.5 mm lecithin + 5 mm oleic acid1.9 ± 0.999.7 ± 5The kinetic parameters of inhibition (plateau value andKi app) were determined as reported in Table II. Inhibition of lipase activity was potentiometrically determined at 25 °C and pH 8.5 using 10 mm emulsified triolein as substrate in the presence of colipase and increasing amounts of C-terminal domain. The lipase and colipase concentrations were in the range of 10−9m. The lipase activity was measured in the presence of simple or mixed micelles. The composition of the total bile salt mixture is described in “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters of inhibition (plateau value andKi app) were determined as reported in Table II. Inhibition of lipase activity was potentiometrically determined at 25 °C and pH 8.5 using 10 mm emulsified triolein as substrate in the presence of colipase and increasing amounts of C-terminal domain. The lipase and colipase concentrations were in the range of 10−9m. The lipase activity was measured in the presence of simple or mixed micelles. The composition of the total bile salt mixture is described in “Experimental Procedures.” To approach the physiological conditions of intestinal lipolysis, we tested the inhibitory behavior of the C-terminal domain in the presence of different mixed micelles, using 10 mm emulsified triolein as substrate. The concentration of total bile salts (6 mm), phospholipids (0.5 mm), and/or oleic acid (5 mm) approximated concentrations found in duodenum during digestion. Hyperbolic inhibition plots were still obtained from which theKi app and plateau values were determined. Analysis of these parameters reveals that the composition of the micelles has no significant influence on the inhibitory efficiency of the C-terminal domain. This finding is to be correlated to a recent work showing that the size rather than the chemical nature is a critical parameter for the micelle to be accommodated in the cavity of the lipase-colipase-micelle ternary complex (15Pignol D. Ayvazian L. Kerfelec B. Timmins P. Crenon I. Hermoso J. Fontecilla-Camps J. Chapus C. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 257: 4220-4224Google Scholar). Using 0.11m emulsified tributyrin and mixed micelles made of either 6 mm total bile salts or 6 mm total bile salts and 0.5 mm lecithin, plateau values of inhibition ranging from 75 to 90% were observed. The Ki app is quite unaffected by the composition of the micelles (∼2 × 10−7m). To demonstrate the formation of such a complex, we have performed gel filtration experiments on the C-terminal domain either alone or mixed with colipase in the absence or in the presence of NaTDC micelles. A 1.5 molar excess of C-terminal domain relative to colipase was used in the C-terminal domain/colipase mixtures to compare the chromatographic behavior of complexed and uncomplexed C-terminal domain. As shown in Fig. 2, molecular sieving of colipase/C-terminal domain mixtures, with or without NaTDC micelles, yields two peaks. In each case, using SDS-PAGE analysis, the first eluted peak was shown to contain both proteins, indicating the formation of a colipase-C-terminal domain complex, the molar excess of C-terminal domain being eluted under the second peak. However, the elution volume of the colipase-C-terminal domain complex in the presence of micelles is lower than that observed in the absence of micelles. This finding is consistent with an increase in molecular size of the complex likely caused by the binding to NaTDC micelles. By contrast, the elution volume of the C-terminal domain is not significantly affected by the presence of micelles, indicating that this domain does not interact with a micelle. The same experiments were performed with colipase and lipase. To normalize all the data, theKav values were determined (TableIV).Table IVKav values for colipase, C-terminal domain and lipaseMolecular speciesKavMr4-aThe molecular mass of the complexes involving a NaTDC micelle was estimated assuming a stoichiometry of 1 micelle per protein complex [7].

The molecular mass of a NaTDC micelle is around 8300 Da. Open table in a new tab Analysis of these values clearly shows that the C-terminal domain-colipase complex has a Kav value significantly lower in the presence of micelles than in the absence of micelles. Moreover, as expected from the respective molecular size of the two complexes, the lipase-colipase-micelle complex has a still lower Kav value than that of the colipase-C-terminal domain complex in the presence of micelles. These findings, together with the well known observation that colipase, in contrast to the C-terminal domain, can bind a micelle, are consistent with the formation of a ternary complex associating the C-terminal domain, colipase, and a micelle. Preliminary in vivo experiments were performed on rats as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The porcine C-terminal domain was either given by mouth or infused in the duodenum after ligature of the stomach. In vitro assays showed that the porcine C-terminal domain is stable for hours at pH values ranging from 2.0 to 9.5 and presents a moderate sensitivity to pepsin (data not shown). Therefore, in a first set of experiments, the C-terminal domain was mixed to the test meal and orally given to the rats. After 3.5 h of digestion, the rats were killed. A 90% gastric emptying was observed after 3.5 h of digestion for both the control rats and the rats treated with 1 mg of C-terminal domain, indicating that the presence of the C-terminal domain has no effect on the gastric emptying. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the total14C radioactivity (associated with mono, di, and triolein) found in the intestine of the rats treated with the C-terminal domain is significantly higher than that found in the intestine of the rats of the control group. This finding is indicative of a lower extent of triolein hydrolysis in the presence of the C-terminal domain. No radioactivity was found in the cecum, as expected. In the second set of experiments, the C-terminal domain was infused in the duodenum. After 2 h of digestion, the total 14C radioactivity recovered in the intestine of the rats treated with the C-terminal domain was again higher than that of the control group (Fig.3 B). It must be stressed that in this case the same extent of inhibition of lipolysis is obtained with a 10-fold lower dose of C-terminal domain (0.1 mg instead of 1 mg per rat). These results clearly demonstrate that the C-terminal domain behaves as a lipase inhibitor in vivo. These results clearly demonstrate that in vitro under conditions approximating the physiological conditions, the isolated C-terminal domain of lipase behaves as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme, provided either simple or mixed micelles are present. The C-terminal domain acts as a direct competitor of lipase by binding colipase thus diverting it from its lipase-anchoring function. The presence of micelles triggers the inhibitory efficiency of the C-terminal domain by increasing the affinity between both partners through supplementary interactions. This is consistent with the role of the micelle in the ternary complex described by Hermoso et al. (7Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 5531-5536Google Scholar). The direct binding of a micelle to the C-terminal domain-colipase complex has been shown by molecular sieving experiments. Based on the decrease of the Kavvalue of the C-terminal domain-colipase complex in the presence of micelles and on the well established finding that colipase possesses a specific lipase binding site distinct from its micelle binding site, it can be proposed that a ternary complex associating the C-terminal domain, colipase, and a single micelle is formed in solution. The size of the micelle rather than its chemical nature is determinant for the formation of such a complex as previously observed for the lipase-colipase-micelle ternary complex. The finding that the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal domain does not depend upon the nature of the substrate is in agreement with previous experimental data showing that the lipase C-terminal domain/colipase binding does not directly involve the lipid/water interface and further supports the assumption that the ternary complex (C-terminal domain-colipase-micelle) is formed in solution. Therefore, we propose that this inhibitory effect is likely to proceed through the formation of an inactive C-terminal domain-colipase-micelle complex in which by analogy with the active lipase ternary complex the micelle is located in the cavity delineated by the C-terminal domain and colipase (Fig. 4). In such a model, the domain behaves as a “protein lure” toward colipase, lowering the amount of active lipase/colipase/micelle ternary complex and thus reducing intestinal fat absorption. Preliminary trials performed on rats appear promising for the use of the C-terminal domain as an inhibitor of lipolysis in vivo. A similar decrease of lipolysis was observed when the animals were treated by this domain either orally or by infusion in the duodenum after ligature of the stomach, thus implying that the C-terminal domain behaves as an effective inhibitor of lipolysis in the intestine rather than in the upper part of the digestive tract. This finding emphasizes the specificity of the domain toward the pancreatic lipase/colipase system. These results are also consistent with a noticeable resistance of the domain to proteolysis by pancreatic proteases in the intestine, as previously observed in vitro (16Abousalham K. Chaillan C. Kerfelec B. Foglizzo E. Chapus C. Prot. Eng... 1991; 5: 105-111Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of the porcine C-terminal domain in the rat confirms previous findings showing that the lipase/colipase binding is well conserved among species (17Sternby B. Borgström B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol... 1981; 68B: 15-18Google Scholar, 18Rathelot J. Julien R. Bosc-Bierne I. Gargouri Y. Canioni P. Sarda L. Biochimie ( Paris ).. 1981; 63: 227-234Google Scholar). Therefore, these in vivo results corroborate the mode of inhibition postulated in vitro, namely the C-terminal domain behaves as a specific noncovalent inhibitor of pancreatic lipase by acting as a “protein lure” toward colipase, in contrast to active site-directed inhibitors, which can act on a large number of secretory and intracellular mammalian lipases (19Hadvary P. Lengsfeld H. Wolfer H. Biochem. J... 1988; 256: 357-361Google Scholar, 20Guerciolini R. Int. J. Ob... 1997; 21: 12-23Google Scholar). In conclusion, this work describes a new specific mild way to control the activity of the pancreatic lipase/colipase system and further emphasizes the importance of the bile micelles in lipase/colipase binding. Based on the positive preliminary in vivo results, this work might also offer promising perspectives in the health field because reducing the level of fat absorption by controlling the dietary triglyceride digestion by gastrointestinal lipases is one of the concerns of industrialized countries in the campaign against obesity and some hyperlipidemia (21Laboratoire LAPHAL (1998), International Patent W09830588.Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1984700793,"Adrenal cytochrome P450 C21 in a membrane-reconstituted system catalyzed 21-hydroxylation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone at a rate higher than that for progesterone in the steady state at 37 °C. The rate of product formation in the steady state increased with the concentration of the complex between P450 C21 and the reductase in the membranes. The complex formation was independent of the volume of the reaction, showing that the effective concentrations of the membrane proteins should be defined with the volume of the lipid phase. The rates of conversion of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to the product in a single cycle of the P450 C21 reaction were measured with a reaction rapid quenching device. The first-order rate constant for the conversion of progesterone by P450 C21 was 4.3 ± 0.7 s−1, and that for 17α-hydroxyprogesterone was 1.8 ± 0.5 s−1 at 37 °C. It was found from the analysis of kinetic data that the rate-determining step in 21-hydroxylation of progesterone in the steady state was the dissociation of product from P450 C21, whereas the conversion to deoxycortisol was the rate-determining step in the reaction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. The difference in the rate-determining steps in the reactions for the two substrates was clearly demonstrated in the pre-steady-state kinetics. Adrenal cytochrome P450 C21 in a membrane-reconstituted system catalyzed 21-hydroxylation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone at a rate higher than that for progesterone in the steady state at 37 °C. The rate of product formation in the steady state increased with the concentration of the complex between P450 C21 and the reductase in the membranes. The complex formation was independent of the volume of the reaction, showing that the effective concentrations of the membrane proteins should be defined with the volume of the lipid phase. The rates of conversion of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to the product in a single cycle of the P450 C21 reaction were measured with a reaction rapid quenching device. The first-order rate constant for the conversion of progesterone by P450 C21 was 4.3 ± 0.7 s−1, and that for 17α-hydroxyprogesterone was 1.8 ± 0.5 s−1 at 37 °C. It was found from the analysis of kinetic data that the rate-determining step in 21-hydroxylation of progesterone in the steady state was the dissociation of product from P450 C21, whereas the conversion to deoxycortisol was the rate-determining step in the reaction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. The difference in the rate-determining steps in the reactions for the two substrates was clearly demonstrated in the pre-steady-state kinetics. cytochrome P450 having ethanol oxidation activity cytochrome P450 having steroid 21-hydroxylase activity cytochrome P450 having steroid 11β-hydroxylase activity cytochrome P450 having steroid 17α-hydroxylase activity high performance liquid chromatography Microsomal cytochrome P450 isozymes are integral membrane proteins responsible for the metabolism of various exogenous and endogenous compounds, including steroid hormones. The monooxygenase reaction of P450 requires two electrons and an oxygen molecule. NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in the microsomal membranes supplies the first and the second electrons to P450s in the same membrane. Although the supply of the second electron to P450 is often the rate-limiting step in P450 reactions, results of recent experiments have revealed that some P450 reactions have rate-determining steps other than in the electron supply (1Bell L.C.

P450 2E1 catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid via acetaldehyde, in which about 90% of the intermediate acetaldehyde is directly converted to acetic acid without dissociation from the active site of the enzyme (2Bell-Parikh L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23833-23840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). They showed for the first time in P450 reactions that the reactions for two substrates catalyzed by one molecular species of P450 could have different rate-determining steps (1Bell L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29643-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We demonstrated in studies on the successive reactions of P450 11β and P450 17α that the rates of product formation in the steady state were regulated by the rates of product release from the enzymes (3Imai T. Yamazaki T. Kominami S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8097-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Yamazaki T. Ohno T. Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Imai T. Kominami S.

P450 17α and P450 11β catalyze multistep reactions for the formation of androgens and aldosterone, respectively, where the final products are formed from fractions of the intermediates that do not dissociate from the enzymes (3Imai T. Yamazaki T. Kominami S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8097-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Yamazaki T. Ohno T. Sakaki T. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. Imai T. Kominami S.

The same mechanism for diminishing the rate of dissociation of final products from P450 2E1, P450 11β, and P450 17α might decrease the dissociation rates of the intermediates, facilitating the successive monooxygenase reactions in these P450s without the intermediate metabolites leaving the enzyme. It is of interest to examine whether the product release can be the rate-determining step for P450 that does not catalyze multistep reactions.

Rotational diffusion measurement of P450 C21 in liposomal membranes revealed a complex formation with the reductase (21Ohta Y. Kawato S. Tagashira H. Takemori S. Kominami S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12680-12687Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we obtained experimental evidence that the effective concentrations of P450 C21 and NADPH-P450 reductase for the complex formation should be defined with the volume of the lipid phase of the membranes rather than the total volume of the reaction solution.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Shinzawa K. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Some of the progesterone originally produced from cholesterol is hydroxylated to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, a part of which is further metabolized to androstenedione without dissociation from P450 17α (5Tagashira H. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10939-10945Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone are the physiological substrates for P450 C21 and are converted to deoxycorticosterone and deoxycortisol, respectively. The activity of P450 C21 for the reaction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is higher than that for progesterone in bovine and guinea pig microsomes and also in the reconstituted systems (23Higuchi A. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Kominami S. Ochi H. Kobayashi Y. Takemori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3386-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the activities of P450 C21 in the reactions of the two substrates has been investigated by various methods. The rate of first electron transfer from the reductase to P450 C21 in the presence of progesterone was not much different from that in the presence of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, where the high spin content of the P450 C21–17α-hydroxyprogesterone complex was higher than that of the P450 C21-progesterone complex (28Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The rates of substrate binding to P450 C21 in liposomal membranes do not differ much between the two substrates (29Kominami S. Itoh Y. Takemori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2077-2083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate why the activity of P450 C21 in the steady state is higher for 17α-hydroxyprogesterone than for progesterone, it is necessary to determine the rate-determining step in 21-hydroxylation reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. We performed kinetic studies on P450 C21-catalyzing hydroxylation reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in the steady state, in single turnover experimental conditions, and in the pre-steady state. Cytochrome P450 C21 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase were purified from bovine adrenocortical and hepatic microsomes, respectively, according to methods described previously (24Kominami S. Ochi H. Kobayashi Y. Takemori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3386-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Takemori S. Kominami S. Nozaki M. Yamamoto S. Ishimura Y. Coon M, J. Ernster I. Estabrook R.W. Oxygenase and Oxygen Metabolism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 403-408Google Scholar). The purified P450 C21 was incorporated into unilamellar vesicular membranes by the cholate dialysis method using phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine at a molar ratio of 5:3:1 (31Kominami S. Inoue S. Higuchi A. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). P450 C21 proteoliposomes used in this experiment contained about 0.65 nmol of P450 C21 per mg of the phospholipids, which corresponds to one molecule of P450 C21 in about 2000 molecules of phospholipids. A certain amount of the reductase was incorporated in the P450 C21 proteoliposomes by incubation with the preformed P450 C21 proteoliposomes at 0 °C for 1 h (32Kominami S. Ikushiro S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The amount of P450 in the reaction solution was determined from the dithionite-reduced CO difference spectra (33Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the concentration of P450 in the membrane reconstituted system is expressed in mol of P450/liter of the lipid phase of the membranes under the assumption that 1 g of phospholipids occupies 1 ml (34Huang C. Mason J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The rates of 21-hydroxylation of P450 C21 proteoliposomes for progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone were measured at 37 °C using3H-labeled substrates (31Kominami S. Inoue S. Higuchi A. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In general, 0.5 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) contained 10 pmol of P450 C21 and various amounts of the reductase (2.5–25 pmol) in the liposomal membranes (0.015 mg of phospholipids), 10 nmol of progesterone or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with corresponding3H-labeled steroid (0.5 μCi), and 0.1 mmEDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 nmol of NADPH and terminated by mixing with 1 ml of chloroform containing14C-labeled androstenedione (0.005 μCi). The radioactivity of 14C-labeled androstenedione was used for the estimation of the recovery of steroids in the assay procedures. The extracted steroids were separated with an HPLC system described previously (23Higuchi A. Kominami S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Kominami S. Inoue S. Higuchi A. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of conversion from progesterone or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to the 21-hydroxylated product under single turnover reaction conditions, rapid quenching experiments were performed at 37 °C with a rapid quenching device (UNISOKU MX-200) equipped with four cylinders and two mixers (35Iwanaga T. Yamazaki T. Kominami S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16629-16635Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Solutions A and B were mixed rapidly with mixer 1 and stored in a reaction coil. The reacted solution was pushed out from the coil with solution C and was mixed rapidly in mixer 2 with solution D, the termination solution. In the single turnover experiment of P450 C21, solution A (100 μl) contained 50 pmol of P450 C21 proteoliposomes with various amounts of the reductase (50–300 pmol) and 2.5 pmol of the 3H-substrate (0.25 μCi) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 0.1 mm EDTA. Solution B (100 μl) contained 100 nmol of NADPH and 100 nmol of the unlabeled substrate in the buffer. Solution C (200 μl) was the buffer solution, and solution D (200 μl) was 1m HCl. Under these experimental conditions, only the reaction of 3H-substrate bound to P450 C21 at the initial stage of the reaction could be detected. 3H-substrate or3H-product dissociated from P450 C21 could not be metabolized again, because of the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled substrate in the reaction solution. The steroids were extracted with chloroform after termination of the reaction and separated by HPLC. The pre-steady-state kinetics of P450 C21-catalyzing reactions were studied using a UNISOKU MX-200. Solution A (100 μl) contained 5 pmol of P450 C21 proteoliposomes with 5 pmol of the reductase and 100 pmol of3H-substrate (1 μCi) in the reaction buffer. Solution B (100 μl) contained 10 nmol of NADPH but did not contain an unlabeled substrate. The contents of solutions C and D are the same as those in the single turnover experiments. In these reaction conditions, multicycle turnover reactions of P450 C21 can occur. The time courses of P450 C21-catalyzing reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone were measured in the initial 3 s at 37 °C. Computer simulations for the pre-steady-state kinetics were performed with HopKINSIM version 1.7.2 provided by D. Wachsstock (Johns Hopkins University) using a Macintosh computer (iMac; Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, CA) equipped with FPU 3.07 (John Neil & Associates, Cupertino, CA) (36Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F.

[1,2,6,7-3H]progesterone and [4-14C]androstenedione were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 17α-[3H]Hydroxyprogesterone was produced from 3H-labeled progesterone by an enzymatic reaction using P450 17α-proteolipsomes and purified with HPLC (31Kominami S. Inoue S. Higuchi A. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).l-α-Phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk was obtained from Sigma, and l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine from egg yolk andl-α-phosphatidylserine from bovine spinal cord were from Lipid Products (Surrey, United Kingdom). Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. The reaction system of P450 C21 was reconstituted in liposomal membranes. The incorporation of P450 C21 and NADPH-P450 reductase in the liposome membranes was confirmed by density gradient centrifugation (31Kominami S. Inoue S. Higuchi A. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Kominami S. Ikushiro S. Takemori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Almost all of the P450 C21 in the proteoliposomes is reduced upon the addition of the reductase and NADPH, suggesting that the heme domain of P450 C21 interacts with the functional domain of the reductase on the outer surface of the vesicles. Fig.1 a shows the time courses of 21-hydroxylation of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone catalyzed by P450 C21 at 37 °C in the presence of NADPH-P450 reductase at an equimolar amount of P450 C21 (10 pmol) in the liposome membranes (15 μg of phospholipids in 0.5 ml of reaction solution). The amounts of deoxycortisol and deoxycorticosterone, which were the 21-hydroxylated products from 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone, respectively, increased linearly with the reaction time. The rates of product formation by P450 C21, which were calculated from the slopes of the lines, were 0.33 ± 0.04 and 0.17 ± 0.03 nmol/min for 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone, respectively. The rates of product formation both from progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone were not altered by change in the volume of the reaction solution as long as the total amounts of P450 C21, the reductase, and phospholipids were kept constant in the reaction solution, as shown in Fig. 1 b. The rate of product formation in the steady state increased hyperbolically with the amount of the reductase in the membranes as shown in Fig.2, where the rate for 17α-hydroxyprogesterone was almost twice that for progesterone in the concentration range observed. An increase in the rate of product formation by various P450s has been observed with the increase in the amount of the reductase in the reaction solution and has been attributed to formation of an active complex between P450 and the reductase (14Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Miwa G.T. West S.B. Huang M. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5695-5700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant of the active P450 C21-reductase complex (1:1, mol/mol) was estimated by the method of Miwa et al. (15Miwa G.T. West S.B. Huang M. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5695-5700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained 16 ± 4 and 15 ± 4 nm for Kd(app), the apparent dissociation constants for the P450 C21-reductase complex, from the dependence of the rates of 21-hydroxylations of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone, respectively. The apparent dissociation constants were calculated under the assumption that P450 C21 and the reductase are distributed homogeneously in the reaction solution. These Kd(app) values are a little smaller than those reported for other P450 systems (14Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Muller-Enoch D. Churchill P. Fleischer S. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8174-8182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Below, we discuss the calculation of dissociation constants of the complex using effective concentrations of the enzymes defined with the volume of lipid phase of the membranes. Vmax, which is the rate in the presence of an excess amount of the reductase with 0.01 nmol of P450 C21, was 0.78 ± 0.06 nmol of deoxycortisol produced per min for the reaction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 0.48 ± 0.06 nmol of deoxycorticosterone produced per min for progesterone. Thelines in Fig. 2 are the theoretical curves drawn with the above values. It was remarkable that Vmax was about 2 times higher for the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone reaction than for the progesterone reaction but that Kd(app) was about the same for both substrates, suggesting that the difference in the substrates had little effect on the interaction between P450 C21 and the reductase. To obtain the rate of conversion of the substrate to the 21-hydroxylated product in the single turnover reaction, a solution containing a P450-reductase-3H-substrate ternary complex was mixed rapidly with excess amounts of NADPH and the unlabeled substrate. Since3H-substrate and3H-products once released from the enzyme do not rebind to P450 C21 in the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled substrate, only the change in the3H-substrate in the P450 C21-reductase complex at the initiation of the reaction is observable under these conditions. Fig.3, a and b, shows the time courses of reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, respectively, under the single turnover conditions at 37 °C. The amount of [3H]progesterone decreased exponentially with the reaction time, and the decrease corresponded exactly to the increase in 21-hydroxylated3H-product, [3H]deoxycorticosterone. The decrease in 17α-[3H]hydroxyprogesterone and the corresponding increase in [3H]deoxycortisol were apparently slower than those for progesterone. The first-order rate constants for reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, which were obtained by fitting the observed data to single exponential curves, were 4.3 and 1.8 s−1, respectively. It is concluded that the higher activity of P450 C21 for the reaction of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in the steady state is not due to the higher conversion rate of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone than that of progesterone. The time courses for reactions of progesterone in the single turnover conditions were also dependent on the amount of the reductase in the reaction solution as shown in Fig. 4. The amount of [3H]progesterone that was converted to [3H]deoxycorticosterone in the single turnover reaction increased with the amount of the reductase in the membranes, but the rate of the conversion did not vary, remaining 4.0 ± 0.5 s−1. The increase in the amount of product in the single turnover condition could be attributed to the increase in the amount of active complex in the reaction solution.Figure 4Effects of the amount of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase on the single turnover experiments for the conversion of progesterone (open symbols) to deoxycorticosterone (closed symbols) catalyzed by P450 C21 proteoliposomes.

A solution (100 μl) containing equimolar amounts of P450 C21 and the reductase (5 pmol) and 100 pmol of radioactive substrate was mixed rapidly with an equal volume of NADPH solution, and the conversions of substrates were measured in the range of 0–3 s. Fig. 5, a and b, show the conversions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to the products, respectively, in which the amount of deoxycorticosterone increased rapidly in the initial 300 ms with a slower linear increase after that, while the amount of deoxycortisol increased almost linearly up to 3 s. The burst increase of deoxycorticosterone in the pre-steady state showed that the rate of conversion from progesterone to deoxycorticosterone must be significantly faster than the rate of dissociation of product deoxycorticosterone from the enzyme (39Bender M.L. Begue-Canton M.L. Blakeley R.L. Brubacher L.J. Feder J. Gunter C.R. Kezdy F.J. Killheffer Jr., J.V. Marshall T.H. Miller C.G. Roeske R.W. Stoops J.K. J. Am. Chem.

If P450 C21 and the reductase were distributed homogeneously in the reaction solution, the effective concentrations of P450 C21 and the reductase would be decreased to one-tenth by a 10-fold increase in the volume of the reaction solution. Fig. 1 b shows, however, that there was almost no change in the rate of product formation with an increase in the volume of the reaction solution, suggesting that the formation of the active complex does not depend on the volume of the reaction solution. The concentrations of P450 C21 and the reductase in the lipid phase of the membranes are not affected by change in the volume of the reaction solution as long as the absolute amounts of P450 C21, the reductase, and the phospholipids are kept constant. P450 C21 proteoliposomes contain 1 mol of P450 C21 in 2000 × 770 g of phospholipids, where 770 is the average molecular weight of the phospholipids. The concentration of P450 C21 was 0.65 mm in the lipid phase under the assumption that 1 g of phospholipids occupies 1 ml of the volume in the membranes (34Huang C. Mason J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constants, Kd(app), for P450 C21-reductase complex were calculated from the reductase dependence of the rate of product formation under the assumption of a homogeneous distribution of enzymes in the reaction solution using the equation Kd(app) = ((P/V)(R/V))/(PR/V), where P, R, and PR represent the absolute amounts (mol) of free P450C21, free reductase, and P450 C21-reductase complex, respectively, and V is the volume of the reaction solution (0.0005 liters in Fig. 2). The amount of P450 C21-reductase complex can be calculated using the equationPR (mol) = (observed rate of product formation/Vmax) × (total amount of P450 C21 (mol)), where Vmax is the rate when all of the P450 C21 is in the form of a complex with the reductase. The concentration of P450 C21 in the lipid phase can be defined asP/Lip, where Lip represents the volume in liters of the lipid phase of the membranes. The dissociation constant of the complex defined in the lipid phase can be written asKd(lip) = ((P/Lip)(R/Lip))/(PR/Lip) = Kd(app) × (V/Lip) (29Kominami S. Itoh Y. Takemori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2077-2083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments for Fig. 2 using 10 pmol of P450 C21, the volume of the lipid phase can be calculated as 10 × 10−12 × 2000 × 770 ml, and Vis 0.5 ml. The value for V/Lip is 3.2 × 104, and the value for Kd(lip) becomes 520 ± 120 μm for P450 C21-reductase complex, which must be the real dissociation constant for the P450 C21-reductase complex in the liposome membranes. A similar Kd(lip) value, about 0.5 mm, is calculated for a hepatic P450-reductase complex in egg yolk liposomes from the data of Miwa and Lu (14Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the experiments for Fig. 4, the amount of P450 C21 was kept constant (50 pmol in 0.077 mg of phospholipids), and the amount of reductase was increased from 50 to 100 and then to 300 pmol. The amount of [3H]progesterone hydroxylated by P450 C21 in the single turnover reaction increased with the amount of the reductase in the liposome membranes, but the rate of conversion of [3H]progesterone did not change. [3H]Deoxycorticosterone must be produced from the active ternary complex of P450 C21-[3H]progesterone-reductase that exists at the initial stage of the reaction. The amounts of active complex between P450 C21 and the reductase in the lipid phase can be calculated using the equation Kd(lip) = ((Pt −PR)/Lip)(Rt −PR)/Lip)/(PR/Lip), wherePt and Rt represent the total amounts of P450 C21 and the reductase (mol) in the reaction solution, respectively, andLip is 7.7 × 10−8 liters for the experiments in Fig. 4. The amounts of complex were calculated usingKd(lip) = 520 μm to be 21, 31, and 43 pmol in the presence of 50, 100, and 300 pmol of the reductase with 50 pmol of P450 C21 in the membranes, respectively. These are almost proportional to the amounts of product formed in the single turnover reactions (0.4, 0.55, and 0.7 pmol, respectively) in Fig. 4. The small amounts of product formation are attributed to the low concentration of 3H-substrate (2.5 pmol) in the reaction solution. On the other hand, in the model of P450 C21 and the reductase being distributed homogeneously in the reaction solution, the amounts of the complex calculated as 39, 47, and 49.4 pmol usingKd(app) do not increase significantly with an increase in the amount of the reductase. Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that the effective concentrations of the membrane proteins should be defined in the lipid phase. To analyze the reaction mechanism of P450 C21 in the steady state, we divided one cycle of the P450 C21 reaction into three steps, as shown in Fig. 6. It is assumed that the complex between P450 C21 and the reductase is the active species in the reaction. The presence of an excess amount of the substrate prevents reactions in the reverse direction. The rate for the conversion of the substrate to the product obtained in the single turnover experiment corresponds to k2. The steady-state velocity of product formation can be written as follows (40Roberts D.V. Enzyme Kinetics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1977: 35-40Google Scholar), v=k1k2k3[S][E0]/((k3k2+k1[S](k2+k3))Equation 1 where [E0] represents the concentration of the active complex. This equation can be simplified asv/[E0] =k2 k3/(k2+ k3) in the presence of an excess amount of substrate, wherek2 k3/k1[S] is much smaller than k2 + k3. We can calculate the values of k3 for the reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in the steady state using the observed values of Vmax for v, the rates of conversion of the substrate, k2, and the total amount of P450 C21 in the reaction solution. In the presence of an excess amount of the reductase, nearly all P450 C21 in the reaction solution must be in the form of an active complex, and the rate of product formation can be expressed as Vmax. The calculated values for k3 are listed together with the values of Vmax andk2 in TableI. It is quite interesting that the rate of dissociation of the product from the enzyme,k3, was about one-fourth less than the rate of the conversion of the substrate, k2, in the reaction of progesterone, whereas k3 was about 2.5 times larger than k2 for 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It is clarified that the rate-determining steps for the reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone are the dissociation of the product and the conversion of the substrate, respectively.Table IKinetic parameters for P450 C21 reactions in the membrane reconstituted systemSubstrateVmaxk2k3nmol product/mins−1s−1Progesterone0.48 ± 0.064.3 ± 0.71.0 ± 0.217α-Hydroxyprogesterone0.78 ± 0.061.8 ± 0.54.5 ± 0.8Vmax is the rate of product formation by 10 pmol of P450 C21 in the presence of an excess amount of the reductase in the membranes. k2 is the rate constant for the conversion of the substrate to the product, and k3is that for the product dissociation from P450 C21-reductase complex in the scheme shown in Fig. 6. Values are means ± S.D. of at least triplicate determinations. The details of the calculation are described under “Discussion.” Open table in a new tab Vmax is the rate of product formation by 10 pmol of P450 C21 in the presence of an excess amount of the reductase in the membranes. k2 is the rate constant for the conversion of the substrate to the product, and k3is that for the product dissociation from P450 C21-reductase complex in the scheme shown in Fig. 6. Values are means ± S.D. of at least triplicate determinations. The details of the calculation are described under “Discussion.” The difference in the rate-determining steps in P450 C21 reactions must affect the pre-steady-state kinetics of the reactions of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (1Bell L.C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29643-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The time courses of product formation from progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in the range of 0–3 s are shown in Fig. 5, a and b, respectively. As discussed above, the rate of conversion of progesterone to the product in the active complex is about 4 times faster than the dissociation of deoxycorticosterone from the active complex, which is reflected by the burst and the subsequent slow linear increase of the product. On the other hand, the conversion of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to deoxycortisol is the slowest step in the reaction cycle, and we did not observe any burst formation of deoxycortisol. The lines in Fig. 5 are the simulated curves obtained using the simulation program HopKINSIM version 1.7.2 with the rate constants in Table I, where the value of k1was selected to be 0.02 (nm·s)−1for the binding of both progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (29Kominami S.

The simulation study shows that the burst increase in the product formation is due to the fast conversion of the substrate to the product with subsequent slow dissociation of the product from the enzyme. The successive reactions catalyzed by P450 2E1, P450 11β, and P450 17α had as rate-determining steps the dissociation of the products, with slow dissociation of intermediate products facilitating the further monooxygenation of intermediates without dissociation from the enzyme active sites (2Bell-Parikh L.C.

The rate-determining step in the hydroxylation reaction of progesterone catalyzed by P450 C21 is the product dissociation, and P450 C21 does not catalyze a multistep reaction. This means that the rate-determining product release from the enzymes was not restricted to the successive reactions. The rate-determining product release might not be a special phenomenon in P450 reactions. White and Coon (41White R.E. Coon M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 315-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) had speculated some 20 years ago that the difference in the activity of one species of P450 for different substrates might be explained by the difference in the product dissociation rate. The difference in the rates of product release might be due to the difference in the hydrophobicities of the products (42Al-Gailany K.A.S. Houston J.B. Bridges J.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1978; 27: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Backes W.I. Canady W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7213-7227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxycortisol has two hydroxyl groups, but deoxycorticosterone has only one. It is not surprising that deoxycortisol dissociates faster from P450 C21 than the more hydrophobic deoxycorticosterone (29Kominami S. Itoh Y. Takemori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2077-2083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it could be the rate-determining step in the P450 reaction, much more attention should be paid to the product dissociation from P450s."

This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a direct interaction of these proteins in the absence of DNA. No 1:1 complex was detected over a wide range of CAP concentrations, suggesting that binding is highly cooperative. Complex formation is stimulated by cAMP, with a net uptake of 1 equivalent of cAMP per molecule of CAP bound. Substitution of the dimeric lacI-18 mutant repressor for tetrameric wild-type repressor completely eliminates detectable binding. We therefore propose that CAP binds the cleft between dimeric units in the repressor tetramer. CAP-lac repressor interactions may play important roles in regulatory events that take place at overlapping CAP and repressor binding sites in the lactose promoter.

The lacpromoter region contains an array of binding sites positioned to allow bound proteins to interact in limited and specific ways. Within a 120-base pair sequence are located two binding sites for thelac repressor, two for CAP,1 and two for RNA polymerase (Fig. 1). Proteins occupying these sites can affect the affinities of other proteins for neighboring sites and can influence, via protein- or DNA-allostery, the catalytic activities of RNA polymerase. For example, under some in vitro conditions, lac repressor bound to operator 1 stimulates the binding of RNA polymerase to P1 (1Straney S.B. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 699-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but appears to inhibit promoter clearance and thus, mature RNA synthesis (2Lee J. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1991; 66: 793-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Under other higher [salt] solution conditions, the binding oflac repressor and RNA polymerase in the P1-operator 1 region appears to be mutually exclusive (Ref. 3Schlax P.J. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and references cited therein). Little is known about the interactions of lac repressor and CAP in this regulatory system. The DNA surfaces occupied by CAP and repressor in the CAP site 2/operator 1 region of the promoter are coincident, whereas those in the CAP site 1/operator 3 region overlap significantly (see Fig. 1). In vitro, CAP bound at CAP site 1 interacts cooperatively with repressor at operator 1 (4Hudson J.M. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Vossen K.M. Stickle D.F. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and alters the DNase I protection pattern of repressor bound at operator 3 (6Fried M.G. Hudson J.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1930-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas CAP at CAP site 2 is displaced when lacrepressor binds operator 1. 2M. Fried, unpublished results. Although this evidence supports regulatory models in which CAP andlac repressor interact, it does not allow distinction between models in which the proteins interact directly, and ones in which interactions are indirect (mediated, for example, by DNA conformation change). In addition, it does not address the possibility that CAP and lac repressor interact when they are not DNA bound. To determine whether lac repressor and CAP can interact directly, we have performed equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation over wide ranges of [CAP] and [lacrepressor] and the physiological range of [cAMP]. Our results show that CAP binds lac repressor in a [cAMP]-dependent manner and that DNA is not required for the interaction. CAP was prepared as previously described (5Vossen K.M. Stickle D.F. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE, 45% active in cAMP-dependent binding to lac promoter CAP site 1 and >80% active in nonspecific DNA binding. Samples of two preparations of wild-type lac repressor and two preparations of lacI-18 mutant repressor were kindly provided Dr. Kathleen Matthews. The wild-type repressor was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and >50% active in lac operator binding. The lacI-18 mutant repressor was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and was ∼30% active inlac operator binding (5Vossen K.M. Stickle D.F. Fried M.G. J. Mol.

CAP and lacrepressor concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using εCAP 280 nm= 3.5 × 104m−1 cm−1 (9Anderson W.B. Schneider A.B. Emmer M. Perlman R.L. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5929-5937Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and εrepressor subunit 280 nm = 2.2 × 104m−1 cm−1 (10Butler A.P. Revzin A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Samples were brought to dialysis equilibrium with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8 at 4 °C, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 1 μm leupeptin, supplemented where indicated with cAMP. Samples were centrifuged to equilibrium in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AN-60 rotor. Absorbance values were measured at 280 nm as functions of radial position. Five scans were averaged for each sample at each rotor speed. The approach to equilibrium was considered to be complete when replicate scans separated by ≥ 6 h were indistinguishable. Solvent densities were measured using a Mettler density meter. At sedimentation equilibrium, the absorbance at a specified wavelength and position in the solution column is given by Equation 1 (11McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-Associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar,12Laue T.M. Stafford III., W.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

A(r)=∑nαn,0exp[ςn(r2−r02)]+ζEquation 1 Here A(r) is the absorbance at radial position r, the summation is over all species n; αn0 is the absorbance of the nth species at the reference position r0, ςn = Mn(1 −v̄ρ)ω2/RT with Mn the molecular weight of the nth species, v̄ its partial specific volume (0.737 for CAP, 0.732 for repressor), ρ the solution density, ω the rotor angular velocity, R the gas constant and T the absolute temperature. The baseline offset term ζ compensates for slight position-independent differences in the optical properties of different cell assemblies. Absorbance scale equilibrium quotients (K′) were evaluated by fitting datasets using Eq. 1 with αC2R= K′α C2αR. Concentration scale values were calculated usingKobs = 1.44K′(ε C2αR/(2εC+ εR), where εC and εR are the molar extinction coefficients of CAP and repressor, respectively, and the value 1.44 is the square of the optical path length of the centrifuge cell. Representative sedimentation profiles of lac repressor and CAP, obtained at 4 °C and 18,000 rpm, are shown in Fig.2 A. The solid curves through the data are global least-squares fits of the expression for a single species (Equation 1 with n corresponding to lacrepressor or CAP, as appropriate) to six data sets (2 concentrations, 3 rotor speeds) for each protein, obtained using the program NONLIN (34Johnson M. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The small, symmetrically distributed residuals demonstrate the compatibility of the single-species model with the data. The molecular weights returned by these analyses were 48,580 ± 1,760 for CAP and 153,498 ± 6,950 for lac repressor. The agreement with the molecular weights derived from sequence (Mr (CAP dimer) = 47,238;Mr (lac repressor tetramer) = 154,520) indicates that neither protein is significantly degraded nor aggregated, under our experimental conditions. Solutions containing both CAP and lac repressor contained additional species that gave weight-average molecular weights significantly greater than those expected for noninteracting proteins. Shown in Fig. 2 B is data acquired with such a mixture. The smooth curve represents the fit of Equation 1 (with terms for free CAP, free repressor, and a CAP-repressor complex) to the data. In this fit,Mr values of CAP and repressor were fixed but that of the third species was allowed to float, returning a value of 240,820 ± 14,140. This is within error equal to the value (248,996) expected for a 2:1 CAP/repressor complex. The small residuals attest to the compatibility of this model with the data, although the upward deviation of residuals at the bottom of the cell suggests that higher molecular weight species can form at very high [protein]. This result is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a direct interaction of CAP with lac repressor, in the absence of DNA. Other models for the complex were tested, including a 1:1 CAP/repressor complex, a 3:1 CAP/repressor complex, self-association of CAP (with no repressor binding), and self-association of lac repressor (with no CAP binding). All of these models fit the data significantly less well than the 2:1 CAP/repressor model, and all gave larger residuals with nonrandom distributions (results not shown). In addition, a model with terms for free CAP, free lacrepressor, a 1:1 complex, and a 2:1 complex fit the data as well as the 3 species model, but returned values of the concentration term for the 1:1 complex (α1:1,0) that were within error equal to zero. Whereas this does not rule out the presence of a 1:1 complex in these reaction mixtures, it indicates that it does not accumulate to significant levels. The continuous variation (Job) method (13Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) was used to further test the 2:1 complex model (Fig. 2 C). Eight samples prepared with total protein fixed ([CAP] + [lac repressor] = 3.4 × 10−6m), but ranging in mole-fraction of CAP from 0.2 to 0.9, gave values ofMr (complex) compatible with a 2:1 molar ratio (mean ± S.D. = 243,600 ± 8,150; Fig. 2 C,upper panel). In addition, the amount of complex observed depended on the mole-fraction of CAP, giving a maximum near X(CAP) = 0.7 (equivalent to a molar ratio of 2.3 CAP/repressor). These results confirm that the dominant complex has a 2:1 stoichiometry, and the preferential formation of 2:1 complex and the absence of detectable 1:1 complex at low CAP/repressor ratios strongly suggests that the binding of CAP to lac repressor is cooperative. A general mechanism for CAP-repressor binding in the presence of cAMP is shown in Reaction 1, n cAMP+2CAP+lac repressor↔K(CAP2·cAMPn)·lac repressor REACTION1for which K = [(CAP2·cAMPn)·lacrepressor]/[cAMP]n [CAP]2 [lacrepressor] and the observable macromolecular equilibrium quotient Kobs = [(CAP2·cAMPn)·lacrepressor]/[CAP]2 [lac repressor]. The cAMP stoichiometry 3For the reaction shown in Equation 2, net cAMP uptake will yield n > 0, net release, n < 0, and a cAMP-independent reaction, n = 0. can be evaluated from Equation 2 (14Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990: 63-121Google Scholar). ∂logKobs∂log[cAMP]=nEquation 2 A graph of log Kobs as a function of log [cAMP] is shown in Fig. 3. The slope (1.8 ± 0.3) indicates that 2 equivalents of cAMP arebound for each CAP2·repressor complex formed. Although these data do not specify the distribution of cAMP within the complex, in the absence of repressor, native CAP dimers bind one equivalent of cAMP over the concentration range 0 < [cAMP] = 20 μm spanned in this experiment (15Takahashi T. Blazy B. Baudras A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that each molecule of CAP in the CAP2·repressor complex binds one molecule of cAMP. It is striking that the increased affinity of CAP for lac repressor with increasing [cAMP] parallels that of CAP for DNA, observed over the same [cAMP] range (7Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, conditions that promote transcription-regulatory CAP-DNA interactions in vivo may also promote CAP-repressor interactions. A parallel analysis was carried out with the lacI-18 mutant lacrepressor. This protein lacks 18 C-terminal residues that mediate tetramer formation in the wild-type protein (17Chen J. Matthews K.S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The result is a dimeric repressor protein that binds one equivalent of DNA but cannot bridge between two DNA segments in the fashion observed with wild-type repressor (19O'Gorman R.B. Dunaway M.

Shown in Fig. 4 are sedimentation data for the lacI-18 repressor alone and for a representative sample containing lacI-18 repressor and CAP. The data for repressor alone are well fit by a single-species model, with a weight-average molecular weight of 74,280 ± 3,780, in close agreement with that predicted for the dimer (Mr= 77,260). However, inclusion of CAP in the solution does not result in a detectable concentration of complex. The data are consistent with a two-species model, which returns Mr values of 50,030 ± 3,740 for CAP and 76,140 ± 4,350 for repressor, in good agreement with their individual molecular weights. Models with terms for CAP, lacI-18 repressor, and a CAP-repressor complex fit the data as well as the two-species model, but returned values of the concentration term for the complex (αCR,0) that were indistinguishable from zero. Although these results do not rule out complex formation, they indicate that none accumulated to a level sufficient for detection. Because our preparations of lacI-18 repressor appeared homogeneous and of correct molecular weight by SDS-PAGE and sedimentation equilibrium criteria and were active in DNA binding (5Vossen K.M. Stickle D.F. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,8Stickle D.F. Liu G. Fried M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that their inability to bind CAP is a consequence of either proteolytic degradation or gross misfolding of the protein. We therefore hypothesize that the difference in CAP-binding activity of dimeric and tetrameric repressors is a functional difference of the native proteins. The repressor tetramer structure (Fig.5) reveals two features not present in the dimer that we propose as candidates for CAP-interaction sites. These are the C-terminal structures that organize repressor as a dimer of dimers (and which are disrupted by the lacI-18 mutation), and the cleft between adjacent dimeric repressor assemblies. The approximate 2-fold symmetry of the tetramer implies that two copies of these structures are available to bind two equivalents of CAP, as was observed. Also shown in Fig. 5 is a schematic model of a CAP-repressor complex in which two molecules of CAP are depicted interacting with the cleft between adjacent dimeric repressor assemblies. Current models of lac promoter regulation (see Refs. 23Reznikoff W.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2419-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Reznikoff W.S. J.

Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1996Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) focus on the independent functions of CAP and lac repressor at their primary binding sites (CAP site 1 and operator 1). These models reflect the absence of clear evidence for regulatory cross-talk between CAP and repressor in the extensive literature dedicated to this system. One might well ask why such cross-talk is not seen, given the overlap of binding sites in the lac promoter region (Fig.1), and the in vitro data indicating that CAP interacts with lac repressor (described above). The results presented in this paper may be a step toward the answer to that question. As a working hypothesis, we propose that formation of energetically favorable CAP-repressor contacts may compensate for the loss of preferred CAP-DNA contacts when CAP is displaced from operator 1 by lac repressor. These interactions could reduce the CAP potential to interfere with the regulatory repressor-operator 1 interaction. By the same token, favorable CAP-repressor interaction may reduce the overall energetic cost of the isomerization of the repressor-operator 3 complex that occurs when CAP binds CAP site 1 (6Fried M.G. Hudson J.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1930-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These interactions could reduce repressor's potential to interfere with the regulatory interaction of CAP with CAP site 1. These considerations predict new classes of CAP and lac repressor mutations that should allow testing of this hypothesis in vivo. Such mutations would disrupt the protein-protein interaction but not the corresponding DNA binding activities. Analogous mutations affecting CAP-RNA polymerase- and CAP-CytR repressor-interactions have been identified (25Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Sogaard-Andersen L. Mironov A.S. Pedersen H. Sukhodelets V.V. Valentin-Hansen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4921-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is correct, destabilization of the CAP-repressor complex should result in lac promoter repression that depends on the absence of cAMP and CAP, and transcription activation by CAP + cAMP that depends on the absence of lac repressor. Finally, this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a direct interaction of CAP with lac repressor, in the absence of DNA. Little is known about the location or functions of these proteins when they are not bound to their regulatory DNA sequences. The results presented here raise the possibility that CAP and lacrepressor may be associated when not performing their transcription-regulatory functions. We thank Dr. Kathleen S. Matthews for providing the wild-type and mutant lac repressor proteins used in this study."

In Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with m2 muscarinic receptor, muscarinic K+ channel, receptor kinase (GRK2), and β-arrestin 2, desensitization of iK,AChduring a 3-min application of 10 μm ACh was significantly increased as compared with that in cells transfected with receptor, channel, and GRK2 only (fade in current increased from 45 to 78%). The effect of β-arrestin 2 was lost if cells were not co-transfected with GRK2. Resensitization (recovery from desensitization) of iK,ACh in cells transfected with β-arrestin 2 was significantly slowed (time constant increased from 34 to 232 s). Activation and deactivation of iK,ACh on application and wash-off of ACh in cells transfected with β-arrestin 2 were significantly slowed from 0.9 to 3.1 s (time to half peak iK,ACh) and from 6.2 to 13.8 s (time to half-deactivation), respectively. In cells transfected with a constitutively active β-arrestin 2 mutant, desensitization occurred in the absence of agonist (peak current significantly decreased from 0.4 ± 0.05 to 0.1 ± 0.01 nA).

In rat atrial cells and in a mammalian cell line (transfected with m2 muscarinic receptor, muscarinic K+ channel, and receptor kinase) we have previously obtained evidence that the phosphorylation of the receptor by receptor kinase is responsible for short-term desensitization of iK,ACh (12Shui Z.

ACh, cardiac muscarinic K+ current Chinese hamster ovary guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)- triphosphate acetylcholine Arrestins act in concert with receptor kinase to bring about desensitization. Receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor promotes the binding of an arrestin to the agonist bound receptor and this causes desensitization by (i) preventing receptor-G protein interaction and (ii) for the nonvisual arrestins (β-arrestin, β-arrestin 2) only, promoting internalization of the receptor via clathrin-coated pits (the nonvisual arrestins act as adaptor proteins and bind both the receptor and clathrin) (5Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). For the m2 muscarinic receptor specifically, there is some evidence that arrestins are involved in desensitization: β-arrestin and β-arrestin 2 bind to the m2 muscarinic receptor in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (14Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). There is evidence that β-arrestin and β-arrestin 2 may be involved in m2 muscarinic receptor uncoupling: deletion of a cluster of serine/threonine residues (phosphorylation sites) in the C-terminal part of the third intracellular loop of the m2 muscarinic receptor greatly reduced the binding of arrestins and in HEK293 cells abolished desensitization as a result of receptor-G protein uncoupling (measured as a reduction in the carbachol inhibition of a isoproterenol-stimulated increase in cAMP as a result of pretreatment with carbachol) (14Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

The evidence that β-arrestin and β-arrestin 2 may also be involved in m2 muscarinic receptorinternalization is less clear: Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (14Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of β-arrestin and β-arrestin 2 in HEK-tsA201 cells resulted in an internalization of the m2 muscarinic receptor via a dynamin-dependent mechanism (arrestin-mediated internalization is known to occur via a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent mechanism). However, in the same study Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (14Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showed that internalization of the m2 muscarinic receptor in HEK-tsA201 cells in the absence of arrestin overexpression occurred via an unknown pathway that does not involve arrestins or dynamin. Furthermore, in rat ventricular cells, Feron et al. (16Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) reported evidence that the m2 muscarinic receptor is internalized via caveolae (clathrin-independent pathway), although we have observed co-localization of the m2 muscarinic receptor and clathrin after CCh pretreatment in the same cell type (17Boyett M.R. Shui Z. Khan I. Dobrzynski H. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 23Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to study the possible role of arrestin in short-term desensitization of iK,ACh. β-Arrestin 2 was chosen for study (both β-arrestin and β-arrestin 2 are ubiquitously expressed in tissues (18Krupnik J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharamacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar)). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were cultured and transiently transfected as described previously (13Shui Z. Khan I.A. Tsuga H. Haga T. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2 (all media and chemicals from Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, United Kingdom). In all experiments, cells from one of two cell lines were transiently transfected with plasmid vectors for Kir3.1 (pEF-GIRK1) and Kir3.4 (pEF-CIR) to form the muscarinic K+ channel heteromultimer using the calcium phosphate method (13Shui Z. Khan I.A. Tsuga H. Haga T. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One cell line was already stably transfected with plasmid vector for human m2 muscarinic receptor (pEF-Myc-hm2) and the second cell line was already stably transfected with plasmid vectors for human m2 muscarinic receptor (pEF-Myc-hm2) and the G protein-coupled receptor kinase, GRK2, (pEF-GRK2). GRK2 is known to be present in the heart (19Lohse M.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and it phosphorylates the m2 muscarinic receptor both in vitro and in vivo (20Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kontani K. Katada T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7753-7758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines will be referred to as clones 1 and 2, respectively. To test whether the use of a particular clone influenced the results obtained, experiments were repeated using both clones. The results obtained with the two clones were indistinguishable and they have been combined, although the clones used are identified in figure legends. Depending on the experiment, cells of clone 1 were transiently co-transfected with neither, either, or both GRK2 and wild-type β-arrestin 2 (pCMV5-β-arrestin 2). Depending on the experiment, cells of clone 2 were transiently co-transfected with neither or either wild-type β-arrestin 2 or constitutively active mutant β-arrestin 2 (pCDNA3-β-arrestin CAM). Finally, all cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmid vector for the S65T point mutation of green fluorescent protein (pGFP-S65T; CLONTECH) as a marker for successfully transfected cells. The final concentrations of each of the plasmid vectors added during transient transfections were as follows (in ng/ml): Kir3.1, 400; Kir3.4, 400; GRK2, 400; β-arrestin 2, 400; green fluorescent protein, 200. 10 ml of the transfecting solution was added to ∼1–2 × 106cells in a 100-mm diameter plastic tissue culture dish. The expression levels of the receptor and GRK2 in the stably transfected cells were measured and are given in Shui et al. (13Shui Z. Khan I.A. Tsuga H. Haga T. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A few hours before electrophysiological experiments, 0.02% EDTA solution was used to remove the adherent cell layer from the dish. The cells were then centrifuged for 3 min at 100 × g and resuspended in fresh medium on fragments of glass coverslip. Adult rats were killed by stunning and cervical dislocation. Atrial cells were prepared as described previously (22Harrison S.M. McCall E. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1992; 449: 517-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CHO cells were placed in a recording chamber mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope. 470–490-nm light was used to excite the green fluorescent protein in successfully transfected cells. The green fluorescent light was passed through a 515-nm filter for observation. Cells with a middle level of green fluorescence were chosen for study. Experiments were carried out in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique at room temperature (22–25 °C). Extracellular solution contained (in mm): KCl, 140; MgCl2, 1.8; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 5; pH 7.4. 10 μm ACh was added to the extracellular solution when required. Pipette solution contained (in mm): potassium aspartate, 120; KCl, 20; KH2PO4, 1; MgCl2, 2.8 (free Mg2+, 1.8); EGTA, 5; HEPES, 5; Na3GTP, 0.1; Na2ATP, 3; pH 7.4. Whole cell currents were recorded with an Axopatch-1D amplifier and acquired with pClamp software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter and sampled every 1 ms. Decline in currents was fitted with a single exponential function with a least squares method using SigmaPlot (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA). Statistical tests (one way analysis of variance) were carried out using SigmaStat (Jandel Corp.). In the present study, as in our previous study (13Shui Z. Khan I.A. Tsuga H. Haga T. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we have recorded iK,ACh in CHO cells transfected with the m2 muscarinic receptor and the muscarinic K+ channel (as well as other proteins). In the previous study, the cell-attached and inside-out configurations of the patch clamp technique were used and the basic properties of the channel (single channel conductance, current-voltage relationship, single channel open time, dependence on receptor and agonist) were the same as those of the muscarinic K+ channel in heart cells (13Shui Z. Khan I.A. Tsuga H. Haga T. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used; 10 μm ACh was applied using a rapid solution changer for 3 min to activate iK,ACh maximally and current was recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV in a bathing solution containing 140 mm K+. Fig. 1,A and C, shows examples of iK,AChrecorded from CHO cells during an application of ACh. Mean traces from ≥8 cells are shown. In both cases, iK,ACh was activated and deactivated on application and wash-off of ACh, respectively. During the 3-min application of ACh, there was a fade of iK,ACh as a result of short-term desensitization. In the present study, iK,ACh was recorded from rat atrial cells under conditions identical to those used for the recording of iK,ACh from CHO cells in order that the muscarinic K+ channel system reconstructed in CHO cells can be compared with the native system in heart. Fig. 6 A shows a typical recording of iK,ACh in a rat atrial cell. iK,ACh in CHO cells was qualitatively similar to that in rat atrial cells. However, there were differences. The semi-logarithmic plots in Fig. 1, B and D, show that the fade of iK,ACh in CHO cells as a result of desensitization was monoexponential, whereas it can be seen from Fig. 6 A that in rat atrial cells it is biexponential. It is known that in heart cells, short-term desensitization is comprised of two independent phases: a fast phase that develops over ∼20 s and a slower phase that develops over several minutes (23Zang W.-J., Yu, X.-J. Honjo H. Kirby M.S. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1993; 464: 649-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both of these phases are evident in Fig.6 A. It has been shown that the fast phase is the result of a change in the channel, whereas the slower phase is the result of a change in the receptor (23Zang W.-J., Yu, X.-J. Honjo H. Kirby M.S. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1993; 464: 649-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Shui Z. Boyett M.R. Zang W.-J. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fast phase of desensitization may involve a dephosphorylation of the muscarinic K+ channel (23Zang W.-J., Yu, X.-J. Honjo H. Kirby M.S. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1993; 464: 649-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Shui Z. Boyett M.R. Zang W.-J. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Kim D. Circ.

Physiol. 1996; 270: H526-H537PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may be caused by the nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis cycle of the G protein (28Chuang H.H., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11727-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based on the time course of desensitization (Fig. 1), the fast phase of desensitization observed in heart cells is absent in CHO cells (perhaps the underlying cellular machinery is absent) and the desensitization of iK, ACh in CHO cells is equivalent to the slower phase in heart cells.Figure 6Resensitization of iK,ACh in rat atrial cells.

The data are fitted with single exponential functions with time constants of 64 s (peak amplitude) and 75 s (amplitude of current after the fast phase of desensitization).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1, A and C, shows iK,ACh in CHO cells transfected with (in addition to the receptor and channel) GRK2 alone (Fig. 1 A) or GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 (Fig.1 C). As compared with cells transfected with GRK2 alone (Fig. 1 A), in cells transfected with GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 1 C), activation and deactivation of iK,AChwas slowed (see below), the peak amplitude of iK,ACh was not significantly different (p = 0.8) and the fade of iK,ACh as a result of desensitization was greater. The amplitude of desensitization (see Fig. 1 legend for measurement) in four groups of CHO cells is shown in Fig. 1 E: (i) CHO cells not transfected with either GRK2 or β-arrestin 2, (ii) CHO cells transfected with β-arrestin 2, (iii) CHO cells transfected with GRK2, and (iv) CHO cells transfected with GRK2 and β-arrestin 2. Desensitization was least in cells not transfected with either GRK2 or β-arrestin 2. Desensitization was significantly greater in cells transfected with GRK2 alone (p < 0.05), but not with β-arrestin 2 alone (p = 0.3). Desensitization was greatest in CHO cells transfected with both GRK2 and β-arrestin 2, in this cell group desensitization was significantly greater than that in other cell groups (p < 0.05 in each case). In summary, the results show that desensitization was increased by transfection with GRK2 and β-arrestin 2, but not with β-arrestin 2 alone. For comparison, Fig.1 E also shows the amplitude of the equivalent phase of desensitization in rat atrial cells (see Fig. 1 legend for measurement). The semi-logarithmic plots in Fig. 1, B and D, show that in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone (Fig. 1 B) and GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 1 D) the fade of iK,ACh as a result of desensitization occurred with similar time constants of 69.5 and 53.7 s, respectively (based on recordings from 15 and eight cells, respectively). The time constants of desensitization were also similar for CHO cells not transfected with either GRK2 or β-arrestin 2 (54.5 s; based on recordings from nine cells) or CHO cells transfected with β-arrestin 2 alone (40.9 s; based on recordings from eight cells). The time constant of the equivalent phase of desensitization in rat atrial cells was 144.0 s (based on recordings from 10 cells). Close inspection of Fig. 1shows that activation and deactivation of iK,ACh on application and wash-off of ACh was slowed in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 as compared with activation and deactivation in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone. This is clearly shown by Figs.2 and3.Figure 3Effect of expression of β-arrestin 2 on deactivation of iK,ACh.

The time to half-peak iK,ACh in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 was significantly longer than in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone (p < 0.001), whereas the time to half-peak iK,ACh in atrial cells was not significantly different from that in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone (p = 0.08). Fig. 2 B also shows the mean time to half-peak iK,ACh in CHO cells not transfected with either GRK2 or β-arrestin 2 and in CHO cells transfected with β-arrestin 2 only, these data show that the effect of β-arrestin 2 on activation was independent of the absence or presence of overexpressed GRK2 (they also show that overexpressed GRK2 had no effect on activation). The effect of transfection of GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 on deactivation of iK,ACh in CHO cells is shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3 B shows the mean time to half-deactivation of iK,ACh on wash-off of ACh. The time to half-deactivation of iK,ACh in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 was significantly longer than in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone (p < 0.001), whereas the time to half-deactivation of iK,ACh in atrial cells was significantly shorter than in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone (p < 0.001). Fig. 3 B also shows the mean time to half-deactivation of iK,ACh in CHO cells not transfected with either GRK2 or β-arrestin 2 and in CHO cells transfected with β-arrestin 2 only, these data show that the effect of β-arrestin 2 on deactivation was independent of the absence or presence of overexpressed GRK2 (they also show that overexpressed GRK2 had no effect on deactivation). Resensitization of iK,ACh(i.e. the recovery of iK,ACh from desensitization) was studied by applying test applications of ACh at various test intervals after control applications of ACh. Fig.4 shows typical traces of iK,ACh in response to control (Fig. 4, A andC) and test (Fig. 4, B and D) applications of ACh in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone (Fig. 4,A and B) or GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 4,C and D). When the test application of ACh was applied soon after the control application, iK,ACh during the test application of ACh was smaller than the control as a result of insufficient time for recovery from the desensitization that developed during the control application of ACh. As the recovery interval between the two applications was increased, iK,ACh during the test application of ACh increased toward the control as a result of resensitization. The test intervals for full recovery of iK,ACh in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone or GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 were 3 and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 4, Band D). The time courses of iK,AChresensitization in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone (squares) or GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 (circles) are shown in Fig. 5 from three or four cells, the peak amplitude of iK,ACh in response to the test application of ACh has been normalized to the peak amplitude of iK,ACh in response to the previous control application of ACh and plotted against the recovery interval between the two applications. Fig. 5 confirms that resensitization of iK,ACh was slower in CHO cells transfected with both GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 than in CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone. The time constant of resensitization in the CHO cells transfected with GRK2 alone or GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 was 34 and 232 s, respectively.Figure 5Summary of the effect of expression of β-arrestin 2 on resensitization of iK,ACh.

The data are fitted with single exponential functions with time constants of 34 s (GRK2) and 232 s (GRK2 and β-arrestin 2). The CHO cells were also transfected with the m2 muscarinic receptor and muscarinic K+ channel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 6 shows resensitization of iK,ACh in rat atrial cells. A typical trace during a control application of ACh is shown in Fig. 6 A and superimposed traces of iK,ACh during test applications of ACh are shown in Fig. 6 B. As discussed above, in rat atrial cells, unlike in CHO cells, there are two phases of desensitization of iK,ACh during a 3-min application of ACh. The two phases can be seen in Fig. 6, A and B. Resensitization of iK,ACh will be influenced by both the fast and slower phases, whereas in this study we are concerned with the slower phase only. For this reason, resensitization of iK,ACh was calculated in two ways: (i) peak iK,ACh during the test application of ACh was expressed as a percentage of peak iK,ACh during the previous control application of ACh and plotted against the recovery interval between the two applications; (ii) the amplitude of iK,ACh after the fast phase of desensitization (20 s after the start of the ACh application) was expressed as a percentage of the corresponding measurement from the previous control application of ACh and once again plotted against the recovery interval between the two applications. The time course of iK,ACh resensitization in rat atrial cells as determined by the two methods is shown in Fig. 6 C and is roughly similar. The time constant of resensitization of iK,ACh in rat atrial cells was 64 and 75 s for methods i and ii, respectively. This is intermediate between the time constants of resensitization of iK,ACh in CHO cells with and without β-arrestin 2 (Fig.5). Arrestins preferentially bind to"

Using a quantitative ELISA assay to monitor the disappearance of substrate, we have been able to follow the course of reaction between stromelysin, a metalloprotease, and its substrate phage. We found that under the proteolytic conditions where the enzyme was present in nanomolar concentration or higher, in excess over the substrate, the proteolysis of substrate phage was a single exponential event and the observed rate linear with respect to enzyme concentration. The enzyme concentration dependence could be described by pseudo first-order kinetic equations. Our data suggest that substrate binding is slow relative to the subsequent hydrolysis step, implying that the phage display selection process enriches clones that have high binding affinity to the protease, and the selection may not discriminate those of different chemical reactivity toward the enzyme. Considering that multiple substrate molecules may be present on a single phage particle, we regard the substrate phage reaction kinetic model as empirical. The validity of the model was ascertained when we successfully applied it to determine the binding affinity of a competitive inhibitor of stromelysin.

Traditionally, the sequence of a peptide substrate for protease is deduced from the natural cleavage sites of the in vivo polypeptide substrates if known. There is usually conservation of amino acid residues at the site of cleavage and in the flanking sequences. However, it has been shown that the cleavage sequences from the natural substrates are not always optimal for the enzymes when the enzymatic activities are studied in vitrowith synthetic peptides (16Coombs G.S.

The insertion of randomized sequences into protein pIII (product of gene III) of filamentous phage is the most common approach for making phage display libraries. There are up to five copies of pIII present on the surface of the phage when gene III is expressed (20Webster R.E. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). Two strategies, monovalent and multivalent display, have been reported for protease substrate phage selections (13Matthews D.J. Wells J.A.

In either case, gene III is modified such that a randomized sequence is linked to the N terminus of pIII and an affinity tag, which may be a protein or peptide epitope or a histidine tag sequence, is linked N-terminal to the random sequence (13Matthews D.J.

The phage particle loses the epitope/tag if a peptide in the library serves as a substrate for and is cleaved by the protease of interest. Unreacted phage particles have the intact epitope/tag and can be trapped preferentially by affinity binding.

The procedures involve iterative rounds of selection and enrichment aiming at enriching reactive phage particles containing sequences cleavable by the protease. The sequences found in the reactive clones are then transferred from the phage context and placed within a synthetic peptide or a chimeric protein for further characterization. The assumption has been that the peptides, which were selected from the substrate phage display, would have betterkcat/Km values over those not selected (13Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However under normal selection conditions, the enzymes are present at nanomolar concentrations or higher whereas the phage particles at ≤1012 particles/ml, which is equivalent to 1.66 pm, or 8.3 pm if taken into account that up to five copies of pIII may be expressed on the surface of a given phage particle (20Webster R.E. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). In any case, the enzyme is in excess over the substrate, indicating a single-turnover reaction to which it is invalid to apply the equations for steady-state kinetics. Phage is an unusual substrate for enzymes in that the phage particles present multiple copies of the substrate (the recombinant pIII) at one tip of a long cylinder (20Webster R.E. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar), creating microscopic heterogeneity. It is therefore not clear whether the conventional single-turnover kinetic considerations would still apply to the reaction of substrate phage. However, a good understanding of the reaction kinetics is fundamentally important and necessary for rational experimental designs. The present study sets out to define the kinetic properties of the reaction between protease and substrate phage. Using the metalloprotease stromelysin as a model, we examine in detail the kinetics of the reaction between the enzyme and the isolated substrate phage clones. We put forth a kinetic model and further validate it using a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Our kinetic model will provide more rational considerations to future phage display experimental designs, which up to now have been highly empirical. Streptavidin and bovine serum albumin (BSA)1 were purchased from Sigma and ECL blotting detection reagent and HRP/anti-M13 monoclonal conjugate from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). The biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibody 179 (mAB179) was prepared in house. The phage clones were maintained and amplified inEscherichia coli K91 cells (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recombinant stromelysin was prepared as reported previously (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and its concentration was calculated based on the total protein concentration of the protein preparation. ELISA wash solution was 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and phage assay stop solution 0.1% BSA and 5 mm EDTA in PBS. Typically the E. coli cells harboring the phage were cultured in 1-liter quantities, overnight at 37 °C. The phage particles were precipitated from the supernatant following a general procedure described previously (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phage preparations from 1-liter cultures were typically reduced to a volume of 1 ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 75 mm NaCl and then titered. Plates used for ELISA assays were Microlite 2, white 96-well flatbottom plates from Dynex Technologies (Chantilly, VA). They were first coated with Streptavidin at 10 μg/ml in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4 using 200 μl/well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The next coating was done with biotinylated mAB179 at 2 μg/ml, 200 μl/well in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, a solution of 1% BSA and 10% sucrose in PBS was added at 250 μl/well, and the plates incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed five times with ELISA wash solution between each coating. After the last coating, plates were aspirated and allowed to air dry. For each ELISA assay, 200 μl of phage-containing samples were added per well, and the plate was put on a titer plate shaker at room temperature for 1 h, after which the plates were washed five times with the wash solution. HRP/anti-M13 monoclonal conjugate, diluted 40,000 times in 0.1% BSA in PBS at 200 μl/well, was added, and the plates were put on the plate shaker for 30 min at room temperature. The dilution of the HRP/Anti-M13 was optimized for each lot. Again, the plates were washed five times in wash solution. Finally, ECL blotting detection reagent was added at 200 μl/well (no incubation) and the chemiluminescence was read in Packard Topcount (Packard Instrument, Meriden, CT) in single photon count mode at 0.02 min/well. The plate coating and the ELISA procedures were also automated. Upon completion of the transfer of the digest reaction to the ELISA plates by the Tecan (see below), a Sagian robotic arm transferred the plates to a Scitec Heidolph Titramax 100 plate shaker for the time indicated above. The Sagian robotic arm would then transfer the plates to an SLT 96 plate washer. All other reagents used for the ELISA were dispensed by Cavro syringe pumps attached to eight-pronged manifolds. The robotic arm then transferred the plates to a dedicated Packard Topcount adjacent to the robotic table. All robotics were controlled by a Pentium PC. The standard curves of each preparation were determined by serial diluting the phage in phage assay stop solution and running the ELISA without protease. The starting concentration for phage in the protease digest was determined from the standard curve by choosing the concentration coinciding with the uppermost part of the “useful range” (see Fig. 2). 200 μl of the stopped digest reaction (see below) were used in the ELISA assay. As a zero time, we included a tube of only phage and no enzyme. Every ELISA plate included a standard curve of phage and zero time points for quantification of every time point. Phage digests for stromelysin were typically done in 150-μl reaction volumes of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij 35 containing stromelysin at concentrations between 5 nm and 1.2 μm. The reaction tubes containing the lower concentrations of stromelysin were put on a slower time course, and the tubes containing higher concentrations were put on a faster time course to sample enough points for the steepest part of the decay curve (see Fig. 3). The digest reaction was initiated by adding substrate phage at a concentration ten times higher than that determined above so that upon stopping the digest by dilution, the signal intensity would lie on the uppermost part of the useful portion of the standard curve (see Fig. 2). 15-μl time points were removed from the digest reaction and diluted 20 times in stopping solution to inactivate stromelysin. 200 μl of this solution were then removed and subjected to the quantitative phage ELISA assay to determine the concentration of the remaining substrate phage. For each stopped reaction, the ELISA assay was performed in triplicate and the averaged results graphed. The enzyme concentration-dependent phage digest experiments were performed over a course of several days, and data collected on different days were reported on the same graph. When stromelysin inhibitor studies were performed, an enzyme concentration was chosen that would produce a well-defined digest curve reaching 100% digested within 20 min. Various concentrations of inhibitor were added to the reaction tubes and allowed to incubate with stromelysin for ∼5 min before initiating the digest with a concentrated stock of phage. All linear and nonlinear regression analyses were performed using KaleidaGraph 3.09 by Synergy Software (Reading, PA). Eventually, all of the above steps were programmed and performed with a robotic system from Scitec Inc. (Ashland, MA). The 1.2-ml digest tubes were held in a heating block that was kept at 25 °C by a circulating water bath. A Tecan liquid handler removed time points from the digest reactions and transferred them to a deep-well plate containing the stop solution. Sample was mixed three times and then waited until the next time point. When all the time points were completed, the Tecan transferred the stopped digest reaction from the deep-well plates into the ELISA plates. At this point, the ELISA assays were run either manually or robotically. Fig.1 shows the substrate phage clones used in the present study. The presence of the mAB179 epitope allowed the phage particles to be captured in wells of a microtiter plate that had been precoated with streptavidin followed by biotinylated mAB179. The captured phage was then detected using HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody and a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate. When the activity of HRP was developed, the chemiluminescence signals showed a sigmoidal function with respect to phage titer on a logarithmic scale (Fig.2 A). The signals were highly specific to the phage clones containing the mAB179 epitope. The parental phage clone (fdTET) containing the wild-type pIII at 1010 cfu/ml did not cross-react at all (Fig.2 A). The change of the chemiluminescence signal was most sensitive to the change in the phage concentration on the steepest portion of the curve. This part of the curve thus served as a standard curve against which a sample of unknown phage titer could be quantified (Fig. 2 B). All phage clones investigated in the present study were identical except in the protease substrate sequence (Fig. 1). We found that each clone showed noticeable but only slight variations in the shape of the standard curve when a complete titration curve was constructed for each of the clones (results not shown). To maintain the accuracy, a standard curve was constructed with the same clone that was being tested, and the curve was repeated on each of the test plates to avoid plate-to-plate variation. The time course for the proteolysis of clone 10629 by stromelysin is shown in Fig. 3. 3 × 1011 cfu/ml of 10629 was incubated with stromelysin at 25 °C. A sample was removed at each time point, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 5 mm final concentration. The amount of substrate phage particles remaining in the sample was determined by the quantitative phage ELISA assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time course was best fitted to a single-exponential equation using nonlinear regression (Equation 1), [S][S]0×100=Ae−kobs*t+CEquation 1 and the rate of substrate phage disappearance (kobs) was calculated. [S]0 is the starting substrate concentration. Because the phage ELISA assay determines the total substrate concentration (both enzyme-bound and unbound, see Reactions 1 and 2), the rate for substrate phage disappearance is also the measurement of the rate for product formation. That the product formation from substrate phage follows the single exponential kinetics does not seem to be limited to stromelysin, which is a metalloprotease. We have made similar observations with serine proteases including viral and bacterial enzymes. 2N. A. Sharkov and D. Cai, unpublished results. Proteolysis reactions of substrate phage are normally performed with solutions containing ≤1012 cfu/ml phage (13Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which corresponds to an effective concentration of the recombinant pIII up to 1.66 or 8.3 pm in monovalent or multivalent display, respectively. On the other hand, the concentrations of protease used in phage display experiments are generally in nanomolar to micromolar range, which is much greater than a substrate concentration of 8.3 pm. Therefore, the reaction of the enzyme with substrate phage can be regarded as a pseudo first-order process with respect to the substrate (see Reactions 1 and 2). The general reaction scheme for protease-catalyzed substrate hydrolysis is shown in Reaction 1, E+S⇌k−1k1E·S⇌k−2k2E·P·P′bindinghydrolysis REACTION1 where P and P′ are hydrolyzed products of S, and P may be covalently linked to the enzyme in the case of serine or cysteine proteases. When [E]0 >> [S]0, the second-order reaction can be reduced to a pseudo first-order process as is shown in Reaction 2. S⇌k−1k1[E]0E·S⇌k−2k2E·P·P′ REACTION 2Our experimental data showed clearly that the product formation, reflected by substrate disappearance, was a single-exponential process (Fig. 3), which further suggests that either the substrate binding or the hydrolysis step is fast. For the pseudo first-order scheme shown in Reaction 2, the apparent single-exponential rate constant for product formation is shown in Equation 2, kobs=k1[E]0+k−1Equation 2 if the substrate hydrolysis is fast relative to the binding step; that is, there is a linear function between kobsand enzyme concentration. If the binding step is fast, the apparent rate constant for the product formation is shown in Equation 3, kobs=k21+Kd1[E]0+k−2Equation 3 where Kd1 =k−1/k1. We determined the single-exponential rate constants (kobs) for five different phage clones (Fig. 1) at concentrations of stromelysin ranging from 5–1200 nm(Fig. 4). The reactivity of the clones is widely different; however, without exception, thekobs appears linear to the enzyme concentration throughout the range. Our data clearly agree with Equation 2, suggesting that the slopes of the linear plots should reflectk1, the second-order rate constant for substrate binding to enzyme. Recombinant proteins displayed on the tip of bacteriophage particles are not ordinary substrates for enzymes. Phage particles are long cylinders of about 7 nm in diameter and 1–2 μm in length, and each can have five copies of protein pIII (20Webster R.E. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). Because pIII is present only on one end of the cylinder, there is microscopic heterogeneity in substrate distribution. Interestingly, our data (Figs. 3 and 4) apparently agree with the conventional single-turnover kinetic equations and indicate nothing out of the ordinary on the macroscopic level for the enzymatic reactions involving substrates displayed in multivalencies. We thus conclude that the reaction between an enzyme and its substrate phage obeys the rules of pseudo first-order kinetics. However, we propose that the pseudo first-order kinetic model for substrate phage be regarded as empirical, considering that differences do exist microscopically between homogeneous substrate entities (such as synthetic peptides or purified recombinant proteins) and the recombinant protein substrate generated through phage display. We further tested the pseudo first-order kinetic model with clone 10519 by using it to investigate the binding affinity of a competitive inhibitor of stromelysin. A diketopiperazine inhibitor was isolated from a combinatorial synthetic compound library and found to have an IC50 of 9.6 μm against stromelysin. 3L. Shi, D. Harris, M. Navre, D. Tien, A. K. Szardenings, and D. A. Campbell, unpublished results. The IC50 value was determined using a thiopeptide substrate whose concentration was estimated to be below the Kmof the substrate. For a competitive inhibitor, the IC50value is always higher than the Ki value. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the reaction scheme illustrated in Reaction 1 becomes the pathway delineated in Reaction 3. E+S⇄k1k−1E⋅S⇌k2Ek−2⋅P⋅P′Ki‖+IEIREACTION 3In the presence of excess inhibitor, the free enzyme concentration is shown by Equation 4. [E]=[E]01+[I]0KiEquation 4 Under our assay conditions, the substrate phage titer was on the order of 8 × 109 cfu/ml and the enzyme in the nanomolar range. The presence of inhibitor at 10 times the dissociation constant Ki does not change the pseudo first-order assumption. Thus, Equation 2 can be modified to account for the inhibitor as is shown in Equation 5, kobs=k1[E]01+[I]0Ki+k−1Equation 5 and the Kican be determined by varying the inhibitor concentration. We determined the kobs of the proteolysis of clone 10519 in the presence of varying amounts of the inhibitor. The results, shown in Fig. 5 A, indicate that the presence of the inhibitor resulted in a decrease in the rate of proteolysis. Fig. 5 B shows the complete plot of the kobs values as a function of inhibitor concentration and the least-squares fit by nonlinear regression to Equation 5. The fit yielded a Ki of 3.8 ± 2.6 μm, which within experimental error is in good agreement with that predicted from the IC50 value.3 We have shown that the reaction of substrate phage with enzyme is a single-turnover event and can be defined by equations of pseudo first-order kinetics. The single exponential rate of product formation reflects the apparent bimolecular binding rate between the enzyme and the substrate. Several protocols have been successfully applied to the selection of protease substrate phage through screening phage display peptide libraries. The phage particles in the library are either incubated directly with the enzyme in solution (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or pre-bound to a solid support followed by incubation with the enzyme (13Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Oboyle D.R. Pokornowski K.A. Mccann P.J. Weinheimer S.P. Virology. 1997; 236: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on our finding that the proteolysis reaction is single exponential, the selection processes should enrich phage clones that have shorter half-lives from the proteolysis. A shorter half-life results from a faster rate of substrate association with enzyme, i.e.larger kobs. If it were possible to perform steady-state kinetic experiments with substrate phage, it would imply that substrates with larger kobs would have a smaller Michaelis constant Km and a largerkcat too, if the turnover number was somewhat limited by the binding step. Because it is not feasible experimentally to achieve the conditions of steady-state kinetics with substrate phage, synthetic peptides with the sequence encompassing the entire variable region of the substrate phage have often been used to further characterize the substrates identified in phage display experiments. The second-order rate constants calculated from the linear plots in our single-turnover studies, shown in Fig. 4, are summarized in TableI along with the steady-state kinetic parameters measured previously for the corresponding synthetic peptides (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The second order rate constants vary over 100-fold for the five phage clones tested whereas thekcat/Km values differ by 30-fold for the synthetic peptide substrates. It appears thatKm, and kcat to some extent, contribute to the increase in the enzyme catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the synthetic peptides. It has been shown in several studies that synthetic peptides, derived from substrate phage clones selected under the same condition, could have very different Km andkcat values (16Coombs G.S. Bergstrom R.C. Pellequer J.L. Baker S.I. Navre M. Smith M.M. Tainer J.A. Madison E.L. Corey D.R. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 475-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Ding L.

Trivedi K. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and furthermore, there were even cases where peptide sequences derived from reactive phage clones failed to show significant reactivity when incorporated into synthetic peptide (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It can be concluded that overall there is no clear distinction as to which one of the steady-state kinetic parameters is the prevailing contributor to the improvement of catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, there may be no direct correlation between the reactivity of phage clones and synthetic peptides. This may be a consequence of the fact that phage and peptide are two unrelated substrate systems.Table IComparison of substrate phage reactivity with that of synthetic peptide substratesSubstrate phageSynthetic peptide substrate1-bThe underlined sequences indicate the amino acid sequences in the variable regions of the corresponding phage clones as shown in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab We recognize that recombinant proteins expressed on the tip of a phage particle and synthetic peptides are different molecular entities and as substrates, the substrate phage obeys single-turnover kinetics whereas the synthetic peptides are usually assayed under multiple-turnover conditions obeying steady-state kinetics. This may create difficulties in extrapolating the phage display results to the synthetic peptides. Another consideration for why it is difficult to extrapolate may lie in plausible protein-protein interactions between the enzyme and the bulk of the recombinant pIII protein outside of the substrate region. Several strategies have been employed in designing the flanking sequences for the incorporation of randomized peptides into pIII in the hope of minimizing the effect of the pIII polypeptide outside of the random region (13Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that peptides of certain sequences in the random region could still promote favorable protein-protein interactions between the enzyme and the recombinant pIII, and as a result these clones would be preferentially selected. They may behave poorly as substrate once the substrate sequence is separated from the pIII protein and made into synthetic peptides. The substrate phage selection procedures rely on capturing and removing unreacted clones from the library, in the hope of enriching reactive ones following each round of selection. That the course of reaction between enzyme and substrate phage is single-exponential (Fig. 3) is thus a key observation. It implies that strong and weak substrates are differentiated by their half-lives of proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that time of incubation and the amount of enzyme are critical factors in designing substrate phage selection experiments. Therefore, few substrates would be found if the selection conditions were too stringent; that is, if the incubation time were too short or the enzyme concentration too low. On the other hand, it would offer little discrimination among good substrates if the conditions were too relaxed. Stringent conditions are preferred if the population of potential substrates in the library is relatively large. This may apply to enzymes that can tolerate a number of amino acid sequence variations in the substrate. For instance, it has been discovered through practice that stringent conditions were key to the success of substrate phage display experiments with protein tyrosine kinases (14Dente L. Vetriani C.

In general, the selection conditions should be set close to the relaxed scenario when the reactivity of the substrate phage is unknown, and especially when the population of potential substrates in the library is small. This is particularly important for enzymes such as certain proteases that are highly specific in sequence requirements. We thank Bruce Mortenson for supplying biotinylated mAB179."
