https://openalex.org/W2100713606,"Chili peppers produce the pungent vanilloid compound capsaicin, which offers protection from predatory mammals. Birds are indifferent to the pain-producing effects of capsaicin and therefore serve as vectors for seed dispersal. Here, we determine the molecular basis for this species-specific behavioral response by identifying a domain of the rat vanilloid receptor that confers sensitivity to capsaicin to the normally insensitive chicken ortholog. Like its mammalian counterpart, the chicken receptor is activated by heat or protons, consistent with the fact that both mammals and birds detect noxious heat and experience thermal hypersensitivity. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the ecological phenomenon of directed deterence and suggest that the capacity to detect capsaicin-like inflammatory substances is a recent acquisition of mammalian vanilloid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2133503471,"How sister kinetochores attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles during mitosis (bi-orientation) remains poorly understood. In yeast, the ortholog of the Aurora B-INCENP protein kinase complex (Ipl1-Sli15) may have a role in this crucial process, because it is necessary to prevent attachment of sister kinetochores to microtubules from the same spindle pole. We investigated IPL1 function in cells that cannot replicate their chromosomes but nevertheless duplicate their spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Kinetochores detach from old SPBs and reattach to old and new SPBs with equal frequency in IPL1+ cells, but remain attached to old SPBs in ipl1 mutants. This raises the possibility that Ipl1-Sli15 facilitates bi-orientation by promoting turnover of kinetochore-SPB connections until traction of sister kinetochores toward opposite spindle poles creates tension in the surrounding chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2084117490,"E2 enzymes catalyze attachment of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins to lysine residues directly or through E3-mediated reactions. The small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO regulates nuclear transport, stress response, and signal transduction in eukaryotes and is essential for cell-cycle progression in yeast. In contrast to most ubiquitin conjugation, the SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9 is sufficient for substrate recognition and lysine modification of known SUMO targets. Crystallographic analysis of a complex between mammalian Ubc9 and a C-terminal domain of RanGAP1 at 2.5 A reveals structural determinants for recognition of consensus SUMO modification sequences found within SUMO-conjugated proteins. Structure-based mutagenesis and biochemical analysis of Ubc9 and RanGAP1 reveal distinct motifs required for substrate binding and SUMO modification of p53, IkappaBalpha, and RanGAP1."
https://openalex.org/W2082335615,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein and the Akt/PKB kinase play important roles in the transduction of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals, respectively. We provide evidence that conflicting signals transduced by Akt and p53 are integrated via negative feedback between the two pathways. On the one hand, the combination of ionizing radiation and survival factor deprivation, which leads to rapid apoptosis of IL-3 dependent DA-1 cells, entails a caspase- and p53-dependent destruction of Akt. This destruction of Akt is not a secondary consequence of apoptosis, since it is not seen when the same cells are triggered to undergo apoptosis under different conditions. On the other hand upon serum stimulation, when Akt becomes active and enhances cell survival, phosphorylation occurs at an Akt consensus site (serine 166) within the Mdm2 protein, a key regulator of p53 function. Taken together, our findings suggest that depending on the balance of signals, p53-dependent downregulation of Akt may promote an irreversible commitment to apoptotic cell death, whereas effective recruitment of Akt by appropriate survival signals may lead to activation of Mdm2, inactivation of p53, and eventually inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2007639993,"Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma. HHV-8 envelope glycoprotein B possesses the RGD motif known to interact with integrin molecules, and HHV-8 infectivity was inhibited by RGD peptides, antibodies against RGD-dependent alpha3 and beta1 integrins, and by soluble alpha3beta1 integrin. Expression of human alpha3 integrin increased the infectivity of virus for Chinese hamster ovary cells. Anti-gB antibodies immunoprecipitated the virus-alpha3 and -beta1 complexes, and virus binding studies suggest a role for alpha3beta1 in HHV-8 entry. Further, HHV-8 infection induced the integrin-mediated activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). These findings implicate a role for alpha3beta1 integrin and the associated signaling pathways in HHV-8 entry into the target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2106392233,"Over 90 different mutations in the gene encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause ∼2% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases by an unknown mechanism. We engineered 14 different human ALS-related SOD1 mutants and obtained high yields of biologically metallated proteins from an Sf21 insect cell expression system. Both the wild type and mutant “as isolated” SOD1 variants were deficient in copper and were heterogeneous by native gel electrophoresis. By contrast, although three mutant SOD1s with substitutions near the metal binding sites (H46R, G85R, and D124V) were severely deficient in both copper and zinc ions, zinc deficiency was not a consistent feature shared by the as isolated mutants. Eight mutants (A4V, L38V, G41S, G72S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133Δ) exhibited normal SOD activity over pH 5.5–10.5, per equivalent of copper, consistent with the presumption that bound copper was in the proper metal-binding site and was fully active. The H48Q variant contained a high copper content yet was 100-fold less active than the wild type enzyme and exhibited a blue shift in the visible absorbance peak of bound Cu(II), indicating rearrangement of the Cu(II) coordination geometry.

Progressive dysfunction of both upper and lower motor neurons causes death from respiratory paralysis, usually within 5 years. Investigation of the causes of familial ALS, which comprises ∼10% of cases, may contribute insights relevant to the pathophysiology of sporadic ALS and of other motor neuron diseases (1Brown Jr., R.H.

A subset of autosomal dominant ALS is caused by over 90 mutations in the gene encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) (3Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A.

SOD1 is a 32-kDa homodimeric enzyme that functions as an antioxidant, converting two molecules of superoxide anion (O2·¯) to O2 and H2O2. This redox cycle involves alternate reduction (reaction 1) and reoxidation (reaction 2) of the catalytic copper ion by O2·¯.SOD1­Cu(II)+O2·¯←SOD1­Cu(I)+O2Equation 1 SOD1­Cu(I)+O2·¯+2H+←SOD1­Cu(II)+H2O2Equation 2 REACTIONS1and2SOD1 contains an eight-stranded β-barrel motif, an intrasubunit disulfide bond, and a zinc binding site that contribute to its extreme thermochemical stability (Fig. 1). The mutant residues are scattered throughout the protein, including some residues important for copper or zinc coordination, others located near the dimer interface or at either pole of the β-barrel, and several in the charged loop near the C terminus that may guide O2·¯ to the active site. Although most are missense substitutions, some are predicted to truncate the C terminus of the protein, including the charged loop. No null mutations have been described. Mutant SOD1 most likely causes motor neuron death by gain of an unknown toxic property rather than by deficiency of dismutase activity (reviewed in Ref. 5Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Numerous studies in yeast and mammalian cultures implicate a proapoptotic function of mutant SOD1, while SOD1 knockout mice do not acquire ALS pathology (6Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Moreover, transgenic mice that overexpress ALS mutant SOD1s consistently develop severe motor neuron pathology despite increased total SOD1 activity (7Pu M.E. Gurney H. Chiu A.Y. Dal Canto M.C.

An increase or a decrease of wild type (WT) SOD1 expression does not affect the course of the disorder in G85R mutant SOD1 mice (13Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), suggesting that cellular O2·¯ levels do not directly influence mutant SOD1 toxicity. To clarify biophysical and biochemical properties that differ between mutant and normal SOD1, we engineered 14 different ALS mutant SOD1s and expressed each protein in an Sf21 insect cell/baculovirus system. The insect cell system was chosen because, like yeast but unlike bacterial systems, it produces very high expression of soluble SOD1 variants with correctly acetylated amino-terminal groups (14Fujii J. Myint T. Seo H.G. Kayanoki Y. Ikeda Y. Taniguchi N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1456-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, while previous reports of mutant SOD1s expressed in yeast have described abnormal metal ion coordination (15Lyons T.J. Liu H. Goto J.J. Nersissian A. Roe J.A. Graden J.A. Cafe C. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12240-12244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and abnormally low copper/zinc ratios (16Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30104-30109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether altered metal incorporation is a function of the expression system, the in vitro remetallation procedure, or the mutations themselves. A standard procedure for obtaining a homogeneous population of fully metallated WT SOD1 after purification involves removal of metal ions by chelation at pH 3.8 followed by remetallation with copper and zinc (17Pantoliano M.W. Valentine J.S. Burger A.R. Lippard S.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1982; 17: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have shown that, in contrast to WT SOD1, remetallated ALS mutant enzymes exhibit an altered zinc binding site and abnormal copper coordination geometry (15Lyons T.J. Liu H. Goto J.J. Nersissian A. Roe J.A. Graden J.A. Cafe C. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2000; 15: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that the removal of metals under acidic conditions in vitro from some ALS SOD1 mutants grown in yeast, followed by remetallation, may result in metal ion mislocalization to the wrong binding site (19Goto J.J. Zhu H. Sanchez R.J. Nersissian A. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is important to distinguish whether these abnormalities arise in biologically metallated mutant SOD1s or are related to irreversible denaturing influences during the remetallation procedure. We have therefore analyzed “as-isolated” SOD1 enzymes, without attempting to deplete or substitute bound metal ions. Human SOD1 mutants were expressed and purified from insect cells and then compared with the WT enzyme obtained under similar conditions. In this report, we identified differences in electrophoretic mobility, copper and zinc ion content, copper coordination geometry, and specific SOD activity of these SOD1 variants containing biologically incorporated metals. All solutions were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and were prepared using water that had been purified with a Millipore deionizing system. KCl, NaCl, (NH4)2SO4, β-mercaptoethanol, Tris base, and monobasic and dibasic potassium phosphate were from J. T. Baker Inc.; EDTA was from Invitrogen; CuCl2 and ZnCl2 were from Sigma; dithiothreitol, glycerol, and SDS were from EM Science; HNO3 and copper and zinc standards were from Fisher. Ultrapure water for preparation of the ICP-MS samples was from CASCO NERL Diagnostic. cDNA fragments encoding 14 specific human mutant SOD1s associated with familial ALS (A4V, L38V, G41S, H46R, H48Q, G72S, D76Y, G85R, D90A, G93A, D124V, D125H, E133Δ, and S134N) were constructed using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers and the megaprimer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (21Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Ling M.M. Robinson B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A 0.8-kb PstI to EcoRI cassette containing human WT SOD1 cDNA sequence was ligated into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen) and used as a template for mutagenesis. For each mutant, a megaprimer was produced by PCR using a forward primer containing vector sequence and a reverse primer containing the desired mutation within the human SOD1 cDNA. To enhance fidelity of the PCR, Taq (Fisher) and Pfu (Stratagene) polymerases were mixed in an activity ratio of 20:1. The gel-purified PCR product was added to a downstream vector primer in a second PCR to yield a full-length mutagenic cDNA. The 1.1-kb mutant PCR product was cleaved near each end with PstI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and the resulting 0.8-kb fragment was directionally cloned into pVL1392. The entire coding region of each clone was sequenced to verify the desired substitution and to rule out spurious mutations. To produce baculovirus stocks, cells fromSpodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) were grown as adherent cultures at 27 °C in Grace’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, trace metals, lactalbumin hydrolysate, yeastolate, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Baculovirus DNA (0.1 ng of BaculoGold; Pharmingen) was co-transfected with pVL1392 (containing WT or mutant SOD1 sequence) into Sf21 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation and incubated for 5 days. Recombinant viruses in the supernatant were amplified by two or three rounds of infection to obtain a high titer viral stock of 5–10 × 107 pfu/ml, as estimated by the end point dilution method. For moderate scale protein expression, suspension cultures of Sf21 insect cells were propagated in 0.5–1-liter spinner flasks (Bellco) at 27 °C in serum-free medium (SFM II-900; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. The impellor was rotated at 95 rpm, and cultures in log phase growth at a density of 1.0–1.5 × 106 cells/ml were inoculated with baculovirus stock at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. During inoculation, either 50, 150, or 300 μm of CuCl2 and ZnCl2 was added to the medium from separate 150 mm stocks (pH 7.4). Metal ion concentrations greater than 500 μm in the serum-free medium were excessively toxic to Sf21 cells. During the expression period, cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. At 48–60 h following infection, the cell pellet was harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and then stored at −80 °C. We employed hydrophobic interaction chromatography to isolate highly pure SOD1 rapidly from Sf21 cells. The cell pellet from 2 liters of culture was resuspended on ice in 100 ml of a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (“Complete, EDTA-free”; catalog no. 1873580; Roche Diagnostics). The cells were thoroughly disrupted after six cycles of homogenization using a Beadbeater (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK) and 1-mm glass beads for 30 s followed by cooling on ice for 30 s. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. (NH4)2SO4 crystals were added over 10 min to the supernatant to ∼53% saturation (31.4 g/100 ml) with gentle stirring on ice, and the centrifugation was repeated. 0.25 volumes of a saturated (NH4)2SO4 solution prepared at 25 °C was added to adjust the supernatant to ∼64% saturation at 4 °C, and the centrifugation was repeated. The supernatant was diluted with 0.215 volume of water to a final concentration of 2.0m (NH4)2SO4 and loaded onto a column containing 30 ml of phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow high sub (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed extensively with a high salt buffer containing 2 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, adjusted to a final pH of 7.0 with NaOH. Proteins were eluted using a 300-ml linearly decreasing salt gradient toward a low salt buffer that was identical to the high salt buffer except for omission of (NH4)2SO4. WT or mutant SOD1 was released with high specificity from the column between 1.6 and 1.1m ammonium sulfate (240–170-millisiemens conductivity). Fractions containing SOD1 were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and exchanged to a low salt buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) using a Centricon-80 spin concentrator (Millipore Corp.). The proteins were then loaded onto a HiTrap Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a 200-ml linearly increasing salt gradient toward a high salt buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0). SOD1 proteins typically eluted between 50 and 100 mm NaCl (6–13-millisiemens conductivity) as one major peak that contained >90% of the total SOD1 protein. A minor peak (<10% of total SOD1) eluted at higher salt concentrations. Fractions containing SOD1 were pooled, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C for short term use or at −80 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed using 15% polyacrylamide gels and a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. The sample loading buffer contained 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.007% bromphenol blue. After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with a solution containing 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid or electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for Western blot analysis. Blots were incubated for 1 h each at 25 °C with a 1:2,000 dilution of a primary sheep anti-human SOD1 polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem catalog no. 574597) and a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Calbiochem catalog no. 402100; peroxidase conjugate) according to the ECL (Amersham Biosciences) protocol. For native PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, the loading buffer did not contain SDS or β-mercaptoethanol, the samples were not boiled, and the running buffer did not contain SDS. The purity and molecular weight of the isolated proteins were determined using a Finnigan LCQ electrospray ionization, quadropole ion trap mass spectrometer. Data were collected and analyzed at the Mass Spectrometry Facility (E. K. Shriver Center, Waltham, MA). SOD1 proteins (10 μg/ml) were analyzed under denaturing conditions in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The scan range was 500–2000 m/z, the average time per scan was 2.4 s, and the mass accuracy of the instrument was 0.05%. The ESI spectra were acquired using the LCQ Navigator software, and the scans were deconvoluted using the Finnigan BioWorks software. The copper and zinc ion content for each SOD1 variant after purification was quantitated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). SOD1 proteins were diluted to 1.5–4 μm in 0.1% nitric acid. The mass spectrometer was programmed to detect Cu-65 and Zn-68, and standard curves were constructed from solutions of known copper and zinc content. Protein concentrations were based on absorbance at 280 nm of the purified enzymes, as described under “Spectroscopy.” Measurements were made in duplicate or triplicate with an experimental error of <5% using the ICP-MS instrument at the Caltech Environmental Analysis Center and a Perkin-Elmer Elan 5000A instrument. UV-visible spectra from 240–900 nm were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard model 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Purified proteins in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) were centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 ×g before obtaining spectra. Dimeric SOD1 concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of ɛ280 nm = 1.08 × 104m−1cm−1 (16Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30104-30109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except for the D76Y mutant, for which ɛ280 nm = 1.38 × 104m−1 cm−1 was used to account for the additional tyrosine absorbance (23Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3435) Google Scholar). For clarity in Fig. 6, artifacts produced at 486, 628, and 656 ± 2 nm by the spectrophotometer lamp were omitted. SOD activity was measured directly by pulse radiolysis as described previously (16Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30104-30109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All activity measurements were conducted in buffer containing Millipore-deionized water, 10 mm formate, 10 mm phosphate, and 10–25 μm EDTA. The pH was adjusted by the addition of NaOH or H2SO4 (both of highest purity commercially available). By monitoring the change in absorbance at 260 nm with respect to time, a first-order rate for the catalytic disproportionation of O2·¯ was obtained. To calculate specific activities based on the amount of catalytic copper present, the observed rates were divided by the total copper concentration per subunit (16Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30104-30109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In most of the solutions assayed, the copper concentrations were between 0.4 and 1.2 μm, except for D125H (0.09 μm) and A4V (0.125 μm). We produced a diverse set of 14 human SOD1 variants for biophysical and biochemical analysis (Fig. 1). A brief summary of the structural aspects of these highly conserved residues is presented here to facilitate the description of our experimental findings. Five mutants within the β-barrel (A4V, L38V, G41S, D90A, and G93A) were constructed (Fig. 1A). A4V SOD1, which causes an aggressive motor neuron degeneration with median survival of 11 months (24Cudkowicz M.E. McKenna-Yasek D. Sapp P.E. Chin W. Geller B. Hayden D.L. Schoenfeld D.A. Hosler B.A. Horvitz H.R. Brown R.H. Ann.

Science. 1993; 261: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). L38V, G41S, D90A, and G93A were chosen because they are located within important turns near one pole of the β-barrel. L38V may disrupt packing of the β-barrel “plug,” while loss of left-handed glycines in G41S and G93A may reduce the flexibility of their respective loops. Substitution of Gly-93 with any side chain will perturb the carbonyl oxygen of Leu-38 and may disrupt the local backbone structure (26Hart P.J. Liu H. Pellegrini M. Nersissian A.M. Gralla E.B.

In addition, the Asp-90 side chain may accept a hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of residue 92 to stabilize the tight β-hairpin turn formed by residues 90–93 (26Hart P.J. Liu H. Pellegrini M. Nersissian A.M. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Six mutants located near the active site (H46R, H48Q, G72S, D76Y, G85R, and D124V) were selected because they may alter metal binding or reactivity (Fig. 1B). His-48 may normally position the copper ion in a strained coordination geometry that favors rapid redox cycling between the Cu(I) and Cu(II) forms in Reactions 1 and 2 (27Ellerby L.M. Cabelli D.E.

In addition, His-46 participates with Asp-124 and the zinc ligand His-71 to form an extended bridge between the copper and zinc ions (Fig. 1B). Non-ALS mutant substitutions of Asp-124 are known to bind zinc poorly (30Banci L. Bertini I. Cabelli D.E. Hallewell R.A. Tung J.W. Viezzoli M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The left-handed Gly-85 residue interacts through a conserved water molecule with both Asp-124 and Gly-72, which may influence both the copper and zinc binding sites. The G85R mutation was selected because it may severely destabilize this interaction, or may disrupt the local backbone structure that positions Asp-83 for zinc coordination (25Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.Y. Hu E.D. Getzoff P. Herzfeldt B. Roos R.P. Warner C. Deng G. Soriano E. Smyth C. Parge H. Ahmed A. Roses A.D. Hallewell R.A. Pericak-Vance M.A. Siddique T. Science. 1993; 261: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). G72S and D76Y, located within the zinc-binding loop, were constructed to examine the degree to which they may specifically impair zinc binding. D125H, E133Δ, and S134N were selected because they may alter the charged loop that forms one face of the channel leading to the active site. E133Δ denotes a deletion of the Glu-133 residue (31Hosler B.A. Nicholson G.A. Sapp P.C. Chin W. Orrell R.W. de Belleroche J.S. Esteban J. Hayward L.J. McKenna-Yasek D. Yeung L. Cherryson A.K.

These three residues interact with each other and with Thr-137 through the local backbone and a conserved hydrogen bond network (Fig. 1B). Perturbation of the channel geometry or its flexibility could alter the steering of O2·¯ or influence reactivity of the catalytic copper ion. Human WT or mutant SOD1 proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells using a baculoviral system and isolated using an improved SOD1 purification procedure. In Fig.2A, the soluble cellular lysate from uninfected Sf21 cells (lane 1) was compared by SDS-PAGE with corresponding lysates from cells expressing WT, G85R, or G93A SOD1s (lane 2 in each group). We estimated that human SOD1 expression in this system accounted for ∼3–12% of total soluble protein, based on relative Coomassie Blue staining of the band migrating at 18–22 kDa. This species, which was not detected in uninfected cells, was recognized by an anti-SOD1 antibody on parallel Western blots (Fig.2B). SOD1 proteins remained soluble in buffer at pH 8.0 that contained ammonium sulfate added to 64% saturation (Fig. 2A,lane 3 in each group) and were recovered efficiently using hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Under high salt conditions, SOD1 and other proteins directly adsorbed to a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The concentrated SOD1 proteins were then selectively eluted from the column by a decreasing salt gradient. The rapidity of this gentle procedure allowed us to obtain SOD1 at >80% purity within several hours of cell lysis (Fig. 2A, lane 4 in eachgroup). Pooled fractions containing SOD1 as identified by SDS-PAGE were desalted and applied to a Q Sepharose anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions from the major elution peak containing SOD1 were pooled and showed no evidence of significant contaminating proteins by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2A, lane 5 in each group) or by mass spectrometry (see below). We observed that SOD1 mutants D76Y and E133Δ each eluted from the anion exchange column during a salt gradient as two distinct peaks, centered at ∼60 and ∼85 mm NaCl. This suggested the presence of differentially charged species. Fractions composing each peak for these mutants were pooled separately and designated D76Y-1, D76Y-2, E133Δ-1, and E133Δ-2. We typically obtained ∼10–30 mg of purified SOD1 protein from 2 liters of culture (∼3 × 109 cells). Fig.3A demonstrates the migration of purified WT and mutant SOD1s by denaturing SDS-PAGE using a standard Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer. Whereas most mutants demonstrated mobility comparable with that of WT SOD1, we observed a small but consistently accelerated migration for the mutants G85R and D90A, in agreement with previous reports (32Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Xu M. Guarnieri Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10468) Google Scholar), this differential mobility disappeared as a result of the WT and other mutant SOD1s migrating faster relative to marker proteins (not shown). A possible explanation for the relative acceleration of G85R and D90A on standard gels is that these mutants may have bound slightly more SDS than the WT protein as a result of more complete unfolding. In contrast to the relatively homogeneous appearance of the SOD1 proteins on denaturing PAGE, both WT and mutant as-isolated proteins migrated as a heterogeneous mixture of species during electrophoresis under native conditions (Fig. 3B). Commercially available human erythrocyte SOD1 (WT-C), which is almost fully metallated with copper and zinc ions, migrated as a single band on native PAGE. However, the as-isolated human WT protein from insect cells (WT, both panels of Fig.3B) consisted of at least three distinct species, two bands that migrated more rapidly and a third faint band of comparabl"
https://openalex.org/W2077029464,"Myosin-1c (also known as myosin-Ibeta) has been proposed to mediate the slow component of adaptation by hair cells, the sensory cells of the inner ear. To test this hypothesis, we mutated tyrosine-61 of myosin-1c to glycine, conferring susceptibility to inhibition by N(6)-modified ADP analogs. We expressed the mutant myosin-1c in utricular hair cells of transgenic mice, delivered an ADP analog through a whole-cell recording pipette, and found that the analog rapidly blocked adaptation to positive and negative deflections in transgenic cells but not in wild-type cells. The speed and specificity of inhibition suggests that myosin-1c participates in adaptation in hair cells."

Recent studies have revealed the role of several genes in the clock mechanism both inDrosophila and in mammals. To study how gene expression is globally regulated by the clock mechanism, we used a high density oligonucleotide probe array (GeneChip) to profile gene expression patterns in Drosophila under light-dark and constant dark conditions. We found 712 genes showing a daily fluctuation in mRNA levels under light-dark conditions, and among these the expression of 115 genes was still cycling in constant darkness, i.e.under free-running conditions. Unexpectedly the expression of a large number of genes cycled exclusively under constant darkness. We found that cycling in most of these genes was lost in the arrhythmicClock (Clk) mutant under light-dark conditions. Expression of periodically regulated genes is coordinated locally on chromosomes where small clusters of genes are regulated jointly.

The use of Drosophila has been at the forefront of studies of the molecular and genetic basis of circadian rhythms (1.Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). A number of clock genes have been identified in Drosophila, and interlocked per-tim and Clk feedback loops are now thought to underlie the central molecular machinery of circadian rhythms (2.Glossop N.R. Lyons L.C. Hardin P.E. Science. 1999; 286: 766-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3.Ueda H.R. Hagiwara M. Kitano H. J. Theor. Biol. 2001; 210: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, we still do not know how expression of the whole genome is orchestrated by the circadian mechanism nor have we identified all the genes involved. One comprehensive way to find out all the rhythmically expressed genes is to utilize microarray. A number of genes regulated in a circadian manner have been identified inArabidopsis and mammalian cultured cells (4.Harmer S.L. Hogenesch J.B. Staume M. Chang H.S. Han B. Zhu T. Wang X. Kreps J.A.

Since information about all the possible transcription units is available inDrosophila (6.Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A.

Functions of identified genes can be analyzed using various genetic tool and databases (9.Goto S. Nishioka T. Kanehisa M.

Flies were reared in a regime of 12 h of light followed by 12 h of darkness (LD), 1The abbreviations used are: LD12 h of light followed by 12 h of darknessDDconstant darkRTreverse transcriptionGABAγ-aminobutyric acidand collected every 4 h over 2 days. Total RNA was prepared from 100 heads of 1-week-old adult males and females using the Fast RNA kit (BIO 101, Inc.) followed by DNase treatment. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and was used as a template to synthesize biotin-labeled cRNA by in vitro transcription using an ENZO BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit. Amplified cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to GeneChip Drosophila arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) for 16 h at 45 °C. Hybridized arrays were washed, stained, and scanned using a Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner. Affymetrix GeneChip software was used to determine the average difference between perfectly matched oligonucleotide probes and single base pair mismatches for each probe set. Data were then scaled globally such that the total intensity of each microarray is equal. The resulting hybridization intensity values reflect the abundance of a given mRNA relative to the total RNA population and were used in all subsequent analyses. Quantitative PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 and SYBR Green reagents (Applied Biosystems). 12 h of light followed by 12 h of darkness constant dark reverse transcription γ-aminobutyric acid We examined gene expression profiles under LD using two successive filters: a periodic filter to extract genes with periodic expression patterns and a deviation filter to identify genes where the changes were above background level. First, to extract genes with periodic expression pattern, we empirically tested for statistically significant cross-correlation between the temporal expression profiles of each probe set and cosine waves of defined period and phases. We prepared cosine waves of nine test periodicities (τ) from 20 to 28 h in increments of 1 h. Cosine waves of each test period were considered over 60 phases (i.e. peaks at 60 equally spaced times in the defined period), yielding a total of 540 test cosine waves. Statistical significance was assessed by an empirical procedure. We generated ∼14,000 (the same number of probe sets) normally distributed random expression profiles. Then we calculated correlation between the random profiles and each of the 540 test cosine waves. Standard deviations and averages of cross-correlation were virtually equal for 540 cosine filters despite their different periods and phases. Thus, we searched for the common cut-off correlation of these cosine filters so that 95% of random expression profiles were filtered out after passing 540 parallel cosine filters. We determined this value as 99.8% probable correlation. This analysis is independent of signal strength and imposes no minimal change in amplitude. Next, to further extract genes whose variation was above background, we determined the noise level associated with a series of experimental procedures for each probe set. Two replicate samples (i.e.two sets of 100 fly heads collected independently at the same time of the day) were hybridized to two GeneChips. The standard deviation of the two signal intensities for each probe set was calculated and used as noise deviation (ς) in subsequent analysis. Expression profiles which, over the 12 time points, show a standard deviation (s) greater than noise deviation (ς) with 95% significance are classified as “changing.” 95% probability cut-off values are determined from χ2 (chi-square) distribution with 11 degrees of freedom ((12 − 1)s2/ς2 > 19.6751). To estimate the false positive rate, we generated ∼14,000 (the same number of probe sets) random expression profiles that were normally distributed using the noise deviations as determined above. Then we filtered these random expression profiles using two successive filters. Random profiles produced 27 genes classified as “periodically changing.” We assume that this estimates the false positive rate (i.e. 3.8% of all genes identified would be false positives). To analyze periodicity of gene expression profiles under constant dark (DD), we used damping cosine curves as test waves. We prepared damping cosine waves of four decay rates (k) from 0.0/h (no damping) to 0.03/h (half-life is 23.0 h) in increments of 0.01/h. Each was considered at nine test periodicities and over 60 phases as described above. We used the same cut-off cross-correlation values and the same deviation filters as in LD analysis. To determine the phase of cycling genes, we tested for correlation between the temporal expression profiles of each gene and 24-h period cosine waves at 60 different phases. We estimated the phase of each cycling gene from the phase of the cosine wave with which it was correlated most closely. We classified the cycling genes by biological process category in the Gene Ontology database (9.Goto S. Nishioka T. Kanehisa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For each category, we calculated the probability of finding at least r periodically regulated genes from the category size (n) using the cumulative hypergeometric probability distribution. Probability is given by: Probability=1−∑l=1r−1 ( ln)( R−lN−n)( nN)where N is the total number of genes within the genome, and R is the total number of periodically regulated genes. p values (−log10 (probability)) where the sum of probabilities is below 0.05 were considered significant. We also performed similar analyses using the LIGAND metabolic database (9.Goto S. Nishioka T. Kanehisa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We mapped cycling genes into the metabolic network inDrosophila and calculated the probability for observing at least r cycling genes within n enzymes metabolizing the same molecule using the cumulative hypergeometric probability distribution as above. For each gene, expression levels in ClkJrk mutants were averaged with those in wild-type flies. Both were kept in LD conditions, and equivalent points in the light-dark cycle were compared. Genes were classified as “up-regulated” if expression was at least 2 times higher in the mutant and “down-regulated” if expression was least 2 times lower in the mutant. Otherwise genes were classified as “unchanged.” Among 14,010 probes on the GeneChip, 44 probes are for control, and 299 probes map to multiple genes. The other 13,667 probes map to single genes. Among these, there are several redundant probe sets that map to the same gene, leaving 13,282 nonredundant probes. 12,795 of these match in FlyBase ID (10.FlyBaseNucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) to identified genes from Release 2 Drosophila genomic sequences (6.Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar, 7.Myers E.W.

We identified the chromosomal positions of all 12,795 genes using the BLASTN algorithm. Using the chromosomal positions obtained above, we mapped the genes belonging to each Class I, II, and III on chromosomes. To detect co-regulated regions, we calculated the correlation between expression patterns under LD conditions of genes on the same chromosome as described elsewhere (12.Cohen B.A. Mitra R.D. Hughes J.D. Church G.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). To identify significantly co-regulated regions, we calculated the average correlation of six adjacent genes and compared it with the average correlation of six nonadjacent genes as background. There were 140 chromosomal regions where the average correlation of the six adjacent genes was more than 3.5 standard deviations from background,i.e. the mean average correlation of six nonadjacent genes. This analysis showed that a substantial number of adjacent sets have correlated expression patterns in comparison with 25 expected co-regulated regions derived from a control set of nonadjacent genes. Similar results were obtained from analysis of 2–10 adjacent genes. Among 140 chromosomal regions, 38 clusters of genes included periodically regulated genes. We also analyzed co-expressed region under the DD condition and obtained similar results to the LD condition. We have examined temporal patterns of gene expression under LD and under DD using a GeneChip (Affymetrix) representing the entire genome (more than 13,500 genes) of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were collected every 4 h over 2 days both in LD and DD, and biotin-labeled probes made from cDNA from 100 heads were used for hybridization. We estimate that the expression of 6,061 genes (43.4% of all genes) was detected on GeneChip. The number of genes detected here is thought to be delimited by the detection method using GeneChip, and there should be additional cycling genes expressed at a lower level or in a small number of cells. Data were analyzed through two sequential statistical filters, and 712 genes (5.3% of the whole genome) were classified as periodically regulated genes in LD (Fig. 1a). This is likely to be a minimum number for the genes that are periodically regulated; the number may increase if a different filtration analysis was applied. Our analyses might not detect genes that cycle in some cells but not in others, and moreover, it is technically difficult to monitor genes with very low levels of transcription. The number of periodically regulated genes in Drosophila is similar to that reported fromArabidopsis under constant light (4.Harmer S.L. Hogenesch J.B. Staume M. Chang H.S. Han B. Zhu T. Wang X. Kreps J.A. Kay S.A. Science. 2000; 290: 2110-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), in which 6% of genes investigated are rhythmic, but is in contrast to cyanobacteria, in which nearly all genes are expressed periodically (13.Liu Y.

We found that genes implicated in circadian rhythms, including period(per) (14.Hardin P.E. Hall J.C. Rosbash M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6935-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), cycled with high amplitude and in similar phase, as previously reported, validating our experimental and statistic procedures (Fig. 1e). We analyzed the phase of periodically regulated genes at a resolution of 0.4 h and found two peaks around ZT10 and ZT20 (Fig. 1c). The peaks may reflect the after-effect of the change from dark to light and light to dark since significant peaks were absent under the constant dark condition (Fig. 1d). The peak phases of the clock genes, Clk, cry,per, vri, tim, and to, were not at these times. We then analyzed the gene expression under DD (Fig. 1b) and found that 115 genes of 712 were still periodically regulated in the free-running condition (Class I, periodically regulated both in LD and DD). The remaining 597 genes were judged to be periodically regulated only in LD (Class II). Surprisingly 341 genes that were not judged as periodically regulated under LD were, however, periodically regulated under DD (Class III). Their cyclings might have been suppressed or masked under LD as suggested from behavioral experiments (19.Mrosovsky N. Chronobiol. Int. 1999; 16: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In our classification of genes we should note that because we used a strict filter to identify periodically regulated genes, genes judged to be not cycling might in fact cycle with low amplitude. Lists of all genes in each class may be found in Supplemental Tables I–III. After completion of our work two similar works using GeneChip were published (20.Claridge-Chang A. Wijnen H. Naef F. Boothroyd C. Rajewsky N. Young M.W. Neuron. 2001; 32: 657-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21.McDonald M.J. Rosbach M. Cell. 2001; 107: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Their findings are similar to ours, but there are several differences, specifically the Class II and III genes were not mentioned in other studies. We think that the major differences are the numbers of sampling and statistical analyses. We analyzed data for 2 days both under LD and DD, while the previous studies analyzed data only for 1 day in each light condition. Several interesting periodically regulated genes were identified from the three classes, I, II, and III (Fig. 2). The reliability of GeneChip data was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR analyses, which confirmed that both methods yielded similar data. A novel candidate of clock genes,Pdp1, showing a robust cycling (Fig. 2a), encodes a transcription factor with homology to vri (16.Blau J. Young M.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Most of the genes we found to cycle could be classified according to the category of their “biological process” as defined in the Gene Ontology database (8.Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. et al.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (27692) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Tables IV and V). Phototransduction is one such category, which includes a significant number of periodically regulated genes. Two of these were Class I genes. Photoreceptor dehydrogenase, Pdh, also showed a clear cyclical expression (Fig. 2). One retinoid-binding protein (CG5958) was periodically expressed with peak at dusk, while the other retinoid-binding protein (CG10657) belonging to Class II was cycling with almost opposite phases. A number of genes belonged to Class II. Three opsins, Rh3, Rh4, and Rh6, which express in the central rhabdomeres of the compound eye's ommatidia, showed rhythmic expression. Another opsin, Rh5, belonged to Class III. The ninaA gene encoding cyclophilin, which transports opsins from endoplasmic reticulum to microvilli membrane, also showed rhythmic expression. Molecules associating with Ca2+ signal transduction in the photoreceptors,inaC, inaD, and trpl, also cycled (Fig. 2b). The expression of most genes listed above peaked in the morning, whereas Rh6 and trpl peaked in the evening. Visual sensitivity is controlled by a circadian rhythm in insects (22.Chen B. Meinertzhagen I.A. Shaw S.R. J. Comp.

Nishioka T. Kanehisa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to examine the functional significance of periodically regulated genes (Supplemental Tables VI and VII). Enzymes and transporters involved in metabolism or function of glutamate and GABA were periodically regulated.Eaat1, CG5618, and CG7470 are Class I genes, andGdh, black, CG4233, and CG7433 are Class II genes. Gs1 belongs to Class III. All genes except CG4233 showed robust rhythmicity with peaks in the dark phase. In mammals, glutamate (23.Ding J.M. Chen D. Weber E.T. Faiman L.E. Rea M.A. Gillette M.U. Science. 1994; 266: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and GABA (24.Moore R.Y. Speh J.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 150: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) are neurotransmitters associated with clock function. These molecules mimic the dark pulse to a circadian rhythm in the optic lobe of Musca (25.Pyza E. Meinertzhagen I.A. J. Comp. Physiol. 1996; 178: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, one type of glutamate receptor is highly enriched in pacemaker neurons (26.Volkner M. Lenz-Bohme B. Betz H. Schmitt B. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and our data suggest glutamate and GABA might have a role in the circadian mechanism. In the light of a recent finding that the redox state of NAD cofactors is involved in circadian rhythms (27.Rutter J. Reick M. Wu L.C. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), it is interesting that many enzymes related to NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH metabolism were periodically regulated. There are 16 periodically regulated genes directly associated to the synthesis of these nicotinamide nucleotides. Three are in Class I, and the remaining 13 are in Class II. Their peaks expression occurred in three phases under LD: noon, dusk, and night. We next examined the cycling of gene expression in the arrhythmic mutant of the Clock (Clk) gene (11.Allada R. White N.E. So W.V. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Cell. 1998; 93: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) under LD. Our study showed that many genes are cycling only in LD, and we then asked whether the cyclings of the Class II genes are merely a reflection of light responses. Homozygous ClkJrk mutants show completely arrhythmic locomotor behavior under DD (11.Allada R. White N.E. So W.V. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Cell. 1998; 93: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). CLK is a transcription factor and activates clock-regulated genes (1.Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 2.Glossop N.R. Lyons L.C. Hardin P.E.

Cell. 1998; 93: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In the Clk mutant, periodically expression of all the clock genes disappeared (Fig. 1e), and only a few genes were judged to cycle under LD (7, 16, and 23 genes in Class I, II, and III, respectively; Supplemental Table VIII). It is possible that the cycling genes in the ClkJrk mutant may represent genes controlled by a possible CLK-independent mechanism. We did not analyze the cycling pattern with two peaks in a day. If cycling is simply controlled by light-on and -off, it shows a pattern with dual peaks in a day. We did not investigate this possibility, but genes belonging to the Class III may have such a property. Further studies are necessary to investigate this possibility. Our results suggest that the cycling of the Class II genes is not merely a result of light exposure during LD but is under circadian control. Under LD, the expression levels of per,tim, vri, and to were decreased relative to Clk (Fig. 1e), whereas Clkand cry continue to express at a high level as previously shown (11.Allada R. White N.E. So W.V. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Cell. 1998; 93: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 17.Emery P. So W.V. Kaneko M. Hall J.C. Rosbash M. Cell. 1998; 95: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the expression patterns of seven genes inClkJrk. If the transcription level of a gene is lowered in ClkJrk, the gene might be up-regulated by Clk, whereas if the level is not affected, the gene might be regulated by a CLK-independent mechanism. The expression of about 6% of genes was decreased, while in about 3% of genes it was increased. In the latter case, their transcription might normally be down-regulated by genes controlled by CLK. These results indicate that CLK regulates transcription in many genes, but there are other genes in which transcription is not directly controlled by CLK. In addition some genes might be negatively regulated by CLK. We do not think that these changes are caused by the genetic background differences as we dealt with genes whose expression level changed over 2-fold or one-half. Our study thus shows that a single mutation in such a central gene regulator results in global but differential changes of gene expression. We mapped the chromosomal locations of genes belonging to each class (I, II, and III) and found that they were not randomly distributed but clustered on chromosomes. There were 15 clusters where periodically regulated genes occupied a highly condensed chromosome interval. This suggests that temporal gene expression might be locally regulated on chromosomes. To confirm this possibility, we calculated the correlation of temporal expression pattern along the neighboring genes on all chromosomes and found 140 chromosomal regions where neighboring genes are expressed with a similar pattern to each other. Among them, 38 regions contained at least one periodically regulated gene. There were six genes in Class I, 24 in Class II, and eight in Class III. For example, the expression patterns of six neighboring genes belonging to the cytochrome P450 family, located on the right arm of the second chromosome, are similar (Fig. 3,a and b). There is a region where genes are co-regulated, but their functions are unknown (Fig. 3, c andd). Moreover, we found that functionally unrelated genes are co-regulated (Fig. 3, e and f). These results suggest that the temporal expression of neighboring genes is influenced by a periodically regulated gene. Searches of each class of periodically regulated genes so far failed to reveal any common motifs in the nucleic acid sequence along the putative regulatory region of each class of cycling genes. We found that the co-regulation of temporal expression occurs even more globally. The co-regulated regions were observed along the fourth chromosome at intervals of about 5–10 genes (data not shown). The regular spacing suggests control at the level of higher order chromatin structure as previously reported in suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons (28.Crosio C. Cermakian N. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These results suggest that gene expression on chromosomes is globally regulated by circadian mechanisms, although we still do not know their molecular bases. Coordinated gene regulation at the chromatin level might be an economical way in remodeling chromosome structures. Our study thus reveals the complex transcriptional orchestration of genes under LD and DD conditions in Drosophila. Although cycling gene expression is not always essential for circadian function, in clock genes such as cyc (29.Rutila J.E. Suri V. Le M. So W.V. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 93: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and double-time(30.Price J.L. Blau J. Rothenfluh A. Abodeely M. Kloss B. Young M.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) our study has established the candidacy of many candidate genes that might be implicated in circadian mechanisms. Further work using genetic tools available in Drosophila should help to explore the function of these genes with the prospect of leading to a greater understanding of the molecular basis of circadian rhythms in all organisms.

https://openalex.org/W1969345055,"Hyperforin is a plant derived antibiotic from St. John's wort. Here we describe a novel activity of hyperforin, namely its ability to inhibit the growth of tumour cells by induction of apoptosis. Hyperforin inhibited the growth of various human and rat tumour cell lines in vivo, with IC(50) values between 3-15 microM. Treatment of tumour cells with hyperforin resulted in a dose-dependent generation of apoptotic oligonucleosomes, typical DNA-laddering and apoptosis-specific morphological changes. In MT-450 mammary carcinoma cells hyperforin increased the activity of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and hyperforin-mediated apoptosis was blocked by the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. When added to MT-450 cells, hyperforin, but not paclitaxel, induced a rapid loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential Deltapsi(m), and subsequent morphological changes such as homogenization and vacuolization of mitochondria. Monitoring of Deltapsi(m) revealed that the hyperforin-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition can not be prevented by zVAD.fmk. This indicates that mitochondrial permeabilization is a cause rather than a consequence of caspase activation. Moreover, hyperforin was capable of releasing cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria. These findings suggest that hyperforin activates a mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. In vivo, hyperforin inhibited the growth of autologous MT-450 breast carcinoma in immunocompetent Wistar rats to a similar extent as the cytotoxic drug paclitaxel, without any signs of acute toxicity. Owing to the combination of significant antitumour activity, low toxicity in vivo and natural abundance of the compound, hyperforin holds the promise of being an interesting novel antineoplastic agent that deserves further laboratory and in vivo exploration."

A conserved intrasubunit disulfide bond involving Cys-57 also stabilizes the enzyme by anchoring a loop that forms part of the dimer interface to the β-barrel at Cys-146. A subset of SOD1 mutations in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) have been proposed to destabilize the β-barrel or disrupt dimerization of SOD1 monomers (13Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A.

However, a quantitative analysis of FALS mutant SOD1 structural stability and its relation to metal occupancy has not been reported. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 14 ALS-associated mutations on the thermodynamic stability of biologically metallated human SOD1s. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we measured the melting temperatures (Tm) of WT SOD1 and mutant variants hypothesized to perturb the active site region, the dimer interface, one pole of the β-barrel, and associated loops. We distinguished the melting properties of partially metallated SOD1 species and showed that mutant SOD1 proteins were destabilized relative to the corresponding WT species. Recombinant human WT and mutant SOD1 enzymes (A4V, L38V, G41S, H46R, H48Q, G72S, D76Y, G85R, D90A, G93A, D124V, D125H, E133Δ, and S134N) were expressed in a baculovirus/Sf21 insect cell system and purified as previously described (18Hayward L.J.

Protein concentrations were estimated using a dimeric molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 10,800m−1·cm−1 (19Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). The copper and zinc contents of these biologically metallated proteins were previously determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A.

SOD1 protein concentrations were adjusted to 2 mg/ml for all samples in a reference buffer containing 50 mm KCl and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(I) in some samples immediately before calorimetric analysis by the addition of a small excess of dithionite (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of WT SOD1 and FALS-associated mutant SOD1s was measured using a Nano II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.). The calorimeter was equipped with two U-shaped cells, a reference cell and a sample cell, each with a capacity of 326.8 μl. In all DSC experiments, the sample cell was filled with a protein solution in the same buffer used to fill the reference cell. All buffers and protein solutions were degassed for 15 min using a vacuum generated by a water aspirator. A buffer versus buffer base line was measured prior to the calorimetric analysis of protein samples. All samples were run in duplicate through a temperature range of 25–100 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min under 3 atm of pressure. CpCalc software (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.) was used to determine molar heat capacity values, and Origin software (Microcal) was used to fit the data to a non-two-state thermal transition model (21Edge V. Allewell N.M. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which has been used previously for DSC studies of SOD1 (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Base line curves were derived by connecting the pre- and post-transition base lines. Each Tm value was determined within an error of ±0.5 °C, unless otherwise specified, after deconvolution of the DSC profiles into individual components. Summation of the deconvoluted components agreed well with the observed DSC traces. It was not possible to determine accurate enthalpy values for many of the endotherms at higher temperatures due to the irreversible melting behavior of human WT and FALS-associated SOD1s. However, sharp exothermic transitions typical of aggregation mainly occurred after a given endothermic unfolding peak had already formed in the DSC profiles. Therefore, Tm values were less affected by aggregation and were used to compare relative thermal stabilities of the enzymes. The heat-induced unfolding of a partially metallated sample of human WT SOD1 produced a DSC profile consisting of multiple overlapping endothermic transitions (Fig. 1A). Deconvolution of the DSC trace using a non-two-state transition model yielded three endotherms, consistent with the unfolding of differentially metallated SOD1 species (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Tm values obtained for the three transitions of this WT SOD1 sample were 60.8, 75.7, and 83.7 °C and were denoted as Tm1,Tm2, andTm3, respectively (Fig. 1A). The occurrence of multiple endotherms was not surprising, because these biologically metallated SOD1 enzymes that were overexpressed in insect cells exhibited incomplete metal occupancy (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). DSC measurements reflect the sum of any endothermic (e.g.unfolding) or exothermic (e.g. aggregation) processes during slow heating of the sample. As has been noted in previous DSC studies, SOD1 undergoes irreversible unfolding upon heating to high temperatures (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the apparent molar enthalpy for a given transition depends on the area under the endotherm, aggregation during the DSC scan may contribute to underestimation of the true enthalpy of SOD1 denaturation. However, the Tm values of the DSC transitions, which were highly reproducible from run to run, served as a useful estimate of relative thermostability. The deconvolution model for obtaining the Tm values was validated by the close alignment of the experimental and calculated traces (Fig.1B). To observe the influence of metal binding upon SOD1 stability, we performed DSC upon two differentially metallated samples for each of the WT, H46R, D76Y, G85R, and E133Δ SOD1 proteins. Occupancy of the copper and zinc binding sites for these samples (Table I) was influenced either by metal ion supplementation to the medium during protein expression (for the WT, H46R, or G85R samples) or by fractionation during ion exchange chromatography (for the D76Y and E133Δ samples) (18Hayward L.J.

Open table in a new tab Tm1, Tm2,Tm3, and Tm4represent the melting temperatures of distinct WT or mutant SOD1 species in our as-isolated protein samples. Melting temperatures were averaged from two independent DSC profiles after deconvolution of the corresponding endotherms. Tm values marked with an asterisk were derived from deconvolution of a single endotherm if the duplicate scan exhibited excessive sample aggregation. DSC scans for E133Δ-1 and E133Δ-2 samples in Fig.2A each exhibited two distinct endotherms, centered near 55 and 71 °C, and an overlapping transition near 76 °C that appeared as a smaller shoulder. An exothermic transition above 80 °C most likely reflected aggregation of the sample. E133Δ-1, which contained more metal ions than did E133Δ-2, yielded a smaller endotherm at 55.9 °C and larger endotherms relative to E133Δ-2 at 71.9 and 76.8 °C. This suggested that the species unfolding during the two more stable transitions had greater metal occupancy than did the species producing the least stable endotherm. A similar effect of metal ion content on endotherm magnitudes was observed for the differentially metallated fractions of D76Y SOD1 (not shown). Substitution of a copper ligand with arginine in H46R SOD1 abolished Cu(II) ion binding to the catalytic site and also altered the zinc binding site (23Liu H. Zhu H. Eggers D.K. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Ai J.J. Goto J. Sanders-Loehr J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We compared preparations of H46R purified from cells grown in medium supplemented with either a 50 μm (H46R-A) or 300 μm (H46R-B) concentration of copper and zinc ions. H46R-B contained a small but significant amount of zinc that was not present in H46R-A (Table I). DSC scans of H46R-A exhibited a single transition near 56 °C that reflected unfolding of the metal-free protein (Fig. 2B). For H46R-B, binding of 0.07 equivalents of zinc per dimer correlated with a decrease in the magnitude of the main transition and the appearance of a new endotherm near 72 °C. These data suggested that zinc binding increased theTm for H46R SOD1 by ∼16 °C. This stabilization paralleled the difference between Tm2and Tm1 observed for both WT and E133Δ human SOD1s (Table I) and was also consistent with a previous study showing that zinc binding to bovine SOD1 apoenzyme increases itsTm by ∼13 °C (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Reduction of copper in the fully metallated bovine SOD1 enzyme increases its thermal stability by ∼4 °C compared with the oxidized form under similar scan conditions (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To discern which endotherm(s) represented the unfolding of a copper-containing species, we reduced Cu(II) to Cu(I) in samples of WT and A4V SOD1 proteins by incubation with dithionite. Fig.3A shows that WT SOD1 reduced by dithionite exhibited an increase inTm3 from 83.3 to 86.1 °C, whileTm1 andTm2 remained unchanged. A similar effect was observed in the reduced form of the A4V mutant, with a shift inTm3 from 76.6 to 80.5 °C (Fig.3B). The increase in Tm3 may be related to relaxation of strain in the protein upon rearrangement of the ligand geometry to that preferred by Cu(I). These results implicated the endotherm at Tm3 as the unfolding transition of a species that contained copper. We previously identified eight mutants (A4V, L38V, G41S, G72S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133Δ) that shared “WT-like” copper coordination and full activity of bound copper (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we observed that the DSC profiles for these mutants each contained multiple endotherms that probably reflected unfolding of distinctly metallated species, as was seen for the WT protein. These transitions were labeled numerically from lowest to highest Tm value observed for each mutant (Table I; Tm1,Tm2, Tm3, and Tm4). The lowest melting transition for each WT-like mutant was destabilized by an average of 4.7 ± 1.8 °C (range 0.8–6.6 °C, Table I) compared with the corresponding transition for the WT protein. The three major melting transitions observed for the A4V and L38V mutant species are compared with those for WT SOD1 in Fig.4. While the extent of destabilization varied among different mutants, all three transitions for a given mutant exhibited a comparable instability with respect to the corresponding WT SOD1 transitions. The difference in temperature between Tm1 andTm2 remained nearly constant (∼14–16 °C) for all of these WT-like mutants (Table I). Similarly, the Tm associated with the copper-containing species, Tm3, was ∼21–24 °C higher than Tm1 for each WT-like mutant (Table I). This suggested that binding of metal ions to either the WT or WT-like mutant enzymes afforded a similar incremental gain in stability. The four WT-like mutants G41S, G72S, D76Y, and G93A exhibited an additional endotherm centered near 90 °C (Table I), as shown in the profiles of G41S and G93A SOD1s (Fig. 5). The melting temperature associated with this endotherm (Tm4) was consistently ∼33–35 °C higher than Tm1. Under the same DSC conditions, we observed a major melting transition at 93 °C for fully metallated human WT SOD1 isolated from erythrocytes (not shown). This suggested that Tm4 corresponded to unfolding of a subpopulation of fully metallated dimers. Five “metal-binding region” SOD1 mutants (H46R, G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N) were severely metal-deficient (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), indicating that the metal-free apoprotein was the main constituent of these samples (TableI). The mutants G85R, D124V, and D125H exhibited unique DSC profiles (Fig. 6) and transitions that could not be directly correlated with those of the “WT-like” mutants, which were likely to contain much less apoprotein according to the metal content analysis. The G85R mutant exhibited a main transition centered at 49 °C (Fig.6A) and was the most destabilized species that we observed. Moreover, G85R SOD1 began to unfold at the near physiological temperature of 42 °C. This major transition most likely arose from melting of the G85R apoprotein, while minor transitions seen at 58, 72, and 82 °C may have represented unfolding of partially metallated species. The DSC profile of D124V was composed of a shoulder at 54.1 °C and a main transition at 57.8 °C (Fig. 6B). Because metals were almost undetectable in the D124V sample (Table I), this result suggested that the endotherms near 56 °C arose from melting of a metal-free protein. The precise species that produced these two overlapping transitions and possible cooperative unfolding interactions remain to be clarified. The exotherm near 76 °C most likely arose from aggregation or precipitation of unfolded proteins. The DSC profile of the D125H mutant exhibited a major endotherm at 54.0 °C that evolved into a prominent exotherm, probably related to aggregation or precipitation, as the temperature approached 66 °C (Fig. 6C). Given the low metal content of D125H SOD1, it is likely that the transition at 54.0 °C arose from melting of an apoprotein and that the transition at 82.8 °C was produced by unfolding of either a metal-containing species or an unusually stable, nonnative form of the enzyme. The H48Q mutant contained substantial amounts of copper and zinc ions (Table I) when compared with other metal binding region mutants yet contained less zinc than the WT samples (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The DSC profile of H48Q SOD1 contained three main endotherms (Fig.7). AlthoughTm1 was centered near 60 °C for both WT and H48Q SOD1, the H48Q species began to unfold ∼5 °C below that of WT SOD1 and produced a broader endothermic transition. This indicated that this H48Q species was destabilized and suggested that it unfolded with less cooperativity compared with the WT species. The other two endotherms for H48Q, which most likely arose from unfolding of proteins containing bound metal ions, could not be definitively assigned to corresponding transitions of the WT enzyme. We measured the thermal unfolding behavior of partially metallated species of WT and 14 mutant SOD1s associated with familial ALS (TableI). Copper and zinc ions were more likely to be bound to their correct sites in these biologically metallated proteins compared with SOD1 proteins remetallated in vitro (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A.

Our initial experiments using DSC correlated increased metal contents with the unfolding of more stable SOD1 species (Fig. 2). For the WT and A4V mutants, we also identified the unfolding of copper-containing species at Tm3, whereas transitions atTm1 andTm2 most likely resulted from melting of SOD1 subunits lacking copper (Fig. 3). Eight of the FALS-associated mutants (A4V, L38V, G41S, G72S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133Δ) shared copper coordination and specific activities comparable with WT SOD1 (18Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A.

For these “WT-like” mutants, Tm2 was consistently ∼14–16 °C higher than Tm1, whileTm3 was consistently ∼21–24 °C higher than Tm1 (Table I). These results indicate that each mutant in this group preserved the structural interactions important for metal-induced stabilization. However, these WT-like mutants all exhibited reduced thermal stabilities when compared with corresponding WT SOD1 species (Table I). Heating of four mutant SOD1s (G93A, G41S, G72S, and D76Y) produced an additional endotherm near 90 °C (Tm4). The appearance of this transition correlated with the mutant proteins containing the highest amounts of copper (Table I). Fully metallated bovine SOD1 unfolds at a similar temperature (∼92 °C) when heated at a comparable rate and concentration (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the transition atTm4 in our study arose from a subpopulation of SOD1s containing two Cu(II) and two Zn(II) ions per dimer, whereas Tm3 reflected the unfolding of partially metallated species that contained copper. A previous DSC analysis by Lepock et al. (22Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of recombinant WT human SOD1 expressed in yeast produced major endotherms at 74.9 °C (component 1) and 83.6 °C (component 2). These transitions were assumed to arise from fully metallated species of SOD1 containing oxidized and reduced copper, respectively, but the total metal contents and the oxidation states of copper were not reported. Our results are consistent with those of Lepock et al. (22Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) if components 1 and 2 in their study correspond to the transitions at Tm2 (species lacking copper but probably stabilized by zinc) andTm3 (partially metallated species containing copper) observed for WT SOD1 in the present work. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that human SOD1 proteins expressed in yeast may be undermetallated (19Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30104-30109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The Tm of a SOD1 subunit within a dimeric species probably depends on both its metal occupancy and its interactions with the partner subunit. In addition, the heating procedure during DSC may favor the rearrangement or consolidation of SOD1 species into more stable dimers (25Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6927-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). For example, denaturation or dissociation of a less stable subunit in a partially metallated dimer during slow heating would be expected also to decrease the stability of the partner subunit upon loss of strong intersubunit hydrophobic interactions. If monomerization of the partner occurs during heating, exposure of its hydrophobic dimer interface to the solvent would be thermodynamically unfavorable. The partner subunit may retain its full stability by reassociation with a similarly stable subunit to produce a new population of more completely metallated dimers. Why did we observe a maximum of four distinct unfolding transitions for the biologically metallated SOD1 enzymes? If metal ions are incorporated into their proper sites, such that four potential metallation states exist for each SOD1 subunit (E-E, Cu-E, E-Zn, or Cu-Zn, where “E” refers to an empty metal binding site), then a total of 10 distinctly metallated dimeric SOD1 species or four monomeric species could be present in our samples. It is possible that many of these species exist but that the melting transitions within specific subsets overlap sufficiently to become indistinguishable by DSC. Alternatively, only a fraction of these possible species may occurin vivo, since metal ion incorporation into SOD1 may be a cooperative process (5Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Prior stabilization by zinc binding, for example, might be important for biological incorporation of copper into SOD1. Many of the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain FALS mutant SOD1 toxicity (14Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) presume an altered conformation of mutant compared with WT SOD1. Decreased mutant SOD1 stability may help to explain how >90 mutations scattered over more than one-third of the residues in this enzyme all cause a similar phenotype. The extreme thermochemical stability of fully metallated normal SOD1 implies that selection has occurred against less stable forms of the enzyme. We have shown here that some FALS-associated SOD1 mutants are less stable than corresponding WT forms despite binding similar amounts of metal ions. We hypothesize that the observed thermal destabilization of the mutant enzymes in vitro may parallel a susceptibility to specific biochemical denaturing stresses in vivo. Although mutants such as D90A or G93A exhibited only a mild reduction in global stability as measured by DSC, it is possible that a more localized instability may be pertinent to mutant SOD1 toxicity. Consistent with this view, D90A SOD1 exhibits an accelerated loss of dismutase activity compared with WT SOD1 upon exposure to either high temperature (73 °C, ∼3-fold acceleration) or denaturant (3.5 mguanidinium chloride, ∼6-fold acceleration) (26Marklund S.L. Andersen P.M. Forsgren L. Nilsson P. Ohlsson P.I. Wikander G. Oberg A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). While loss of dismutase activity itself is unlikely to be the toxic property of D90A SOD1, it may reflect a more ominous tendency of the enzyme to unfold locally. For other SOD1 mutants, a decreased metal content greatly increases the fraction of destabilized protein. Six of the mutant proteins investigated here had substitutions that either perturb a copper ligand (H46R and H48Q) or may disrupt other important motifs in the metal binding region (G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N). It is possible that metal loss from mutant SOD1 in the presence of other cellular denaturing influences may contribute to an increased burden of misfolded proteins at physiological temperatures. Indeed, recent analyses of SOD1 transgenic mice (27Watanabe M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Cizewski Culotta V. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Rothstein J.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) or rats (28Nagai M. Aoki M. Miyoshi I. Kato M. Pasinelli P. Kasai N. Brown Jr., R.H. Itoyama Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9246-9254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that those models expressing the metal-binding region mutants (H46R or G85R) exhibit frequent inclusion bodies recognized by antibodies to SOD1 or ubiquitin, while those models expressing the β-barrel pole mutants (G37R or G93A) exhibit fewer inclusions but more prominent vacuolar changes. Our investigations of thermal stability for a large group of SOD1 variants associated with familial ALS have led to three significant observations: 1) distinct species within heterogeneous mixtures of partially metallated SOD1 can be effectively compared using DSC; 2) many mutants retain the ability to be stabilized upon metal ion binding or to be destabilized upon metal loss; and 3) all of the mutant proteins exhibit some degree of reduced stability compared with WT SOD1. The contribution of decreased SOD1 conformational stability to the pathogenesis of familial ALS remains to be explored in greater cellular and molecular detail."
https://openalex.org/W2125562692,"Three membrane microdomains can be identified on docked vacuoles: ""outside"" membrane, not in contact with other vacuoles, ""boundary"" membrane that contacts adjacent vacuoles, and ""vertices,"" where boundary and outside membrane meet. In living cells and in vitro, vacuole fusion occurs at vertices rather than from a central pore expanding radially. Vertex fusion leaves boundary membrane within the fused organelle and is an unexpected pathway for the formation of intralumenal membranes. Proteins that regulate docking and fusion (Vac8p, the GTPase Ypt7p, its HOPS/Vps-C effector complex, the t-SNARE Vam3p, and protein phosphatase 1) accumulate at these vertices during docking. Their vertex enrichment requires cis-SNARE complex disassembly and is thus part of the normal fusion pathway."

Global comparison of transcription in Stat3beta(+/+) and Stat3beta(-/-) cells revealed stable differences. Stat3beta-deficient mice exhibit diminished recovery from endotoxic shock and hyperresponsiveness of a subset of endotoxin-inducible genes in liver. The hepatic response to endotoxin in wild-type mice is accompanied by a transient increase in the ratio of Stat3beta to Stat3alpha.

https://openalex.org/W2018020379,"Tankyrase 1, a human telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was originally identified through its interaction with TRF1, a negative regulator of telomere length. Tankyrase 1 ADP-ribosylates TRF1 in vitro, and its overexpression induces telomere elongation in human cancer cells. In addition to its telomeric localization, tankyrase 1 resides at multiple subcellular sites, suggesting additional functions for this protein. Here we identify TAB182, a novel tankyrase 1-binding protein of 182 kDa. TAB182 displays a complex pattern of subcellular localization. TAB182 localizes to the nucleus in a heterochromatic staining pattern and to the cytoplasm, where it co-stains with the cortical actin network. TAB182 coimmunoprecipitates with tankyrase 1 from human cells and serves as an acceptor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by tankyrase 1 in vitro. Like TRF1, TAB182 binds to the ankyrin domain (comprising 24 ankyrin repeats) of tankyrase 1. Surprisingly, dissection of this domain reveals multiple discrete and overlapping binding sites for TRF1 and TAB182. Thus, we demonstrate five well conserved ankyrin repeat clusters in tankyrase 1. Although each of the five ankyrin repeat clusters independently binds to TRF1, only three of the five bind toTAB182. These findings suggest that tankyrase 1 may act as a scaffold for large molecular mass complexes made up of multiple binding proteins. We discuss potential roles for tankyrase 1-mediated higher order complexes at telomeres and at other subcellular sites."
https://openalex.org/W2070044709,"UBP43 is a protease that specifically removes a ubiquitin-like protein, ISG15, from its targets. Highest levels ofUBP43 expression are detected in macrophages and in cell lines of monocytic lineage. Macrophages are important in host defense against bacterial and viral infections. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the bacterial cell wall can mimic bacteria and activate monocytes/macrophages to provoke inflammatory responses. Here, we report that LPS strongly activates UBP43 expression in macrophages, which is paralleled by changes in UBP43 protein levels.

We have identified two members of the IRF family (IRF-2 and IRF-3) that specifically bind to these sites. IRF-3 plays a primary role in the LPS-inducible activation of theUBP43 gene and IRF-2 confers a basal transcriptional activity to the UBP43 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LPS treatment increases the amount of ISG15-conjugates in macrophages.

More recently, a sizeable group of ubiquitin-related proteins have come to light; at least a dozen distinct ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) 1The abbreviations used are: Ublubiquitin-like proteinEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayIFNinterferonIRFinterferon regulatory factorIRFEinterferon regulatory factor binding elementISGinterferon-stimulated geneMEFmurine embryonal fibroblastUBP (=USP)ubiquitin-specific proteaseLPSlipopolysaccharide similarly ubiquitin form covalent attachments to other macromolecules (1.Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Ubls mediate an impressive range of cellular functions, including cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis, suggesting that covalent posttranslational modification of proteins is a versatile principle of determining the half-life, intracellular localization, and activity of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2.Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin cross-reactive protein, better known as IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), was the first example of a growing class of ubiquitin-like proteins that includes SUMO-1, Nedd8, and FAT 10 (3.Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). ISG15 is one of the most strongly induced genes after interferon (IFN) treatment (4.Farrell P.J. Broeze R.J. Lengyel P.

Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It functions intracellularly as a ubiquitin homolog and can form conjugates with certain cellular proteins, a substantial amount of which are colocalized with intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton (10.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Conjugation of Ubls including ISG15 occurs by a mechanism similar but distinct from ubiquitination (11.Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It involves a three-step mechanism where specific enzymes (or enzyme complexes) activate and covalently link Ubls to their substrates (12.Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 13.Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). An ISG15-activating enzyme has been recently identified as Ube1L (7.Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Interestingly, UBE1L was found to be absent in 14 different lung cancer cell lines tested, suggesting a possible link between block of ISG15 conjugation and carcinogenesis (14.McLaughlin P.M. Helfrich W. Kok K. Mulder M. Hu S.W. Brinker M.G. Ruiters M.H. de Leij L.F. Buys C.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Monocytes and lymphocytes can release free ISG15 (15.Knight Jr., E. Cordova B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2280-2284PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokine-like properties of ISG15, such as the induction of IFN-γ production and augmentation of natural killer/lymphokine-activated killer cell proliferation and function (16.D'Cunha J.

Ubiquitin (or Ubl)-substrate deconjugation is performed by members of a diverse group of specialized cysteine proteases called deubiquitinating enzymes or ubiquitin-specific proteases. UBP43 (USP18), a member of the ubiquitin protease family, has been cloned in our laboratory during the analysis of differential gene expression in hematopoietic tissues of AML1-ETO knock-in mice (17.Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). UBP43 encodes a 43-kDa protein and exhibits homology to catalytic domains of ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) that function to release free ubiquitin from ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Recently, we have demonstrated that UBP43 is a major ISG15-specific protease and activity of this enzyme is crucial for maintaining a proper balance of ISG15-conjugated proteins in cells (18.Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Vertebrates and invertebrates respond to bacterial invasion by activation of a defense mechanism that is part of the innate immune response (19.Kimbrell D.A. Beutler B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This response is mainly triggered by the recognition of LPS, which are cell wall components of Gram-negative bacteria (20.Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In mammals, it is primarily monocytes and macrophages that respond to LPS by releasing cytokines and chemokines to provoke inflammatory responses (21.Raetz C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5745-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). After exposure to LPS, the macrophages undergo profound changes in protein composition that include alteration of cell surface, secreted, and intracellular products. The changes in LPS-stimulated macrophages include transcriptional activation of multiple genes, which may contribute to the natural immunity to microorganisms. We previously reported that the highest level of murineUBP43 expression was detected in thymus and peritoneal macrophages of normal adult mice. Among various hematopoietic cell lines tested, monocyte/macrophage lines also exhibited the highest level of UBP43 expression (17.Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Macrophages are primary effector cells in host defense, and high activity of the UBP43 may play an important role in their function as well as have an affect on overall immune response. These facts directed us to identify transacting factors regulating the expression of this gene under normal and stressed conditions. In this report we show that UBP43is strongly up-regulated by LPS. Two interferon regulatory factor (IRF) binding sites in the UBP43 promoter are important for the basal and LPS-induced levels of UBP43 expression. We show that IRF-3 (a transcription factor known to be involved in regulation of defensive responses) is responsible for LPS-induction ofUBP43, whereas IRF-2 mediates the basal level of expression. The murine macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7, was generously provided by Dr. M. Ostrowski (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) and was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 5% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 7% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in cell culture between 1 × 105 and 1 × 106 cells/ml. IRF-1/IRF-2 double knock-out murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generously provided by Dr. Janet Stein (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) with the permission from Dr. Tadatsugu Taniguchi and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. LPS (Escherichia coli serotype O127:B8) was purchased from Sigma. Total RNA from mouse brain and thymus tissues was prepared by the guanidine isothiocyanate extraction followed by cesium chloride gradient purification (22.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA from peritoneal macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells was isolated using RNazol B reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Ten μg of total RNA from each mouse tissue or time point was separated in an agarose/formaldehyde (0.22 m) gel, blotted on Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with either a full-length UBP43 cDNA (17.Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) or a full-length ISG15 cDNA (GenBank™ accession no.U58202) that has been amplified by PCR from mouse cytomegalovirus-infected cells. Rabbit polyclonal IgGs against human ISG15 were kindly provided by Dr. E. Borden (Cleveland Clinic Foundation) and were used at final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml (23.D'Cunha J. Ramanujam S. Wagner R.J. Witt P.L. Knight Jr., E. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4100-4108PubMed Google Scholar). The production of anti-UBP43 antibodies has been previously described (18.Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, anti-UBP43 antibodies were used at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted using standard procedures (24.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Generation of UBP43 knockout (UBP43−/−) mouse model in which UBP43 gene has been deleted by homologous recombination will be published elsewhere. 2K. Ritchie, M. Malakhov, C. Hetherington, L. Zhou, M.-T. Little, O. Malakhova, J. Sipe, and D.-E. Zhang, manuscript in preparation. Absence ofUBP43 expression in UBP43−/− mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-UBP43 antibodies as described above. RNase-protection assay was performed with a Riboquant™ kit (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled 284-nucleotide riboprobe extended from −197 to +71 of the murine UBP43 upstream region plus 16 nucleotides transcribed from pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ten μg of control yeast tRNA or 10 μg of total RNA isolated from mouse thymus or brain were used in each reaction. The murine UBP43 promoter was isolated from 129SV murine genomic DNA library (Stratagene). The isolated 3.5-kb promoter fragment including a part of the first exon was cloned into pBluescript II KS(−) and sequenced. The promoter was then subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pXP2 (25.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in p3KUBP43-luc. To generate a series of 5′-region deletions, p3KUBP43-luc was digested with HindIII/SpeI,HindIII/NheI, orHindIII/HindIII, blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and re-ligated. The resulting plasmids (p1.5KUBP43-luc, p0.7KUBP43-luc, and p0.1KUBP43-luc) were named by indicating the length of 5′-flanking region in each construct, respectively. To create p0.2KUBP43-luc, 240 bp of the UBP43 promoter was amplified by PCR using 5′-gtgtcctggtctagacgactggactg-3′ and 5′-gcgaagaccgagctccatctgcaaag-3′ as the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. The PCR product was sequenced and then inserted into pXP2. Mutant constructs p0.7KUBP43 (IRFE1m)-luc, p0.7KUBP43 (IRFE2m)-luc, and p0.7KUBP43 (IRFE1/2m)-luc were created by PCR-based mutagenesis with oligonucleotide pairs of an upstream primer (5′-acatctgtaaggatccagcaagcattt-3′) and one of three downstream primers (5′-gtccaagcttaagttttcc-3′ (IRFE1m), 5′-gtccaagctttcgttttcccctagatccaaagggcagcgagactcaggc-3′ (IRFE2m), or 5′-gtccaagcttaagttttcccctagatccaaagggcagcgagactcaggc-3′ (IRFE1/2m)) using the wild-type promoter as a template. They were then sequenced and inserted into the BamHI/HindIII sites of p0.1KUBP43-luc. Expression constructs for IRF-1 (pCMVIRF1) and IRF-2 (pCMVIRF2) were generously provided by Dr. Alan McLachlan (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) with the permission of Dr. John Hiscott (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), and the dominant-negative IRF-3 expression construct was generously provided by Dr. Michael David (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Transfection of RAW 264.7 cells was performed by electroporation (260 V, 975 microfarads) using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) equipped with a capacitance extender. UBP43-luc constructs (1 pmol/transfection) and an internal control for transfection efficiency, the promoterless Renilla luciferase expression construct, pRL-null (0.03 pmol/transfection), were co-transfected into 2.5 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml of complete RPMI in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad). The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 7 μg with pBluescript II KS(−). Cells from three electroporations were pooled together to eliminate differences between individual transfections. The mixture was then equally divided into three wells of a six-well plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). They were next allowed to adhere for 2 h before the medium was changed. Cells were harvested 48 h after electroporation and assayed for luciferase activity. For LPS treatment, cells were cultured in fresh medium for 36 h after electroporation. LPS (1 μg/ml) was added for 7 h, and cells were then lysed and assayed for firefly andRenilla luciferase activities with the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD PharMingen). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized based onRenilla luciferase activity. All data were reported as a mean -fold induction, which was calculated by dividing the normalized reporter activity of each stimulated sample by that of the corresponding unstimulated control sample. From the mean values of three independent experiments, the overall (average) mean and its standard deviation were presented. When the effect of IRF-1 and IRF-2 on UBP43 promoter activity was studied, 0.5 μg of the respective expression construct was co-transfected with 2 μg of either p0.7KUBP43-luc or p0.7KUBP43 (IRFE1/2m)-luc into IRF-1−/−IRF-2−/− double knock-out MEFs. Transfection of MEFs was performed using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dose-dependent inhibitory action of dominant-negative IRF-3 mutant was analyzed in RAW264.7 cells by co-transfection of wild-type (p0.7KUBP43-luc) or mutated version (p0.7KUBP43(IRFE1/2m)-luc) ofUBP43 promoter (1 pmol/transfection) and dominant-negative mutant of IRF-3 (ΔnIRF-3) (0.3, 0.5, and 1 pmol/transfection, respectively). Nuclear extracts were prepared by a previously described method (26.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclear proteins were extracted from unstimulated cells and from cells stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for seven h. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. Pellets from 1–5 × 107 cells were resuspended in 400 μl of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCI, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml chymostatin). After incubation on ice for 5–15 min, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and lysates were vortexed for 10 min. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 150 μl of Buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, and protease inhibitors as in Buffer A) and incubated for 15 min on ice with occasional shaking. The nuclear lysates were cleared by centrifugation, frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on polyacrylamide gels. EMSA reactions were performed in 20 μl of EMSA buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, and 100 ng/μl poly d(I-C). Ten μg of nuclear extracts were incubated in EMSA buffer with 1 μl of labeled oligonucleotide (5000–10,000 cpm; 5–10 fmol) for 20 min at room temperature. In competition analysis, 1 μl of unlabeled competitors (1 pmol) were added to the reaction mixtures. For supershift analysis, 2 μg of respective antibodies (anti-IRF-l (M-20), anti-IRF-2 (C-19), anti-p48/ISGF3γ (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-IRF-3 (Ref. 27.Navarro L. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35535-35538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) were incubated with the extract in EMSA buffer for 10 min at room temperature before the labeled oligonucleotide was added. The EMSA reactions were separated on 7% or 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 2 h at 50 V. The gels were vacuum dried, and the signals were detected by autoradiography. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of UBP43 in macrophages, we characterized the effect of LPS on UBP43 expression. As shown by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 A), the level ofUBP43 mRNA was significantly increased in thymi and macrophages of LPS-challenged mice. When RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells were stimulated with LPS, an increase of UBP43mRNA was detectable 2 h after stimulation, reaching a maximum expression at ∼10 h (Fig. 1 B). As expected, peritoneal macrophages as well as RAW 264.7 cells showed a significant up-regulation of ISG15 mRNA in response to LPS (Fig. 1,A and B). As indicated on the Western blot (Fig. 1 C), up-regulation of UBP43 expression on the transcriptional level was paralleled by changes in the level of UBP43 protein in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells showed very low level of UBP43 protein; however, LPS treatment led to a significant increase in the production of UBP43 protein. These results indicate that LPS signaling strongly increases the expression ofUBP43. To identify biochemical changes related toUBP43 expression in control and LPS-stimulated macrophages, we analyzed the overall protein ISG15ylation status in extracts from wild-type (UBP43 +/+) and UBP43-deficient (UBP43 −/−) cells. Although ISG15 conjugates were undetectable in normal (wild-type macrophages, not treated with LPS) peritoneal exudate macrophages, LPS treatment resulted in a substantial increase of intracellular ISG15 conjugates (Fig. 2, first and third lanes from left). Significantly, the absence of UBP43 in UBP43-deficient macrophages led to an increase in total cell protein ISG15ylation even without LPS treatment (Fig. 2, second lanefrom left). Upon LPS stimulation,UBP43 −/− macrophages showed substantially higher levels of conjugates when compared with that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2, fourth lane from left). These data suggest that UBP43 is essential in the regulation of the level of ISG15 conjugates in control and LPS-treated macrophages. To further study the molecular mechanism of UBP43activation by LPS, a 3.5-kb fragment containing the 5′-flanking region and part of the first exon of UBP43 was isolated by screening a murine genomic library using UBP43 cDNA as a probe. The sequence of this 3.5 kb has been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number: AF388669. To identify the transcription initiation site of UBP43, RNase protection assays were performed. The riboprobe was 284 nucleotides long and contained 268 nucleotides that correlated to UBP43 DNA sequence from bp −197 to +71. When this probe was hybridized to total RNA prepared from the thymus of LPS-treated mice and digested with ribonucleases, it generated a major band and three minor bands. Such protected bands were not detectable when brain RNA or yeast tRNA were used as negative controls (Fig. 3). With the calculation based on the molecular weight marker, the results demonstrated that the major UBP43 transcription initiation site is 111 bp upstream of the 3′-end of exon 1 (Fig. 4 A). No TATA box was identified around the transcription initiation site of theUBP43 gene. However, there are two GC box consensus sequences in the nearest upstream region.Figure 4Sequence and deletion analysis ofUBP43 promoter. A, sequence (200 bp) of the UBP43 proximal promoter region and part of the 5′-untranslated region of the UBP43 gene is presented. The major transcription initiation site is marked with an arrowand numbered as +1. Potential IRFE sites are shown in bold. GC boxes are underlined. The translation start codon ofUBP43 is shown in italic bold. These sequence data are available from GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AF388669. B, LPS induction of UBP43 promoter. Schematic representations of UBP43 promoter-luciferase constructs are shown on the left. These constructs and the promoterless pXP2 vector were transfected into RAW 264.7 cells. The number in the name of each construct indicates the length of the 5′-flanking region of UBP43 included in the construct. Half of the transfected cells were treated with LPS for 7 h, and the other half were cultured under normal conditions. The cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are expressed as -fold increase in relative luciferase activity in LPS-stimulated cells over the untreated cells. The data represent the mean -fold of induction of three independent experiments ± S.D. of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the isolated 3.5 kb upstream sequence of the UBP43 gene confers inducibility by LPS, we made a luciferase-reporter construct, in which the 3.5-kb upstream sequence ofUBP43 was inserted into promoterless luciferase reporter, pXP2, to form p3KUBP43-luc. Promoter activity was readily detectable when p3KUBP43-luc was transfected into RAW 264.7 cells. The luciferase activity of p3KUBP43-luc was ∼200-fold greater than the promoterless pXP2 construct (data not shown), indicating a strong promoter activity of this fragment. Upon LPS treatment, p3KUBP43-luc showed a 5-fold increase in promoter activity (Fig. 4 B). To identify the region in the UBP43 promoter that is critical for LPS response, a series of deletion constructs were created and their activities were examined using transient transfection assays in RAW264.7 cells. Deletion of the UBP43 promoter to −200 bp (p0.2KUBP43-luc) did not significantly reduce LPS-inducedUBP43 promoter activity. A further deletion of the promoter to −100 bp (p0.1KUBP43-luc) completely abolished LPS induction of the reporter gene (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the LPS response element of the UBP43 promoter is located between bp −200 and bp −100. To identify the regulatory elements in the promoter of UBP43 responsible for LPS induction, we first examined the proximal 200-bp sequence of the UBP43 promoter using the TRANSFAC database (transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC/). Two putative IRF binding sites were identified. They were designated as IRFE-1 and IRFE-2 (Fig. 4 A). Both sites were located between the bp −95 to −130 region of the UBP43 promoter. The sequence of the IRFE-1 site (bp −95 to −104) closely resembles the IRFE (28.Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The second site IRFE-2 (bp −118 to −130) is closely related to the interferon-stimulated response element (29.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). To delineate whether the IRFE-1 and IRFE-2 sites were important for regulation of theUBP43 promoter in RAW 264.7 cells, point mutations were introduced at either the IRFE-1 or IRFE-2 site, or at both sites of theUBP43 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (p0.7KUBP43-luc) to disrupt the consensus binding sites of the respective elements (Fig. 5 A). Transfection analysis of IRFE-mutated promoter constructs into RAW 264.7 cells demonstrated that these mutations affected theUBP43 basal promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). Mutation at either one of the two IRFEs alone decreased the promoter activity to 50% of the activity in the control. Mutation at both sites together decreased the promoter activity to 12% of the control level, indicating that these two IRFEs are important for the basalUBP43 promoter activity. We also studied the effect of these mutations on LPS-induced UBP43 promoter activity. Loss of IRFE-1 in the UBP43 promoter (p0.7KUBP43(IRFE1m)-luc) caused only a slight decrease of LPS induced promoter activation, whereas mutation of the IRFE-2 site (p0.7KUBP43(IRFE2m)-luc) decreased promoter inducibility to 48% of the control (Fig. 5 C). When both sites were mutated simultaneously (p0.7KUBP43(IRFE1/2m)-luc), it essentially abolished the response to LPS, reducing the inducible promoter activity to the level of the control vector alone (pXP2). These data indicate that an intact IRFE region is required for LPS induction of UBP43 gene expression as well as for its basal promoter activity in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, the IRFE-2 site is more capable of mediating LPS inducibility of the UBP43promoter. Nevertheless, both cis-acting elements were required to provide optimal responsiveness to LPS. The transfection experiments showed that IRFE-1 and IRFE-2 are functional elements for both constitutive and LPS-inducedUBP43 promoter activity in macrophages. To identify the transcription factors interacting with these IRFEs, double-stranded oligonucleotides encompassing IRFE-1 and IRFE-2 sites were synthesized as shown in Fig. 5 A. When incubated with nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS, both IRFE probes displayed similar binding patterns in EMSA (Fig. 6 A).

Toxin binding to spheroplasts is mediated by Kre1p, a cell wall protein initially attached to the plasma membrane by its C-terminal GPI anchor. Kre1p binds toxin directly. Both cells and spheroplasts of Deltakre1 mutants are completely toxin resistant; binding to cell walls and spheroplasts is reduced to 10% and < 0.5%, respectively. Expression of K28-Kre1p, an inactive C-terminal fragment of Kre1p retaining its toxin affinity and membrane anchor, fully restored toxin binding and sensitivity to spheroplasts, while intact cells remained resistant. Kre1p is apparently the toxin membrane receptor required for subsequent lethal ion channel formation."
https://openalex.org/W1973447588,"Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. Two forms of PLTP exist in human plasma, one catalytically active (high activity form, HA-PLTP) and the other inactive (low activity form, LA-PLTP) (Oka, T., Kujiraoka, T., Ito, M., Egashira, T., Takahashi, S., Nanjee, N. M., Miller, N. E., Metso, J., Olkkonen, V. M., Ehnholm, C., Jauhiainen, M., and Hattori, H. (2000) J. Lipid Res. 41, 1651–1657). The two forms are associated with macromolecular complexes of different size. The apparent size of LA-PLTP is 520 kDa and that of HA-PLTP is 160 kDa. Of the circulating PLTP mass only a minor portion is in the HA-PLTP form in normolipidemic subjects. In the present study we have isolated and partially characterized the LA and HA forms of PLTP. Both LA- and HA-PLTP bind to heparin-Sepharose and can be separated by elution with 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient, with HA-PLTP displaying higher affinity for the matrix. LA-PLTP was further purified using hydrophobic butyl-Sepharose and anti-PLTP immunoaffinity chromatography steps. HA-PLTP was subjected to a second heparin-Sepharose step and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Analysis of the two forms of PLTP by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and gel filtration demonstrates that LA-PLTP is complexed with apoA-I whereas HA-PLTP is not. Instead, HA-PLTP copurified with apoE. Based on these findings we suggest a model in which nascent PLTP enters the circulation as a high specific activity form not associated with apoA-I. During or after the transfer of lipolytic surface remnants to HDL, PLTP is transferred to apoA-I-containing HDL particles and thereby becomes part of the low activity complex.

The ability of HDL to protect against atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is well documented, and although the exact molecular mechanism(s) behind this finding is still unsolved, it is thought to be due to the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport (6Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HDL in human plasma consist of several subpopulations of particles of distinct structure, function, and composition. This heterogeneity, which is the result of continuous remodeling of HDL by plasma factors, has important implications in terms of the cardioprotective functions of HDL (7Rye K.-A. Clay M.A. Barter P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 145: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) plays an essential role in the metabolism of HDL. Its role in the transfer of surface remnants from triglyceride-rich particles, very low density lipoproteins, and chylomicrons, to HDL during lipolysis is of importance for the maintenance of HDL levels (8Huuskonen J.

We recently reported the presence of two forms of PLTP in plasma (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one catalytically active and the other inactive. Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrates that these two forms are associated with macromolecular complexes of different size: the active PLTP elutes in the position of large HDL particles, and the inactive PLTP elutes between HDL and low density lipoprotein. To gain insight into the regulation of the different forms of PLTP in the context of lipoprotein metabolism and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the generation of these two PLTP populations we decided to isolate and characterize the active and inactive forms of plasma PLTP. We now report that the inactive and active forms of PLTP can be separated using heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and that they can be further purified by hydrophobic chromatography and anti-PLTP immunoaffinity chromatography. Using immunoprecipitation with anti-PLTP and anti-apoA-I antibodies we demonstrate that the inactive form of PLTP is complexed with apoA-I whereas the active form copurifies with apoE. Normolipidemic human plasma was obtained by plasmapheresis. The protease inhibitors Trasylol, 50 units/ml; dichloroisocoumarin (DCIC), 0.4 mm; E-64, 1 mm; 3-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF), 1 mm, and leupeptin, 10 μm, were immediately added to the plasma. PLTP activity was measured using the radiometric assay described by Damen et al. (14Damen J. Regts J. Scherphof G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (11Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Pahlman R. Blomqvist S. van Tol A. Ehnholm C. J. Biol.

Total serum cholesterol (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany, catalog no. 1489232), serum triglycerides (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany, catalog no. 1488872), phospholipids (WAKO Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany, phospholipids B, code 990–54009), and free cholesterol (WAKO Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany, code 274-47109) were measured using commercial kits. Cholesterol esters were calculated by subtracting the free cholesterol from the total cholesterol value. Lipoprotein profiles were obtained by size-exclusion chromatography using two HR 10/30 Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration columns in tandem. Elution of lipoproteins was carried out using 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (PBS). Elution was performed at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The monoclonal antibody JH66 against PLTP was produced and isolated as previously described (15Huuskonen J. Ekström M. Tahvanainen E. Vainio A. Metso J. Pussinen P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V. Jauhiainen M. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 151: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As judged from a molecular model (17Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the epitope region of this antibody is located on the surface of PLTP and well exposed. Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant human PLTP (rhPLTP) and apoA-I were raised in New Zealand White rabbits. In brief, 250 μg of purified rhPLTP or apoA-I in PBS suspended in Freund’s complete adjuvant was injected into rabbits subcutaneously. The rabbits subsequently received three booster injections at 2-week intervals. Polyclonal antibodies against rhPLTP and apoA-I were purified from rabbit serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Protein A-Sepharose chromatography. The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (data not shown). SDS-PAGE was performed by the Laemmli method (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1979; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), followed by Coomassie staining or Western blotting and ECL detection (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 76: 4350-4357Crossref Scopus (44922) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography was performed using a 250-ml heparin-Sepharose 6 Fast-Flow column (column dimensions, 4.5 × 12 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA. Fresh human plasma (50 ml) was applied and recycled on the column overnight at +4 °C with a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The column was washed with the same buffer, flow rate of 10 ml/min, and thereafter the bound material was eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 5 ml/min; 10-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for PLTP activity and mass. The active PLTP fractions (high activity (HA)-PLTP) recovered from the 250-ml H-S column were combined and dialyzed against 25 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and then applied to a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.1 mNaCl, flow rate of 2 ml/min. The bound material was eluted with a linear 0.1–1 m NaCl gradient (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; fraction size, 2.5 ml). The fractions were analyzed for PLTP activity and mass. The inactive PLTP fractions (low activity (LA)-PLTP) recovered from the 250-ml H-S column were combined and adjusted with NaCl to a final concentration of 2 m. The LA-PLTP was applied to a 2 × 5-cm butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmEDTA and eluted with 50% (v/v) ethanol. The fraction size was 4 ml. The monoclonal anti-PLTP-antibody JH66 (21Huuskonen J. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (17.8 mg of IgG/3 ml of gel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The LA-PLTP fractions from the butyl-Sepharose column were dialyzed against PBS and applied on the anti-PLTP column (1 × 3 cm) equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed in two steps: first with PBS and then with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, and 2.5-ml fractions were collected. The material bound to the antibody column was eluted with 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5, containing 0.2% Tween 20 into tubes containing 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for neutralization. The elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The HA-PLTP fractions from the small scale H-S chromatography were combined and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad, column dimensions, 1.3 × 2 cm) equilibrated with 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 150 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein bound to the column was eluted with a linear 1–50 mm sodium phosphate gradient followed by 100 mmphosphate, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Immunoglobulins (100 μg) isolated from anti-rhPLTP, anti-apoA-I, or control rabbit serum were coupled to Protein G-Sepharose (50 μg) (Amersham Biosciences). After the beads were washed, 50 μl of the PLTP samples or 5 μl of serum were added and incubated on ice in a total volume of 500 μl for 16 h. After incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and PLTP mass and activity were determined from the supernatants. In addition, immunoprecipitation of the LA-PLTP and HA-PLTP was performed using Dynabeads Protein G magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The buffer used in the experiments was PBS, pH 7.4. Briefly, anti-PLTP mAb JH66, rabbit polyclonal anti-apoA-I, or a non-immune IgG was added to washed Dynabeads (250 μl) and incubated with gentle mixing for 40 min at room temperature, after which the beads were washed two times with 500 μl of PBS. Covalent immobilization of the bound IgG was then carried using dimethyl pimelimidate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The LA-PLTP and the HA-PLTP samples were added to the beads and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle mixing. The beads were recovered, and the supernatant was used for determinations. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and then treated with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and after neutralization the eluted material was used for analyses. We have demonstrated that PLTP in human plasma exists in two forms, one with low (LA-PLTP) and the other with high specific activity (HA-PLTP), and that these can be separated by size-exclusion chromatography (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study the two forms of plasma PLTP were separated by H-S affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). When plasma was applied to the H-S column, 93 ± 5% (n = 3) of the PLTP activity and 70 ± 15% (n = 3) of the PLTP mass applied were bound to the matrix. The PLTP mass and activity retained in the column were eluted with a linear 0–0.5 mNaCl gradient. The low activity form of PLTP eluted at a NaCl concentration of 0.15–0.2 m, and the high activity form at 0.3–0.4 m NaCl. The total recovery of PLTP activity in this step was 110 ± 16% (n = 3) and that of PLTP mass was 90 ± 21% (n = 3). The specific activity of the LA-PLTP after H-S affinity chromatography (Fig. 1, fractions 78–81) was 0.04 μmol/h/μg whereas that of the HA-PLTP (fractions 92–118) was 3.5 μmol/h/μg, as compared with 0.36 ± 0.22 μmol/h/μg in whole plasma (15Huuskonen J.

As this purification step does not allow a complete separation of the two forms of PLTP the specific activities of the combined fractions of LA-PLTP and HA-PLTP must be regarded as tentative. Taken together, the two forms of PLTP, HA-PLTP and LA-PLTP, both bind to heparin and can be efficiently resolved by elution with a linear NaCl gradient. To verify that the LA- and HA-PLTP resolved by H-S affinity chromatography correspond to those described previously (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two fractions were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2). The elution volumes of the two PLTP populations (Fig. 2, A and B) were similar to those obtained for LA-PLTP and HA-PLTP when whole plasma was chromatographed under identical conditions (Fig. 2C). LA-PLTP and HA-PLTP eluted at positions corresponding to average molecular masses of about 520 kDa and 160 kDa, respectively. Thus, separation of LA- and HA-PLTP by H-S affinity chromatography does not disturb the integrity of the native PLTP complexes. To further enrich the LA-PLTP separated from the HA-PLTP by H-S affinity chromatography, the fractions containing LA-PLTP were subjected to hydrophobic chromatography on butyl-Sepharose (Fig. 3). Of the LA-PLTP mass applied, 100% was retained in the column, and 79% could be eluted with 50% EtOH. More than 90% of the protein eluted was apoA-I. To analyze whether the LA-PLTP complex obtained by this step is of the same size as LA-PLTP isolated from plasma by gel filtration, the complex was subjected to gel filtration. It eluted in a position corresponding to an approximated molecular mass of 520 kDa, indicating that the conditions used in the hydrophobic chromatography step had not dissociated the complex. When gel filtration analysis of this LA-PLTP fraction was performed in the presence of 8 m urea, the PLTP protein eluted in a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 160 kDa (Fig. 4). These data suggest that LA-PLTP is part of a large protein complex that can be dissociated with a high concentration of urea.Figure 4Size-exclusion chromatography of LA-PLTP and HA-PLTP. The size of the LA-PLTP and HA-PLTP complexes was analyzed from different purification steps by size-exclusion chromatography on Superose 6HR. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed for PLTP mass (LA-PLTP) or PLTP activity (HA-PLTP). Elution was performed in the presence (↓) or absence of 8 m urea (↓). The samples were as follows: 1, LA-PLTP isolated by gel filtration of plasma; 2, LA-PLTP following the heparin-Sepharose chromatography; 3, LA-PLTP following the butyl-Sepharose chromatography; 4, LA-PLTP following the anti-PLTP JH66 chromatography; 5, HA-PLTP isolated by gel filtration of plasma; 6, HA-PLTP from the heparin-Sepharose chromatography; 7, HA-PLTP from the hydroxylapatite chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The LA-PLTP obtained by hydrophobic chromatography was then subjected to chromatography on an immunoaffinity column prepared from the monoclonal anti-PLTP antibody JH 66 (Fig. 5). Of the LA-PLTP applied, 85% was retained by the column and could be eluted by 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5, containing 0.2% Tween 20. In this purification step the apparent size of the LA-PLTP complex changed significantly. The LA-PLTP recovered had a molecular mass of 160 kDa as assessed by gel filtration (Fig. 4). Although the size of LA-PLTP after this step was similar to that determined for HA-PLTP (see below), no phospholipid transfer activity could be detected in the eluted fractions (data not shown). Most of the apoA-I did not bind to the affinity matrix. However, a significant amount of apoA-I was detected in the eluted LA-PLTP fractions. In the presence of 8 m urea the apparent mass of the 160-kDa mAb column LA-PLTP complex remained unchanged. SDS-PAGE analysis of the LA-PLTP fraction obtained by Ab-affinity chromatography and gel filtration (Fig. 6) revealed a protein pattern composed of the 80-kDa PLTP identified by Western blotting, and additional protein bands with the apparent molecular masses of 48, 40, and 28 kDa. Of these, the 28-kDa protein was identified as apoA-I. In the LA-PLTP fraction no apoE could be detected. To further enrich the HA-PLTP separated from the LA-PLTP by H-S affinity chromatography, the fractions containing HA-PLTP (Fig. 1, fractions 90–120) were subjected to a second H-S affinity chromatography (Fig. 7). Of the PLTP activity applied 73% was recovered when the column was eluted with a linear 0.1–1.0m NaCl gradient. The apoA-I bound to the matrix eluted immediately before PLTP, whereas the elution position of apoE coincided with that of PLTP. The fractions (Fig. 7, fractions 36–40) containing PLTP activity were then combined and subjected to chromatography on hydroxylapatite (Fig. 8). The column was developed using a linear 1–50 mm sodium phosphate gradient followed by 100 mm sodium phosphate. In this step 36% of the PLTP activity and 91% of PLTP mass were recovered in fractions 19–23. The fractions contained apoE but no apoA-I. The majority of the bound apoE and apoA-I was recovered in the 100 mm phosphate eluate. When the eluted fractions containing HA-PLTP were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography, PLTP activity and mass eluted in a position corresponding to the size 160 kDa, together with apoE (Fig. 9).Figure 8Hydroxylapatite chromatography of HA-PLTP. HA-PLTP fractions recovered from H-S affinity chromatography (fractions 35–40, Fig. 5) were combined and subjected to hydroxylapatite chromatography. The protein bound to the column was eluted with a linear 1–50 mm sodium phosphate gradient followed by 100 mm phosphate. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected.

Of these, a 34-kDa band was identified as apoE. The identity and possible association of the other proteins with PLTP are under study. Previous work has suggested that PLTP is capable of associating with apolipoproteins in vitro(22Pussinen P.J. Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Pyle L.E. Marcel Y.L. Fidge N.H. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 152-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (23Barlage S. Fröhlich D. Böttcher A. Jauhiainen M. Müller H.P. Noetzel F. Rothe G. Schütt C. Linke R.P. Lackner K.J. Ehnholm C. Schmitz G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the association of PLTP with the major apolipoprotein of HDL, apoA-I, immunoprecipitations of plasma and HA- and LA-PLTP fractions obtained by size-exclusion chromatography were performed. Immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-PLTP removed about 95% of the PLTP mass from plasma and from the LA- and HA-PLTP fractions, as well as from recombinant human PLTP included as a control. Similarly, PLTP activity was efficiently removed from plasma and from the HA-PLTP fraction (Fig. 10). Non-immune rabbit IgG did not significantly precipitate PLTP protein nor did it remove PLTP activity from the specimens. Immunoprecipitation of plasma using anti-apoA-I antibodies resulted in coprecipitation of 80% of the PLTP protein. However, anti-apoA-I precipitation only caused a minor 5% decrease in plasma PLTP activity. Anti-apoA-I, when added to the LA-PLTP fraction, caused coprecipitation of 90% of the PLTP protein, indicating that apoA-I and PLTP form a physical complex. Immunoprecipitation of the HA-PLTP fraction with anti-apoA-I resulted in only a marginal 3% decrease of the PLTP activity, suggesting that the active form of PLTP is not associated with apoA-I-containing particles. Similar results were obtained when the LA-PLTP fraction obtained from the mAb JH66 immunoaffinity column and the HA-PLTP from the hydroxylapatite column were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the same antibodies (data not shown). Although the knowledge on the structure and in vitrofunctions of PLTP have substantially increased during recent years (8Huuskonen J. Ehnholm C. Curr. Opin.

These studies clearly demonstrate that PLTP plays an essential role in maintaining HDL levels in the context of lipolysis and participates in the removal of cholesterol from macrophages by generating pre-β-HDL particles. Studies on the physiological role of PLTP have been hampered by the lack of an assay for PLTP mass measurement. The development of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays for PLTP protein measurement (15Huuskonen J. Ekström M. Tahvanainen E. Vainio A. Metso J. Pussinen P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V. Jauhiainen M.

We recently reported that PLTP mass and activity in human plasma do not correlate (15Huuskonen J. Ekström M. Tahvanainen E. Vainio A. Metso J. Pussinen P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V. Jauhiainen M. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 151: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that there are two forms of PLTP in the circulation, one with very low (LA-PLTP) and the other with high specific activity (HA-PLTP) (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding raises the question of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the distribution of PLTP between the two forms. Such mechanisms are likely to be of great importance in the metabolism of HDL as well as of apoB-containing lipoproteins (28Jiang X.-C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that PLTP activity can be separated from cholesterol ester transfer protein activity using H-S affinity chromatography (11Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Pahlman R. Blomqvist S. van Tol A. Ehnholm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4032-4036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tall A.R. Abreu E. Shuman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that H-S affinity chromatography can also be used to separate the two forms of PLTP, HA-PLTP and LA-PLTP. More than 90% of plasma PLTP activity and 70% of the PLTP mass were retained by the heparin column. LA- and HA-PLTP fractions could then be separated by elution with a salt gradient. Less than 5% of the total PLTP mass recovered was present in the HA-PLTP fractions. This provides additional support for the notion that only a small fraction of the plasma PLTP protein is responsible for the PLTP activity detected in human plasma and that it expresses a very high specific activity (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two forms of PLTP have different heparin binding affinities. PLTP has been suggested to contain a heparin binding domain (29Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, the low affinity binding of LA-PLTP to the heparin matrix could be mediated directly by this domain. On the other hand, the higher affinity of HA-PLTP could be due to the contribution of other proteins showing affinity for heparin. Alternatively, conformational differences between the two forms of PLTP could cause the difference in heparin binding affinity. LA-PLTP, when fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, elutes according to a molecular size of 520 kDa. A similar size of the LA-PLTP is also evident in non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the LA-PLTP complex was chromatographed in the presence of 8m urea, it dissociated, and the PLTP mass eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 160 kDa. These data suggest that the low activity form of PLTP is part of a relatively large protein complex that is sensitive to dissociation under chaotropic conditions. The complex could in principle represent a homomultimer of PLTP or a complex of PLTP with other plasma proteins and lipids. Interestingly, the present data provide evidence that PLTP in the low activity complex is physically associated with apoA-I. The observation that HDL isolated by ultracentrifugation contains a large proportion of plasma PLTP mass, up to 40%, but only a marginal portion of plasma PLTP activity (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is in agreement with the present finding that PLTP associated with apoA-I is of low specific activity. The 520-kDa LA-PLTP complex remained intact during the heparin and butyl-Sepharose chromatography steps, but its size decreased in the immunoaffinity purification. It is possible that binding of LA-PLTP to the specific antibody detached a PLTP·apoA-I subcomplex, which may have originally been associated, for example, with HDL-like structures that did not bind to the antibody column. In size-exclusion chromatography the catalytically active HA-PLTP has an apparent size of 160 kDa (13Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Ito M. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee N.M. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HA-PLTP eluted in a similar position both in the presence and absence of 8 m urea, suggesting that it might represent a PLTP dimer, PLTP associated with lipids, or a urea-resistant relatively small protein complex. PLTP activity either in plasma or in the isolated HA-PLTP fraction could not be coimmunoprecipitated with apoA-I. However, HA-PLTP was found to copurify with apoE. In agreement with this finding, it was recently reported that PLTP activity increases significantly during inflammation, and in this situation active PLTP showed a major overlap with apoE upon analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (23Barlage S. Fröhlich D. Böttcher A. Jauhiainen M. Müller H.P. Noetzel F. Rothe G. Schütt C. Linke R.P. Lackner K.J. Ehnholm C. Schmitz G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently reported that PLTP plays a role in the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (28Jiang X.-C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, PLTP may initially be part of the secreted nascent VLDL or related particles. The finding that LA-PLTP but not HA-PLTP is associated with apoA-I allows us to suggest a model in which nascent PLTP enters the circulation as a high specific activity form not associated with HDL. During or after the transfer of lipolytic surface remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to HDL, an important function of PLTP (10Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Ji M. Lin Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), the PLTP or part of it may become associated with apoA-I-containing HDL-like particles and in this way be sequestered into the LA-PLTP complex. Whether this process is irreversible and how the plasma lipoprotein profile/lipid composition might affect the balance between the LA- and HA-PLTP populations are topics of future studies. Our previous finding that the activity of PLTP in human plasma shows positive correlation with triglyceride concentration and negative with HDL-C and apoA-I concentration (15Huuskonen J. Ekström M. Tahvanainen E. Vainio A. Metso J. Pussinen P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V. Jauhiainen M. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 151: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), would be consistent with a model in which predominance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins favors the maintenance of PLTP in the HA form and abundance of HDL favors the conversion of PLTP into the LA form. Although the LA-PLTP displays almost no phospholipid transfer activity, it may have other physiologically important functions in the circulation or locally in tissues (see Ref. 30Jiang X.C. D'Armiento J. Mallampalli R.K. Mar J. Yan S.F. Lin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15714-15718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It seems unlikely that such a complex representing more than 90% of the total plasma PLTP mass could be nothing but an intermediate directed to the catabolic route. To understand the physiological implications of the distribution of PLTP between the two forms, it is now necessary to clarify the mechanisms of PLTP inactivation/activation and the tentative function(s) of LA-PLTP.

The Glu373-Ala374 site is cleavedin vitro by aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS4) and aggrecanase-2 (ADAMTS5), whereas the other site, at Asn341-Phe342, is efficiently cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and by cathepsin B at low pH. Accordingly, the presence of the cleavage products globular domain 1 (G1)-NITEGE373 and G1-VDIPEN341in vivo has been widely interpreted as evidence for the specific involvement of ADAMTS enzymes and MMPs/cathepsin B, respectively, in aggrecan proteolysis in situ. We show here, in digests with native human aggrecan, that purified ADAMTS4 cleaves primarily at the Glu373-Ala374 site, but also, albeit slowly and secondarily, at the Asn341-Phe342 site. Cleavage at the Asn341-Phe342 site in these incubations was due to bona fide ADAMTS4 activity (and not a contaminating MMP) because the cleavage was inhibited by TIMP-3 (a potent inhibitor of ADAMTS4), but not by TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, at concentrations that totally blocked MMP-3-mediated cleavage at this site. Digestion of recombinant human G1-G2 (wild-type and cleavage site mutants) confirmed the dual activity of ADAMTS4 and supported the idea that the enzyme cleaves primarily at the Glu373-Ala374 site and secondarily generates G1-VDIPEN341 by removal of the Phe342–Glu373 peptide from G1-NITEGE373. These results show that G1-VDIPEN341 is a product of both MMP and ADAMTS4 activities and challenge the widely held assumption that this product represents a specific indicator of MMP- or cathepsin B-mediated aggrecan degradation.

Tech. 1994; 28: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have revealed that the molecular organization of aggrecan is perfectly suited to its central functional role in articular cartilage. The N-terminal region of aggrecan is composed of two globular domains (G11 and G2) separated by the interglobular domain (IGD). G1 interacts with hyaluronan and link protein, thereby keeping the aggrecan molecule anchored within the cartilage tissue. Further interactions with other matrix components such as tenascin-R and fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 (7Aspberg A. Adam S. Kostka G. Timpl R. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Olin A.I. Morgelin M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Heinegard D. Aspberg A. J. Biol.

The extended core protein between G2 and G3 is composed of a short keratan sulfate-rich region followed by a longer chondroitin sulfate-substituted domain. The charge repulsion and hydration of the long negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are thought to maintain the C-terminal portions of aggrecan in an extended conformation (9Morgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 50: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The swelling pressure of the aggrecan-link protein complex with hyaluronan is restrained by the tension in the collagen network; and together, these components form a fiber-reinforced concentrated gel within the cartilage, which transmits forces across the articular joint. In diseases characterized by cartilage degradation such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, increased aggrecan release from the cartilage occurs early (10Lark M.W. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J. Harper C.F. Hoerrner L.A. Hutchinson N.I. Singer I.I. Donatelli S.A. Weidner J.R. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin.

Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of aggrecan within the IGD separates the GAG-rich region from the hyaluronan-anchored G1 domain, resulting in GAG release from the cartilage matrix to the synovial fluid. Biomechanical tests on cartilage discs have shown that proteolysis within the IGD of aggrecan, and not cleavages near the C terminus, is primarily responsible for the loss of compressive resistance that accompanies interleukin-1-mediated degradation of the tissue (13Patwari P. Kurz B. Sandy J.D. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Identification of the proteinases responsible for this “destructive” cleavage of aggrecan has therefore been a major focus of experimentation in arthritis-related research. In this regard, two major cleavage sites that occur in vivohave been identified in the IGD of human aggrecan. One is a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive site at VDIPEN341↓F342FGVGG, which can be cleaved at neutral pH by any one of a range of MMPs, including MMP-1–3, -7–9, -13, -14, -19, and -20, and also by the combined endopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activity of cathepsin B at low pH (14Mort J.S. Magny M.C. Lee E.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments of aggrecan resulting from cleavage at this site have been isolated from normal articular tissue (10Lark M.W. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J. Harper C.F. Hoerrner L.A. Hutchinson N.I.

Products derived from cleavage at this site represent the bulk of aggrecan fragments found in cartilage and synovial fluids from normal and arthritis patients (10Lark M.W. Bayne E.K. Flanagan J.

J. 2001; 358: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and others (22Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R.

Arner E.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) have proposed that the ADAMTS proteinases are primarily responsible for the degradative removal of aggrecan from cartilage. Nonetheless, a review of the recent literature on this subject (Ref. 23Caterson B. Flannery C.R. Hughes C.E. Little C.B. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholarand references therein) shows that in many laboratories, there is a continuing debate over the importance of MMPs and ADAMTS enzymes in cartilage aggrecan degradation. Indeed, it has become widely accepted that immunodetection with specific anti-neoepitope antisera can provide reliable data on the relative role of MMPs or cathepsin B and ADAMTS enzymes in particular situations. Thus, the presence of products with anti-VDIPEN341 or anti-F342FGVGG antibody reactivity is taken as evidence for MMP/cathepsin B-dependent cleavage, whereas fragments that react with anti-NITEGE373 or anti-A374RGSVI antibody are taken as proof for the involvement of ADAMTS enzymes. In this study, we present data showing that incubation at neutral pH of mature human aggrecan with recombinant human ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1) results in a primary cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site and a secondary cleavage at the Asn341-Phe342 site. These results suggest that cleavage of aggrecan in vivo at Asn341-Phe342 may be due to MMPs, cathepsin B, or ADAMTS4 activity.

The purity of recombinant ADAMTS4 was established with a rabbit anti-human ADAMTS4 polyclonal antibody made against eight distinct synthetic peptides representing all domains of the protein. Poros HQ and Poros HS were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). All other chemicals used were purchased from Sigma. Human ADAMTS4 was isolated using a PCR strategy. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify overlapping portions of the 5′- and 3′-halves of the gene. Of the seven human multiple-tissue cDNA libraries that were used as PCR templates, only the uterus cDNA library resulted in PCR products of the appropriate size (5′-amplimer of 1293 bp and 3′-amplimer of 1420 bp). PCR-amplified fragments were digested withEcoRI and BamHI (5′-product) or BamHI and NotI (3′-product), ligated into EcoRI- andNotI-digested COS expression vector pED6-dpc2, and transformed into ElectroMAX DH10B cells (Invitrogen).

The 3′-primer set was 5′-CTCCAAGCCATGCATCAGTTTGAATG-3′ and 5′-GACTGACTGCGGCCGCATAGTGAGGTTATTTCCTGCCCGCC-3′ (this primer incorporated an 8-bp tail (GACTGACT) and a NotI site (GCGGCCGC) downstream of the TAA stop codon for ADAMTS4). The EcoRI-NotI fragment containing the intact ADAMTS4 coding sequence was subcloned into pHTop. This plasmid was derived from pED (26Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) by removing the majority of the adenovirus major late promoter and inserting six repeats of the tetoperator (27Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). A CHO cell line stably expressing ADAMTS4 was obtained by transfecting pHTop/ ADAMTS4 into CHO/A2 cells and selecting clones in 0.05 μm methotrexate. The CHO/A2 cell line was derived from CHO DUKX B11 cells (28Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) by stably integrating a transcriptional activator, a fusion between the tet repressor and the herpesvirus VP16 transcription activation domain (27Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The CHO cell-conditioned medium was harvested and diluted 3-fold with buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm ZnCl2) and applied to a 50 μ Poros HQ column. The column was washed with buffer B (20 mmTris (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 10 μm ZnCl2), and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B containing 50 mm to 1.0 m NaCl. The ADAMTS4-containing fraction was further purified by application to a 50 μ Poros HS column after a 10-fold dilution with buffer C (20 mmTris (pH 6.8), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 10 μm ZnCl2), and the column was washed with 10 column volumes. Protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of buffer C containing 50 mmto 1.0 m NaCl, and the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm was used for protein concentration determination as outlined by Gill and von Hippel (29Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). To analyze the sites cleaved within human aggrecan, ADAMTS4 or MMP-3 at varying concentrations was incubated with normal mature human aggrecan at 37 °C in digestion buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2). Digests were then deglycosylated in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mm EDTA with chondroitinase ABC (25 milliunits/100 μg of GAG, protease-free) for 1.5 h at 37 °C, followed by endo-β-galactosidase (0.5 milliunits/100 μg of GAG) and keratanase II (0.5 milliunits/100 μg of GAG) for 2 h at 37 °C. The samples were dried, and 5 μg of digested aggrecan (based on dry weight) was loaded per lane on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis with chemiluminescent detection as described (18Sandy J.D. Verscharen C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). TIMP-1, TIMP-2, EDTA, and an inhibitor mixture (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 250 nm TIMP-1) were incubated with the enzymes for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of human aggrecan substrate (200 nm, calculated based on a molecular mass of 1000 kDa) and further incubation for 16 h at 37 °C in digestion buffer. Specifically, ADAMTS4 (54 nm) or MMP-3 (44 nm) was incubated with TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 at 125, 250, or 750 nm. For incubations containing EDTA (10 mm) or the inhibitor mixture, the inhibitor was added to ADAMTS4 (109 nm). TIMP-3 (125 nm) was added to ADAMTS4 (100 nm, preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C), and the mixture was incubated for a further 2 h before the addition of the aggrecan substrate (200 nm). All digests were deglycosylated as described above and analyzed by Western analysis at 5 μg of digested aggrecan (based on dry weight) loaded per lane. Recombinant G1 (rG1)-G2 substrates (wild-type, an aggrecanase site mutant (A374RGSV to N374VYSV), or an MMP site mutant (deletion of residues EN341↓F342F)) were expressed and purified as described previously (30Mercuri F.A.

Last K. Fosang A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33038-33045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For digests, ADAMTS4 (381 nm) was incubated with the rG1-G2 substrate (1.4 μm) in digestion buffer at 37 °C for 16 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA. The samples were then dried, run on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis. Recombinant human ADAMTS4 was expressed and purified by gradient elution from sequential anion-exchange (Poros HQ) and cation-exchange (Poros HS) chromatography supports (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The major silver-stained protein isolated by this protocol migrated at ∼70 kDa and corresponded to the major anti-ADAMTS4 antibody-reactive species present (Fig.1). Samples from a time course digestion of human aggrecan with this purified ADAMTS4 were taken for Western analysis with an antibody to the N-terminal G1 domain (Fig.2, lanes 1–5). This showed, as expected, the gradual appearance of a 65-kDa product with the electrophoretic properties of G1-NITEGE373. In addition, an anti-VDIPEN antibody probe of this blot (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5,lower panel) revealed the gradual appearance of a minor product at ∼60 kDa consistent with the migration behavior of G1-VDIPEN341. It was then shown that in 24-h digests at a higher enzyme concentration, the aggrecan substrate was totally digested and that these two products were generated in approximately equal amounts (Fig. 2, lane 6). Furthermore, when this 24-h sample was probed with anti-NITEGE (Fig. 2, lane 7) or anti-VDIPEN (lane 8) antibody, the results clearly confirmed that under these digestion conditions, ADAMTS4 generated both the expected G1-NITEGE product and also a significant amount of the G1-VDIPEN product. In these samples, the anti-VDIPEN antiserum also reacted weakly with a species that comigrated with the G1-NITEGE fragment (Fig. 2, lane 8), although the exact nature of this species is unknown at present.Figure 2Time course analysis of human aggrecan digested with ADAMTS4. Human aggrecan (200 nm) was incubated without ADAMTS4 (lane 1) or with ADAMTS4 (50 (lanes 2–5) and 109 (lanes 6–8) nm) for the time periods indicated. The digests were treated with chondroitinase ABC, keratanase II, and endo-β-galactosidase; run on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5 μg of aggrecan/lane); and then transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis. Anti-G1 (1:3000; lanes 1–6), anti-NITEGE (1:3000; lane 7), and anti-VDIPEN (1:3000; lane 8and lanes 1–5 in the lower panel) antisera were used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further study the production of G1-VDIPEN by ADAMTS4, short-term (7-h) digests at a range of enzyme concentrations were probed with the general anti-G1 antiserum (Fig.3). Aggrecan incubated with the lowest concentrations of ADAMTS4 (4–8 nm) showed some formation of G1-NITEGE, but no G1-VDIPEN formation was evident. As the enzyme concentration was increased (20–100 nm), there was clearly an increase in the loss of full-length aggrecan (Fig. 3, lane 8, black arrow) with a corresponding increase in both the G1-NITEGE and G1-VDIPEN products. At 100 nm enzyme for 7 h, the amount of G1-VDIPEN formed was approaching that formed by 109 nm enzyme in 24 h (Fig. 2, lane 6). Additionally, a minor product at ∼130 kDa increased over time (Fig.3, lane 8, white arrow); and because this species was anti-NITEGE antibody-reactive (data not shown), it appears to represent a non-reducible dimer of the G1-NITEGE product. At each enzyme concentration tested, there was always a greater yield of G1-NITEGE than G1-VDIPEN. However, at ∼100 nm ADAMTS4, the amount of G1-NITEGE present appeared to decrease between 7 and 24 h of incubation (compare Fig. 3, lane 8, with Fig.2, lane 6), whereas there was a concomitant increase in G1-VDIPEN. These results, together with Western analysis of these samples with the individual anti-neoepitope antisera (data not shown), suggested that G1-VDIPEN was formed by ADAMTS4-dependent cleavage of the initial product (G1- NITEGE) and that it was not formed directly from intact aggrecan in these incubations. The ADAMTS4-dependent formation of G1-VDIPEN in a 16-h incubation with 109 nmenzyme was completely blocked by inclusion of 10 mm EDTA, but was not inhibited by the presence of a mixture of TIMP-1, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, and pepstatin (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the proteinase responsible is a TIMP-1-insensitive metalloenzyme (presumably ADAMTS4) and not cathepsin B or another contaminating enzyme from the serine, cysteine, or aspartic proteinase family. To confirm this activity of ADAMTS4, we next tested the relative inhibitory effects of TIMP-1–3. TIMP-1 is a known stoichiometric inhibitor of MMP-1–3 and MMP-7–13, but does not appear to inhibit ADAMTS4-mediated degradation of aggrecan at concentrations up to 1 μm (32Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We therefore used TIMP-1 to examine the possibility that the cleavage of aggrecan at the Asn341-Phe342 site was due to a contaminating MMP in the ADAMTS4 preparation. In control experiments, TIMP-1 at 125 and 250 nm completely blocked formation of G1-VDIPEN generated by 44 nm MMP-3 (Fig.5, lanes 7 and 8). When human aggrecan was digested for 15 h with 54 nmADAMTS4 (Fig. 5, lane 2), both the G1-NITEGE and G1-VDIPEN products were formed, as expected. However, preincubation of ADAMTS4 with 125, 250, or 750 nm TIMP-1, before the addition of the aggrecan substrate, failed to inhibit the subsequent formation of either G1-NITEGE or G1-VDIPEN (Fig. 5,lanes 3–5). The production of G1-VDIPEN in these incubations was therefore clearly not due to the activity of a TIMP-1-inhibitable MMP. Interestingly, TIMP-1 addition appeared to increase the activity of ADAMTS4 because here was an obvious increase in the amount of G1-NITEGE formed at 250 and 750 nm TIMP-1. Similarly, there was an increase in G1-VDIPEN, further suggesting that these two products are generated by the same ADAMTS4 activity. The formation of G1-VDIPEN was next investigated with TIMP-2, which is a known stoichiometric inhibitor of MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, -10, -11, -13, and -14 and also does not inhibit ADAMTS4-mediated degradation of aggrecan at concentrations up to 1 μm(32Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we repeated the experiments shown in Fig. 5, but with preincubation of ADAMTS4 with TIMP-2. The results (Fig.6) were essentially identical to those obtained with TIMP-1, showing that the formation of G1-VDIPEN was not due to a TIMP-2-inhibitable MMP. This result provided further evidence that the production of G1-VDIPEN was mediated by ADAMTS4 and not by a TIMP-1- or TIMP-2-inhibitable MMP. The formation of G1-VDIPEN was next investigated with TIMP-3, which is a known potent inhibitor of ADAMTS4 (IC50 = 3–8 nm), but is much less effective against MMP-3 (Ki = 67 nm) (32Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 33Hashimoto G. Aoki T. Nakamura H. Tanzawa K. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As expected, when either ADAMTS4 or MMP-3 was incubated with aggrecan, the G1-VDIPEN product was generated, as indicated by Western analysis with anti-VDIPEN antibody (Fig. 7, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 4). When TIMP-3 was added at 125 nm, G1-VDIPEN formation was blocked in the ADAMTS4 incubations (Fig. 7, lane 3), but was essentially unaffected in the MMP-3 digests (lane 5). Taken together, these results strongly support the conclusion that ADAMTS4 is the G1-VDIPEN-generating activity in these incubations. To further examine the dual specificity of ADAMTS4, we investigated the capacity of the enzyme to cleave at both Glu373-Ala374 and Asn341-Phe342 in rG1-G2 substrates. First, the wild-type substrate containing both cleavage sites was digested with ADAMTS4, and the products were examined by Western analysis (Fig.8A) with anti-G1, anti-NITEGE, anti-VDIPEN, and anti-FFGVGG (AF-28) antibodies. The rG1-G2 substrate incubated alone was detected with anti-G1 antibody as a major band at ∼100 kDa and a minor unidentified band at ∼66 kDa (Fig.8A, lane 1). After digestion, the intact species was eliminated, and two new G1-reactive bands were detected at ∼60 and 55 kDa (Fig. 8A, lane 2). The 60-kDa product was also detected with anti-NITEGE antibody (Fig. 8A,lane 3), and the 55-kDa product with anti-VDIPEN antibody (lane 4); however, no species reactive with anti-FFGVGG antibody were detected on these blots (lane 5). These results show that ADAMTS4 can cleave at both Glu373-Ala374 and Asn341-Phe342 in this recombinant substrate, much as seen in digests with native human aggrecan. Because no high molecular mass FFGVGG-reactive fragments were seen, it is likely that G1-NITEGE was formed first, and then G1-VDIPEN was generated by removal of the Phe342–Glu373 peptide from G1-NITEGE373, much as was observed with ADAMTS4 digests of native aggrecan substrate. The low molecular mass FFGVGG-reactive peptide Phe342–Glu373, expected as the third product at ∼3 kDa (31Mercuri F.A. Maciewicz R.A. Tart J. Last K. Fosang A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33038-33045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in this digest, was too small to be detected under the electrophoretic conditions used. Following the observation that ADAMTS4 can cleave at both sites in the wild-type substrate, we next investigated whether the enzyme can cleave at each site in a substrate without prior cleavage at the alternative site. Independent cleavage at each of these sites has been demonstrated for atrolysin, MMP-8, and MMP-14 (34Tortorella M.D. Pratta M.A. Fox J.W. Arner E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5846-5850Abstract"

We have identified previously 20 S and activated 20 S proteasomes in Trypanosoma brucei, but not 26 S proteasome. However, the presence of 26 S proteasome in T. brucei was suggested by the hydrolysis of casein by cell lysate, a process that requires ATP but is inhibited by lactacystin, and the lactacystin-sensitive turnover of ubiquitinated proteins in the intact cells. T. brucei cDNAs encoding the six proteasome ATPase homologues (Rpt) were cloned and expressed. Five of the sixT. brucei Rpt cDNAs, except for Rpt2, were capable of functionally complementing the corresponding rpt deletion mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Immunoblots showed the presence in T. brucei lysate of the Rpt proteins, which co-fractionated with the yeast 19 S proteasome complex by gel filtration and localized in the 19 S fraction of a glycerol gradient. All the Rpt and putative 19 S non-ATPase (Rpn) proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from T. brucei lysate by individual anti-Rpt antibodies. Treatment of T. brucei cells with a chemical cross-linker resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of 20 S proteasome with all the Rpt and Rpn proteins that sedimented in a glycerol gradient to the position of 26 S proteasome. These data demonstrate the presence of 26 S proteasome in T. bruceicells, which apparently dissociate into 19 S and 20 S complexes upon cell lysis. RNA interference to block selectively the expression of proteasome 20 S core and Rpt subunits resulted in significant accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins accompanied by cessation of cell growth. Expression of yeast RPT2 gene in T. brucei Rpt2-deficient cells could not rescue the lethal phenotype, thus confirming the incompatibility between the two Rpt2s. The T. brucei 11 S regulator (PA26)-deficient RNA interference cells grew normally, suggesting the dispensability of activated 20 S proteasome in T. brucei.

Protein substrates are generally marked for degradation by their attachment to multiubiquitin chains catalyzed by a series of enzymes (1Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 2Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). The ubiquitinated protein is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner. The latter is a complex between a cylindrical 20 S proteasome and two 19 S regulatory complexes attached to each end of the cylinder (3Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The 19 S complex consists of a characteristic set of some 17 heterogeneous protein subunits classified into two subgroups. One subgroup contains six structurally related ATPases, designated Rpt1 to 6 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which are encoded by a unique multigene family well conserved during evolution (3Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) and perform the presumed role of unfolding and translocating the proteins targeted for proteasome degradation. Another subgroup of some 11 non-ATPase subunit proteins, designated the Rpns in S. cerevisiae, are mostly structurally unrelated to one another (3Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasomes have been universally identified among the eukaryotes as well as some of the archaea and eubacteria (3Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). There has not been any 26 S proteasome identified in either Thermoplasma acidophilum, Rhodococcus erythropolis, or any other prokaryote. But an archaebacterial ATPase, homologous to the ATPases in eukaryotic 26 S proteasome, was recently identified inMethanococcus jannaschii and found to activate protein breakdown by bacterial 20 S proteasomes (4Ng P. Zwickl D. Woo K.M. Klenk H.P. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26008-26014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic 20 S proteasome has a similar structure as that of prokaryotes, and high resolution crystal structures have been reported for the 20 S proteasomes of T. acidophilum and S. cerevisiaeshowing remarkable structural similarities (5Löwe J.

Recently, we have identified, purified, and characterized the 20 S proteasome from this organism (7To S.-B. Hua W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and we cloned full-length cDNAs encoding each of the seven α- and seven β-subunits of this complex. 1The GenBankTM database accession numbers of the DNA sequences encoding the 14 subunits of T. brucei 20 S proteasome are as follows: α1, AF198386; α2,AF148125; α3, AF198387; α4, AF169652; α5, AF140353; α6,AJ131148; α7, AF169651; β1, AJ131043; β2, AJ130820; β3,AF169653; β4, AF226673; β5, AF226674; β6, AF148124; and β7,AF290945. The trypanosome 20 S proteasome exhibits striking morphological similarities to the rat 20 S proteasome under electron microscopy (7To S.-B. Hua W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An activated form of the trypanosomal 20 S proteasome was identified and found to contain an additional protein of 26 kDa (PA26). Association with the PA26 heptamer ring confers enhanced peptidase activities on the trypanosomal 20 S proteasome (8To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Yao Y. Huang L. Krutchinsky A. Wong M.L. Standing K.G. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. J. Biol.

A functionally similar but structurally diverged protein PA28 has been described previously in vertebrates (10Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22699-22702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the many elements of similarity between the proteasomal systems of T. brucei and other eukaryotes, our efforts to identify the 26 S proteasome in T. brucei have been unsuccessful (8To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There could be two causes of this failure as follows: either the 26 S proteasome in T. brucei is unstable and falls apart when cell lysates are processed by conventional means, or there may be no 26 S proteasome in T. brucei. The second possibility suggests a need for an alternative means of activating the 20 S proteasome in T. brucei. The PA26-activated 20 S proteasome in T. brucei, which has not yet been identified in any other eukaryotic microorganism includingS. cerevisiae, could fulfill such a need. However, the PA26-activated 20 S proteasome exhibits only peptidase activity, not protease activity. Furthermore, although poly-ubiquitin genes (11Wong S. Elgort M.G. Gottesdiener K. Campbell D.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and ubiquitinated proteins are found in T. brucei (12Lowrie Jr., D.J. Giffin B.F. Ventullo R.M. Am. J. Trop. Med.

In this report, we demonstrate that a 26 S proteasome species is indeed present inT. brucei, but it dissociates into the 19 S complex and 20 S proteasome upon cell lysis. By using RNA interference (RNAi) inT. brucei (13Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), we also show that its function is essential for degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and cell viability. T. brucei strain 427 procyclic form cells were cultivated and harvested as described previously (7To S.-B. Hua W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The procyclic form T. brucei strain 29-13, which contains the genes expressing T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor (14Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Paul T. Englund of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The fluorogenic peptides LLVY-MCA,3 PFR-MCA, and GGR-MCA used in the peptidase assay, the cell-permeable bifunctional cross-linking reagent dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP), rabbit anti-ubiquitin antiserum, [methyl-14C]casein, and apyrase were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antiserum against rabbit IgG and [35S]methionine were from Amersham Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antiserum against mouse IgG and protease inhibitor mixtures were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit antisera against human Rpt1, Rpt2, Rpn8, and yeast Rpt2 were from Affinity Research Products. The S. cerevisiaestrain RJD 1171 in which Rpt1 was fused to a FLAG His6 tag was obtained from Verma et al. (15Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Lactacystin was purchased from Professor E. J. Corey, Harvard University. All the other chemicals used in the current study were of the highest purity commercially available. A mixture of 20 S and activated 20 S proteasomes of T. brucei was purified from procyclic form cells by centrifugation of the crude cell lysate in a 15–50% glycerol gradient as previously described (8To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For gel filtration, T. brucei lysate was fractionated using FPLC Superose 6 HR 10/30 chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Further purification of 20 S proteasome was accomplished by an additional DEAE-cellulose column chromatography step (8To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Isolation of 26 S proteasome from rat red blood cells was described previously (7To S.-B. Hua W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The FLAG His6-tagged 19 S proteasome regulatory complex fromS. cerevisiae was purified as described (15Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) using anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads from Sigma. For in vitrodegradation of [methyl-14C]casein (16Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar), samples of purified 26 S proteasome from rat red blood cells (5 μg), rat red blood cell crude lysate (200 μg), a purified mixture ofT. brucei 20 S and activated 20 S proteasome (10 μg), and T. brucei crude lysate (200 μg), each containing a protease inhibitor mixture, were tested. Each sample was preincubated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm ATP (2 mm ATPγS or 2 units of apyrase), and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 30 min on ice. [methyl-14C]Casein (3 μg) was then added to make a final volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was determined by scintillation counting. T. brucei procyclic form cells, suspended in methionine-depleted Cunningham’s medium at a density of 5 × 107cells/ml, were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) at 26 °C for 45 min. The radiolabeled methionine was then replaced by 1.3 mmunlabeled methionine to continue the incubation. Cell samples (4 × 107 cells) were taken periodically and lysed by sonication in 400 μl of TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl) including a protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate (containing 500 μg of protein) was first preabsorbed with preimmune rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose (17Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated proteins were precipitated using anti-ubiquitin antiserum and protein A-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and once with buffer A (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmDTT, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone). Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, autoradiographed, and immunostained using anti-ubiquitin antiserum. With DNA sequence information available from the data base of the TIGR Trypanosome Genome Project (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/index.shtml), 14 cDNA fragments with their sequences closely similar to those in the six proteasome ATPases designated Rpt1 to 6 from other organisms were identified. Four cDNA fragments, 49F12.TR, 13G6.TR, 100G1.TR, and 49F12.TF, that appeared to code for an Rpt2 homologue were assembled by Dr. Colin D. Robertson of the University of Glasgow. By using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with oligo(dT)30 (forward reaction) and the spliced leader (18Campbell D.A. Thornton D.A. Boothroyd J.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (TTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG; reverse reaction) as primers, we were able to clone the full-length cDNA encoding an Rpt2 homologue (GenBankTM accession number AF227500). For the other five Rpt homologues, we designed five specific forward and five specific reverse primers (sequences available upon request) based on the 10 TIGR partial cDNA sequences (clones 43D4.TR, 49F12.TR, 13G6.TR, 100G1.TR, 49F12.TF, 24C21.TF, 17C3.TF, 38C11.TF, 10F8.TR, and 18H6.TR) and carried out RT-PCR with oligo(dT)30 and the spliced leader as the primers for synthesizing full-length cDNA. The five full-length cDNAs were each cloned and sequenced (GenBankTM accession numbers: Rpt1, AF227499; Rpt3,AF227501; Rpt4, AF227502; Rpt5, AF227503; Rpt6, AF227504). Pairwise alignments of the open reading frames in the six full-length cDNAs with those of the corresponding Rpts from human and S. cerevisiae were accomplished using the AlignX program in the vector NTI 5.5 program suite (InforMax Inc.). The results indicate sequence identities of 54–69% and similarities of 73–81% betweenT. brucei and human Rpts and 51–66% identities and 67–80% similarities between T. brucei and S. cerevisiae Rpts, respectively (Table I in Supplemental Data). The six full-length T. brucei Rpt cDNAs were each amplified by PCR and expressed inEscherichia coli M15 from the pQE30 vector (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. The recombinant Rpt proteins, expressed mostly as inclusion bodies in the transformed E. coli cell lysate, were each dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl and purified through a Ni2+-agarose column (Qiagen) by the manufacturer's instructions. The purified recombinant T. brucei Rpt proteins (see the SDS-PAGE in Fig. I of Supplemental Data) were each used to produce rabbit antibodies (Animal Pharm Services, Inc., Healdsburg, CA). The coding regions of the six T. brucei Rpt full-length cDNAs were each amplified by PCR (primer sequences available upon request) and integrated into the yeast expression vector Dp22 by homologous recombination in yeast using the PCR-gap repair method (19Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstresser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Dp22 plasmid is a low copy (CEN/ARS), LEU2-marked vector into which a multiple cloning site has been inserted between the 5′ and 3′ regions of the S. cerevisiae RPT1 gene (20Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed to append 5′ or 3′ sequences of the S. cerevisiae RPT1 untranslated regions to the corresponding ends of theT. brucei coding regions. Following PCR-gap repair, the resulting expression vectors contained the T. brucei Rpt1 coding regions inserted between the two yeast RPT1untranslated regions and under the control of the yeastRPT1 promoter. Yeast manipulations were carried out using standard procedures (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology. 194. Acad. Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar), unless otherwise noted. Haploid yeast strains bearing HIS3-marked chromosomal insertion-deletions of individual RPT genes and containing the corresponding wild type gene on a low copy,URA3-marked plasmid were obtained from Daniel Finley, Harvard Medical School, and have been described previously (20Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4909-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed with individual T. brucei Rpt expression vectors by the lithium acetate method (22St-Gietz D. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected on synthetic minimal (SM, Bio 101, Inc.) medium lacking histidine, leucine, and uracil. For selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA), the SM medium was supplemented with 0.1% FOA and 50 μg/ml uracil. The loss of URA3-marked plasmids following FOA selection was confirmed by the failure of the reverted strains to grow in medium lacking uracil. The [35S]methionine pulse-labeled T. brucei procyclic form cells, described previously, were suspended in 10 volumes of HEDS buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 msucrose, and 50 mm KOAc) plus 5 mm of the membrane-permeable chemical cross-linker DTBP and incubated at 26 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with the HEDS buffer and lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus a protease inhibitor mixture) after 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate, preabsorbed with rabbit preimmune serum, was incubated with rabbit antiserum at room temperature for 1 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. The precipitate was heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and the supernatant was boiled in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer plus 5 mm DTT to break the disulfide bond in DTBP prior to SDS-PAGE, which was followed by autoradiography. Partial cDNA fragments of the seven α- and seven β-subunits of 20 S proteasome, the six Rpt homologues, and PA26 were each amplified in RT-PCR using gene-specific primers with XhoI and HindIII linkers (primer sequences available upon request). The PCR fragments were each cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector and then subcloned into theXhoI/HindIII linearized pZJM vector flanked with tetracycline operators and T7 promoters (13Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The 5′ end cDNA segment (∼300–500 nucleotides) of each of the targeted mRNA was chosen for constructing the transfecting plasmid (see Table II in Supplemental Data) due to the highly diversified sequences in this particular region among the 20 cDNAs, thus achieving specific interference of gene expression. For the control plasmid construction, the linearized vector was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and self-ligated. The T. brucei procyclic form cells, expressing T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor, were grown in Cunningham’s medium (23Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1979; 24: 325-329Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 15 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B for maintaining intracellular stability of the T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor DNA constructs, respectively. Transfection of T. brucei cells with DNA constructs by electroporation was essentially as described (13Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Briefly, 109 cells were harvested, washed once with cytomix buffer (24Van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and suspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing 20 μg of thephleo-containing pZJM DNA construct linearized withNotI so that it can be integrated into the rDNA spacer region of the chromosome in T. brucei. Electroporation was carried out in a 2-mm cuvette using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with parameters set as follows: 1.6 kV voltage, 400 ohms resistance, and 25 microfarads capacitance. The cells were transferred to 10 ml of the antibiotics-supplemented Cunningham’s medium immediately after electroporation and incubated at 26 °C for 24 h. The transfectants were then selected under 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin until stable cell lines were grown up after about 3 weeks of continuous incubation. The transfected cells were cloned by limiting dilution. To induce synthesis of the ∼300–500-bp dsRNA, the transfected cells were further incubated in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline to induce the two tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters flanking the cDNA insert in the integrated plasmid construct. Cell number in the time sample was counted using a hemocytometer. The T. brucei expression vector pTSO-HYG4 (25Sommer J.M. Li S.-B. Hua F. Gottesdiener K.M. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which utilizes the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase promoter and replicates extrachromosomally by virtue of a minicircle origin of replication, was used for expressing the yeast RPT2 gene in T. brucei. By site-directed mutagenesis, a BglII restriction site was introduced upstream of the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hyg) in the vector to produce the plasmid pTSO-HYG4m. A puromycin-N-acetyltransferase gene (pac) was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pγG-GFP (26Singer S.M. Yee J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using primers with BglII and BseAI linkers. The PCR fragment was cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector and subcloned into the BglII/BseAI-linearized pTSO-HYG4m to replace the hyg gene with pac gene, thus generating the plasmid pTSO-PAC. The entire coding region of yeast RPT2 was then PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA using primers withSalI and BamHI linkers (primer sequences available upon request), cloned into a pGEM-T easy vector, and then inserted into the SalI/BamHI sites of pTSO-PAC. The resulting plasmid, designated pScRPT2-PAC, was used to transfect the T. brucei cells already harboring a pZJM-TbRPT2 RNAi construct. The transfectants, selected under 1.0 μg/ml puromycin, were grown in the presence of puromycin, phleomycin, hygromycin B, and G418 in culture medium. Synthesis of the dsRNA, encoding a portion of T. brucei Rpt2, was then induced in the transfectant by adding tetracycline (1.0 μg/ml) to the medium to disrupt the expression of T. brucei Rpt2 through RNAi. Total RNA was extracted from T. brucei cells using the TRIzol reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Thirty μg of total RNA was denatured, separated on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes in a 20× SSC (150 mm NaCl and 0.15 mm sodium citrate) solution. Northern hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1× Denhardt’s solution with 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After stripping the probes, the same blots were re-hybridized with an α-tubulin gene fragment as a loading control. RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers and first strand cDNAs as templates. Instability of the 26 S proteasome could have frustrated prior efforts to purify it from T. brucei (8To W.Y. Wang C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we monitored 26 S proteasome-like activity in the crude lysate using [methyl-14C]casein as a substrate (16Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). An appreciable fraction of the radioactivity appeared in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction (TableI). This apparent degradation of casein was inhibited when ATP was replaced with the inactive analogue ATPγS or when the lysate was pretreated to remove existing ATP. Addition of 5 μm lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome (27Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar) and of the 20 S proteasome peptidase activity inT. brucei (28To M.C. Mutomba W.Y. Hyun W.C. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), also blocked degradation (Table I). These characteristics are those expected of the 26 S proteasome. The activity is, however, less than one-third that in rat erythrocyte lysate on an equal protein weight basis (Table I) and suggests a relatively weak 26 S proteasome-like function in T. bruceilysate.Table IATP-dependent and lactacystin-sensitive proteolysis of [14C]casein by T. brucei lysate10% TCA1-aTCA, trichloroacetic acid.-soluble radioactivitycpmRat erythrocyte crude lysate2 mmATP7475.3 ± 180.42 mmATPγS107.5 ± 6.42 units apyrase87.3 ± 7.2Rat 26 S proteasome2 mm ATP7581.0 ± 479.52 mm ATPγS125.5 ± 10.52 units apyrase122.1 ± 6.7T. brucei crude lysate2 mm ATP2418.0 ± 184.02 mmATPγS576.0 ± 8.52 units apyrase384.8 ± 15.7T. brucei-activated 20 S proteasome2 mmATP381.5 ± 35.92 mm ATPγS170.6 ± 67.22 units apyrase145.3 ± 13.21-a TCA, trichloroacetic acid. Open table in a new tab We next examined the turnover of ubiquitinated proteins in intact T. brucei cells. T. bruceiprocyclic form cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased with unlabeled methionine, and the radiolabeled ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE via autoradiography or immunostaining using the anti-ubiquitin antiserum. The amount of [35S]methionine-labeled ubiquitinated proteins inT. brucei gradually decreased over a 30-h chase period (Fig.1A). The half-life of the ubiquitinated protein is about 10 h. Lactacystin treatment prevented the turnover for the duration of the chase period (Fig.1A). Thus, there is an apparent proteasome-mediated turnover of ubiquitinated protein in T. brucei, albeit at a relatively slow rate. When the"
https://openalex.org/W2789164329,"Multidrug resistance to anti-cancer agents (MDR) is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment. Current knowledge about genes that contribute to MDR is limited, however, and its mechanisms remain unclear. To identify genes involved in MDR, we performed differential display analysis and isolated a novel human gene, RB1CC1 (RBI-inducible Coiled-Coil 1). The 6.6-kb RB1CC1 cDNA encodes a putative 1594-amino-acid protein that contains a nuclear localization signal, a leucine zipper motif and a coiled-coil structure. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemical staining with anti-RB1CC1 antibody showed that endogenously expressed RB1CC1 protein localized to the nucleus. In MDR variants of human osteosarcoma cells, RB1CC1 expression increased in response to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxic stress and remained elevated for the duration of drug treatment. RB1CC1 expression levels correlated closely with those of RB1 (retinoblastoma 1) in cancer cell lines as well as in various normal human tissues. Moreover, introduction of wild-type RB1CC1 significantly induced RB1 expression in human leukemic cells. These data suggest that RB1CC1 may be a key regulator of RB1 gene expression."

Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The receptors play a key role in signal transduction and are important drug targets. Although the derivation of structure/function relationships of GPCRs has been the subject of numerous studies (2Schöneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), comparatively little is known concerning the transport of GPCRs via the intracellular membrane systems to the cell surface (3Edwards S.W. Tan C.M. Limbird L.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The first step of the intracellular protein transport is the insertion into the ER membrane. For membrane proteins, this process is mediated by signal sequences contained in the proteins and by a complex targeting/insertion machinery (4Hedge R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For membrane proteins with an extracellular N terminus like GPCRs, two different types of signal sequences can be distinguished. The members of the first group possess signal peptides for ER targeting/insertion, which are removed by signal peptidases of the ER membrane (type I membrane proteins; classification of Spiess (Ref. 5Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). The second group uses the first transmembrane domains of the mature protein as noncleavable signal anchor sequences for this process (type III membrane proteins). It is striking that, in the GPCR family, ER targeting and insertion is established by both types of signal sequences. The vast majority of the receptors have signal anchor sequences; a small group, however, contains additional cleavable signal peptides (6Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The reason one group requires cleavable signal peptides is not known for GPCRs and the other membrane proteins with an extracellular N-terminal tail. The addition of the signal peptide from influenza hemagglutinin to the β2 adrenergic receptor, which normally contains only a signal anchor sequence, enhanced translocation of the receptor into the ER membrane (7Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it was suggested that a signal peptide may facilitate the expression of functional receptors. A statistical analysis suggested that the presence of a signal peptide may depend on the nature of the N terminus of the GPCR (6Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In particular, the presence of signal peptides correlates with the length of the N-terminal tail and the number of positively charged residues therein (6Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is also unclear whether signal peptides are in fact essential for all those receptors that contain them. An essential function can be concluded in the case of the rat thyrotropin receptor, where deletion of a sequence containing the putative signal peptide led to nonfunctional receptors (8Akamizu T. Kosugi S. Kohn L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Ban T. Kosugi S. Kohn L.D. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, this may not always be the case: for unrelated membrane proteins such as the human sodium calcium exchanger (10Ho T.W. Loo C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19345-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A6 (11Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it was shown that mutants lacking the signal peptide are processed correctly. It is furthermore unclear how many GPCRs indeed contain signal peptides, because verification of signal peptide cleavage is hampered by low expression levels. The occurrence of a signal peptide by purification and N-terminal sequencing of the mature protein was, however, demonstrated unambiguously for the ETB receptor (12Wada K. Tabuchi H. Ohba R. Satoh M.

A hypothesis for the significance of cleavable signal peptides of GPCRs and other membrane proteins may be developed on the basis of the currently known mechanisms of the initial steps of ER targeting and insertion. These mechanisms are more completely established for secretory proteins (which must be translocated across the ER membrane), but it is generally accepted that membrane proteins follow the same pathways (4Hedge R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Brodsky J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 277-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, proteins are normally translocated across (secretory proteins) or integrated into (membrane proteins) the ER membrane in a cotranslational manner by membrane-bound ribosomes. This process begins in the cytosol with the synthesis of the proteins N-terminal tail. Cytosolic translation continues until the first hydrophobic segment appears, a cleavable signal peptide in the case of a secretory protein, a signal anchor sequence or a cleavable signal peptide in the case of a membrane protein with an extracellular N-terminal tail (membrane proteins with an intracellular N tail invariably use signal anchor sequences). Appearance of the signal in either case leads to the binding of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and consequently to a translation stop (“elongation arrest”). The SRP-nascent chain-ribosome complex is then targeted to the SRP receptor of the ER membrane. The nascent chain is transferred from the SRP to the translocase complex, and translation restarts. Secretory proteins are translocated across the ER membrane (and liberated after cleavage of the signal peptide), whereas membrane proteins are integrated into the bilayer. For membrane proteins like GPCRs, this mechanism implies major differences in the translocation of the N termini with and without signal peptides. For a membrane protein without a signal peptide (Fig.1A), the N terminus is completely synthesized in the cytoplasm, because translation is not stopped until the signal anchor sequence (TM1) appears. The N terminus must thus be translocated post-translationally through the translocase complex across the ER membrane. In contrast, for a membrane protein with an additional signal peptide (Fig. 1B), the N terminus is not translated in the cytosol because SRP binding to the preceding signal peptide stops elongation. Here, the N terminus can be translocated cotranslationally through the translocase complex. Taking these considerations into account, it is logical to speculate that signal peptides are necessary for N tail translocation of those membrane proteins for which a posttranslational translocation of the N terminus is impaired. GPCRs are ideally suited to address the question why some membrane proteins require additional signal peptides and the other not, because both pathways are established in this large protein family. In this paper we have assessed the functional significance of the signal peptide of the ETB receptor. We show that a mutant lacking the signal peptide is retained in a nonfunctional form in the ER and that the signal peptide is indeed necessary for translocation of the N-terminal tail of the receptor across the ER membrane. The transfection reagents LipofectAMINE and TransFast were purchased from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany) and Promega (Mannheim, Germany), respectively. DNA modifying enzymes and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Trypan blue and rhodamine 6G were purchased from Seromed (Berlin, Germany) and Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands), respectively. 125I-ET1 (2200 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides were from Biotez (Berlin, Germany). All other reagents were from Sigma (München, Germany). Plasmid pEGFP-N1, encoding the red-shifted variant of GFP, was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). The polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide was described previously (16Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). Standard DNA manipulations were carried out according to the handbooks of Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the plasmid constructs were verified using the FS Dye Terminator kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Weiterstadt, Germany). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). The plasmid encoding the wild-type, full-length ETB receptor with a C-terminal GFP fusion (pETB.GFP) was described previously (18Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). For the construction of a truncated ETB receptor fragment, the sequence comprising the N-terminal tail, first transmembrane domain and first cytoplasmic loop was PCR-amplified using pETB.GFP as template. The primer sequences used were 5′-CGCAAATGGGCGGTAGGCGTGTACGG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CAAGATATTGGGATCCTTTCGCATGCAC-3′ (3′ primer). The 3′ primer introduced a novel BamHI site (underlined). The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into pETB.GFP cleaved with the same enzymes, thereby replacing the BamHI/HindIII fragment encoding the full-length ETB receptor. In the resulting plasmid pETB134.GFP, the GFP moiety is fused to residue Asn-134 of the ETB receptor. For the construction of a corresponding receptor fragment without signal peptide, a similar PCR amplification strategy was used with plasmid pETB.GFP as template. In the 5′ primer (5′-GGCCTGTCGCGAAGCTTGGGAatgGAGAGAGGC-3′), the codon of residue Glu-27 was replaced by an ATG start codon (lowercase letters in the primer sequence). An upstream HindIII site (underlined) was also introduced to delete the sequence of the signal peptide. The 3′ primer was the same as described above for the construction of pETB134.GFP. The resulting PCR fragment was cut withHindIII and BamHI and cloned into pETB.GFP as described above. In the resulting plasmid pETB134/Δ26.GFP, the GFP moiety was again fused to residue Asn-134 of the ETB receptor, but the N-terminal 26 amino acid residues containing the signal peptide were deleted. To construct a full-length GFP-tagged ETB receptor lacking a signal peptide, the SnaBI/PpuMI fragment of plasmid pETB.GFP was replaced by the corresponding fragment of the plasmid pETB134/Δ26.GFP. Larger truncations (37, 46, and 55 residues) of the N-terminal tail of the GFP-tagged full-length ETB receptor and the receptor fragment described above were constructed directly using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The plasmids pETBΔ26.GFP and pETB134/Δ26.GFP were used as templates to construct the full-length receptors and the receptor fragments, respectively. The primer sequences used were 5′-GATCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTGGGAATGCTTTTGCAAACCTCAGCATAATG-3′ (Δ37), 5′-GATCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTGGGAATGCCACCCACTAAGACCTTATGGCCC-3′ (Δ46) and 5′-GATCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTGGGAATGGGTTCCAACGCCAGTCTGGCGCGG3′ (Δ55). The resulting plasmids encoding full-length receptors were designated pETBΔ37.GFP, pETBΔ46.GFP, and pETBΔ55.GFP. The resulting plasmids encoding the corresponding receptor fragments were designated pETB134/Δ37.GFP, pETB134/Δ46.GFP, and pETB134/Δ55.GFP. COS.M6 and HEK 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The isolation of crude membranes for the125I-ET1 binding assay and the immunoblots proceeded from confluent cells grown on 60-mm diameter dishes. Cells (5 × 105) were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 7.5 μl of TransFast reagent for the 125I-ET1 binding assays or with 18.75 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent for the immunoblots. The transfection procedure was according to the supplier’s recommendations. Cells were further incubated for 48 h (125I-ET1 binding assay) or 24 h (immunoblots) after removal of the transfection reagent. The transfection for laser scanning microscopy was carried out with cells grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm diameter dishes. Cells (1 × 104) were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 7.5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. Cells were further incubated for 48 h after removal of the transfection reagent. The 125I-ET1 binding assay was carried out with crude membranes of transiently transfected COS.M6 cells as previously described for stably transfected CHO cells (18Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and transferred immediately into a self-made chamber (details available on request). Cells were covered with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and GFP fluorescence was visualized on a Zeiss 410 invert laser scanning microscope (λex = 488 nm, λem >515 nm). Subsequently, either the cell surface or the ER of the same cells were stained with trypan blue (0.05%, 1 min) (19Schülein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or rhodamine 6G (5 μm, 20 min) (20Terasaki M. Reese T.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Trypan blue (λex = 543 nm, λem = >590 nm) and rhodamine 6G fluorescences (λex = 543 nm, λem = >570 nm) were recorded on a second channel, and their overlap with the GFP signals was computed. Crude membranes were isolated from confluent cells grown on one 60-mm diameter dish as described previously (21Schülein R. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28844-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the glycosylation of the receptor fragments, membranes (150 μg of protein) were treated with PNGase F according to the suppliers recommendations. Membrane proteins were dissolved in Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (12% acrylamide). For the differentiation of integral versus peripheral membrane proteins, high salt washes were performed. Crude membranes (150 μg of protein) were stirred for 1 h at 4 °C in either 0.1m Na2CO3 or in 4 murea, centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h, dissolved in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). Separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters as described (22Khyse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Filters were blocked for 1 h with blotting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5% low fat milk powder, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.0) and incubated with polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (dilution 1:2500 in blotting buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed four times (15 min each) with blotting buffer and incubated with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG (dilution 1:5000 in blotting buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed four times (10 min each) with blotting buffer, twice (10 min each) with the same buffer lacking milk powder, and once (5 min) with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Filters were incubated in staining solution (0.56 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 0.48 mm nitro blue tetrazolium) until bands became visible. A data set comprising a total of 877 GPCR sequences was constructed from the tinyGRAP GPCR data base (GPCR families 1a, 1b, and 1c; November 2000 release) (23Kristiansen K. Dahl S.G. Edvardsen Ø. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 26: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Edvardsen Ø. Kristiansen K. 7TM J. 1997; 6: 1-6Google Scholar) and the GPCRDB data base (GPCR families 2 and 3; December 2000 release) (25Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M.W. Horsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen O. Campagne F. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Putative signal peptides were monitored with the program SPScan from the Wisconsin GCG package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) with a minimum acceptable score of 7.0. If the hypothesis above holds true, the N terminus of a receptor mutant without signal peptide should be translocation-incompetent. The mutant receptor, however, should still be targeted and inserted into the ER membrane, because the TM1 of the mature receptor should assure the signaling properties as a signal anchor sequence when the signal peptide is removed (it was shown previously (26Audigier Y. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5783-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that almost every transmembrane domain of a GPCR can function as a signal anchor sequence if it is placed in the TM1 position). We constructed a signal peptide mutant of the ETB receptor by deleting the N-terminal 26 residues of the receptor (Fig. 2A, mutant ETBΔ26.GFP). The receptor mutant was tagged C-terminally with the autofluorescent GFP to allow visualization of the intracellular localization of the mutant. We have previously shown that a GFP moiety at this position does not influence cell surface expression or the pharmacological properties of the ETBreceptor (18Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). We first assessed whether the signal peptide of the ETB receptor has any significance for the establishment of a functional receptor. To this end, we performed125I-ET1 binding assays with crude membrane preparations of transiently transfected COS.M6 cells containing the wild-type receptor and the signal peptide mutant (Fig.3). For the wild-type receptor (ETB.GFP), a typical binding curve was obtained with aKD value of 27 pm, in good agreement with previous results (18Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). For the signal peptide mutant (ETBΔ26.GFP), significant 125I-ET1 binding was not detected. These results demonstrate that the signal peptide of the ETB receptor is necessary for the establishment of a functional receptor.Figure 3125I-ET1 binding profiles of crude membranes from transiently transfected COS.M6 cells expressing GFP-tagged ETB receptors with (ETB. GFP ) and without signal peptide (ETBΔ26. GFP ). Specific binding is shown. Data points represent mean values of duplicates, which differed by less than 10%. Unspecific binding contributed up to 30% of total binding. The results are representative of three independent experiments.

The calculatedKD and Bmax values are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the expression and intracellular transport of the signal peptide mutant, the GFP fluorescence signals of ETB.GFP and ETBΔ26.GFP were localized in living, transiently transfected COS.M6 cells by laser scanning microscopy (Fig.4A, left panel, in green). The cell surface of the same cells was visualized by the use of trypan blue (Fig. 4A,central panel, in red). Receptors at the plasma membrane were identified by computer overlay (Fig.4A, right panel, colocalization is indicated by yellow areas). For the wild-type receptor, GFP signals were detected at the cell surface, indicated by their overlap with the trypan blue signal. Additional GFP signals were located inside the cells, presumably representing transport intermediates en route to the cell surface or a receptor population that has become trapped as a consequence of overexpression and saturation of the transport system. In contrast to the wild-type receptor, no overlap of GFP and trypan blue fluorescence was observed for the signal peptide mutant. Instead, diffuse GFP fluorescence filled the interior of the cells with the exception of the nucleus. The signal peptide mutant is thus expressed, but is transport-incompetent. The intracellular retention of the signal peptide mutant may be the consequence of a folding defect that is recognized by the quality control system of the ER, which ensures the export only of correctly folded proteins (27Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We thus determined the membrane compartment in which the signal peptide mutant is trapped by the use of a fluorescent ER marker (Fig. 4B). After recording the GFP fluorescence signals of the wild-type receptor and the signal peptide mutant (Fig.4B, left panel, in green), the ER of the same cells was stained with rhodamine 6G (Fig.4B, central panel, in red). Colocalization of the signals was visualized by computer overlay (Fig.4B, right panel, colocalization is indicated by yellow areas). In the case of the wild-type receptor, the GFP signal surrounded the ER rhodamine 6G signal. The additional GFP fluorescence signals inside the cells overlapped with the rhodamine 6G signals, indicative of transport intermediates or receptors trapped as a consequence of overexpression (see above). The GFP fluorescence signals of the signal peptide mutant, in contrast, overlapped almost exclusively with the rhodamine 6G fluorescence signals. These results indicate that the signal peptide mutant is retained in the ER. Corresponding experiments with transiently transfected HEK 293 cells rather than COS.M6 cells yielded similar results (data not shown). Retention of the signal peptide mutant of the ETB receptor in the ER suggests that this mutant has a strong folding defect. If it is assumed that a lack of N tail translocation may cause such a defect, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the signal peptide is necessary for this process. Translocation of a protein domain across the ER membrane can be monitored directly by the introduction ofN-glycosylation tags because this posttranslational modification is only possible in the ER lumen. In the case of the N terminus of the ETB receptor, such an approach is simplified by the presence of a consensus N-glycosylation site at position Asn-59. Previous results suggest that N tail translocation of the ETB receptor leads to only a minor increase in the apparent molecular mass by a few kilodaltons (18Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). This difference is difficult to resolve when full-length receptors are analyzed. To assess glycosylation of the N terminus, we have constructed truncated receptor fragments comprising only the N terminus, TM1, and the first cytoplasmic loop (134 residues, Fig.2B). The signal peptide was present in one construct (ETB134.GFP), but deleted from the other (pETB134/Δ26.GFP). The use of truncated receptor fragments not only improves glycosylation detectability, but also guarantees that the N-terminal tail is the only domain to be translocated and analyzed for the influence of the signal peptide. Both receptor fragments were C-terminally tagged with the GFP moiety to allow their immunodetection. COS.M6 cells were then transiently transfected with the constructs, and crude membranes were isolated and treated with PNGase F to remove N-glycosylations. The GFP fusions were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-GFP antiserum (Fig. 5A). For the receptor fragment with signal peptide (ETB134.GFP), a 43-kDa immunoreactive protein band was detected in the untreated membranes, which was reduced to 39 kDa upon PNGase F treatment. The 43-kDa band thus represents the glycosylated, and the 39-kDa band the unglycosylated, form of the fusion protein. The apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa is in agreement with the calculated size of ETB134.GFP without signal peptide (receptor portion = 12 kDa, GFP moiety = 27 kDa), indicating that the signal peptide is cleaved after insertion into the ER membrane. Signal peptide cleavage is further confirmed by the fact that the mutant receptor fragment without signal peptide has an identical apparent molecular mass (see below). The detection of glycosylated forms of ETB134.GFP demonstrates that the N terminus is translocated across the ER membrane when a signal peptide is present. For the receptor fragment without signal peptide (ETB134/Δ26.GFP) in contrast, only the 39-kDa form was detected in both PNGase F-treated and untreated membranes. The failure to detect glycosylated forms of ETB134/Δ26.GFP indicates that N tail translocation across the ER membrane does not occur in the absence of a signal peptide. The other immunoreactive protein bands, which are detectable for ETB134/Δ26.GFP (apparent molecular masses = 37 and 35 kDa), may represent degradation products that are produced only if the N terminus is oriented toward the cytoplasm. The presence of ETB134/Δ26.GFP in the membrane fraction strongly suggests that TM1 can indeed function as a signal anchor sequence and mediate membrane integration. We have, however, not rigorously excluded the possibility that ETB134/Δ26.GFP becomes membrane associated solely because of the hydrophobicity of TM1. This would also prevent N tail glycosylation. To exclude this possibility, we performed salt (100 mmNa2CO3) an"

We cloned and characterized the mouse CysLT1 (mCysLT1) and CysLT2 (mCysLT2) to better study the roles of cysteinyl LTs in animal models of diseases. Pranlukast was a generous gift from Ono Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). MK-571 and BAY u9773 were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Pranlukast and MK-571 were dissolved in 100% ethanol to make 10 mmstock solutions. A mouse genome library (129 inbred strain) in λFix II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled partial open reading frame (ORF) of human CysLT1 (581 nucleotides), and a clone was isolated. The CysLT1 ORF from C57BL/6 was obtained by PCR with a genome template using sense (5′-ATTCCTGGAGAACATGAATGG-3′) and antisense (5′-CATTGTTCTGCACTGTAGATGAG-3′) primers. A mouse expressed sequence tag clone with 88.4% identity in cDNA sequence to the human CysLT1 was found during a routine BLAST search of the NCBI data base (GenBankTM accession number AI506060), and it was purchased from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). These three clones were sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer 373A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and found to be completely identical. The ORF of the expressed sequence tag clone was amplified by PCR with sense (5′-CGGGATCCCGAATGGAACTGAAAATCTGAC-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTCTAGAGCTTATTCGTTACATATTTCTT-3′) primers, subcloned into a pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI), digested with restriction enzymes (BamHI and XbaI), and subcloned again into an expression vector, pcDNA4HisMax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to obtain pc4HM-mCysLT1. For the cloning of a mouse CysLT2orthologue, the mouse genomic library in λFixII vector was screened by plaque hybridization using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled full-length ORF of human CysLT2 cDNA (19Nothacker H.P.

The fragments that hybridized to human CysLT2 probe were sequenced as described above. The putative ORF was attached with an hemagglutinin tag at its N terminus and subcloned into an expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) between the KpnI site and the XbaI site to obtain pc3.1-mCysLT2. The CysLT2 ORF from C57BL/6 was obtained by PCR with a genome template using primers designed from the 129 genome sequence. HEK-293 cells and B103 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; PC12 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; and CHO cells in Nutrient Mixture F-12 HAM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used for the transfection of HEK-293 cells, B103 cells, and PC12 cells, and FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for the transfection of CHO cells, according to the manufacturers' protocols. To obtain HEK-293 cells stably expressing mCysLT1, the cells were transfected with pc4HM-mCysLT1 and selected with 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Two lines of the cells (named HEK 7-1 and HEK 7-3) were chosen by the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in response to LTD4 (see below) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml Zeocin. The expression of mCysLT1 was confirmed by Northern hybridization. HEK-293 cells transfected with the vector alone were also kept in a medium with Zeocin and used as a vector control. To obtain CHO cells stably expressing mCysLT2, the cells were transfected with pc3.1-mCysLT2 and selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Two lines of the cells (named CHO-7A1 and CHO-8B3) were chosen by Northern hybridization and maintained in F-12 with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml G418. CHO cells transfected with the vector alone were also kept in a medium with G418 and used as a vector control. The cells stably expressing mouse CysLTs were loaded with 3 μm Fura2-AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) in a modified HEPES-Tyrode's bovine serum albumin buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mmCaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 0.37 mmNaH2PO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Wako, Osaka, Japan)) containing 0.01% Cremophor EL (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were detached from dishes with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, collected, centrifuged at 240 × g for 5 min in a 15-ml tube, and resuspended in the modified HEPES-Tyrode's bovine serum albumin buffer (2 × 106 cells/ml). The change in the fluorescence ratio (340 nm/380 nm) in response to LTs was monitored using a Ca2+ analyzer, CAF-100 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). [Ca2+]i was estimated as described previously (24Yamazawa T. Iino M. Endo M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A receptor antagonist was applied 5 min before stimulation with LTC4 or LTD4. We have recently established a zif268-driven promoter assay induced by receptor activation (25Kawasawa Y. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the original method was modified. Briefly, 1 × 104 B103 cells were seeded in collagen-coated 96-well microplates (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo, Japan) and transfected with 25 ng of pc4HM-mCysLT1 or vector alone in combination with 150 ng of zif268-firefly luciferase/pGL2, which was a generous gift of Dr. T. Naito at Japan Tobacco Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). They were incubated for 48 h and treated with LTs in a serum-free medium. Receptor antagonists were applied 15 min before the stimulation. The cells were lysed after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was determined by measuring luminescent signals using a luciferase reporter gene assay system, PICAGENE Dual Seapansy (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) and a Top Count luminescence counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). For the assay of CysLT2, 2 × 105 PC12 cells were transfected with 250 ng of pc3.1-mCysLT2 or vector alone, 300 ng of zif268-firefly luciferase/pGL2, and 250 ng of thymidine kinase-Renilla luciferase/pRL (Promega) and seeded in collagen-coated 24-well plates. After serum starvation for 1.5 h, they were stimulated with ligands for 6 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using PICAGENE Dual Seapansy and a Mini Lumat LB9506 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Firefly luciferase values were standardized to Renilla values. Total RNA was extracted from 129+Ter/Sv Jcl (Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and C57BL/6J Jcl (Clea Japan) mouse tissues including brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and skin, using Isogen (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 200 μg of the total RNA using a μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The RNA samples were denatured, electrophoresed on 0.7% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences) as described (26Chomczynski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ORF of mCysLT1, mCysLT2, or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) at 65 °C for 2 h in a Rapid Hyb hybridization solution (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were washed at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h and subjected to autoradiography for 5 days (mCysLT1 and mCysLT2) or overnight (G3PDH). Total RNA was prepared as described above from 129 and C57BL/6 mouse adrenal gland, peritoneal macrophages, and spleen. For elicitation of peritoneal macrophages, the animals were injected with 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate broth 4 days prior to sacrifice and peritoneal lavage using ice-cold PBS with 2 mm EDTA. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and 50 ng of random hexamers according to the manufacturer's protocol, and 2 μl of the cDNA was diluted in 38 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for PCR. PCR was carried out using a LightCycler System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the products were detected by measuring the binding of the fluorescence dye SYBR Green I to double-stranded DNA. The PCR reactions were set up in microcapillary tubes in a volume of 20 μl. The reaction components were 1 μl of diluted cDNA, 1 × FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a final concentration of 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm upstream and downstream primers. pc4HM-mCysLT1, pc3.1-mCysLT2, and an expressed sequence tag clone containing mG3PDH cDNA (GenBankTM accession number BF537941) purchased from IncyteGenomics (Palo Alto, CA) were used as standards. Primers were chosen so that they would yield PCR products identical in DNA sequence from 129 and C57BL/6 inbred strains. The following primers were used: mCys1-760+, 5′-CAACGAACTATCCACCTTCACC-3′; mCys1-923−, 5′-AGCCTTCTCCTAAAGTTTCCAC-3′; mCys2-662+, 5′-GTCCACGTGCTGCTCATAGG-3′; mCys2-843−, 5′-ATTGGCTGCAGCCATGGTC-3′; mG3PDH-879+, 5′-AGGTTGTCTCCTGCGACTTC-3′; and mG3PDH-1089−, 5′-CTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGCTG-3′. These primer pairs result in PCR products of 164 (mCysLT1), 182 (mCysLT2), and 211 bp (G3PDH). The standards and the samples were simultaneously amplified using the same reaction master mixture. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to activate the polymerase, followed by 50 cycles of amplification. Each cycle of PCR included 3 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 3 s of primer annealing at 67 °C for G3PDH, 65 °C for mCysLT1, and 68 °C for mCysLT2, and 10 s of extension at 72 °C. The temperature ramp was 20 °C/s. At the end of the extension steps, the fluorescence of each sample was measured to allow quantification of the cDNAs. After cycling, melting curves of the PCR products were acquired by stepwise increase of the temperature from 5 °C above the annealing temperature to 95 °C. Using LightCycler analysis software, the SYBR Green I signal of each sample was plotted versus the number of cycles, and the crossing points were obtained. These crossing points correlate inversely with the log of the initial template concentration. The levels of mRNA were estimated by subtracting the initial levels of target DNA in PCR reactions without reverse transcription, which represents genomic contamination. Then the mRNA levels were normalized to the level of G3PDH mRNA. Paraffin sections of the skin samples from 129 and C57BL/6 mice fixed in 10% formalin were investigated as described previously (27Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Fujimoto M.

Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissues were cut to 4-μm-thin sections, mounted onto silane-coated slides, deparaffinized, and treated with proteinase K (5 μg/ml in PBS) for 10 min at 24 °C and glycine (2 mg/ml in PBS) for 15 min at 24 °C. Then the sections were acetylated with acetic anhydride (1 ml in 400 ml of 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0) for 15 min at 24 °C. After washing with PBS, the samples were soaked in 2× SSC with 50% formamide, subjected to hybridization. Fragments of cDNAs for mCysLTs (mCysLT1 ORF at 687–887 and mCysLT2 ORF at 18–222) were amplified by PCR using upstream primers with a recognition sequence for Hin dIII and downstream primers with a recognition sequence for EcoRI, and subcloned into pSPT18 by directional cloning. The plasmids were linearized using Hin dIII to prepare the antisense probes and EcoRI for the sense probes. The probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled RNA probes (1 μg/ml) in a mixture containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC, 1 mg/ml tRNA, 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin were placed on the slides and coverslipped. Hybridization was performed in a humidified chamber for 16 h at 42 °C for the mCysLT1 probe and 50 °C for the mCysLT2 probe. The slides were washed in 2× SSC with 50% formamide for 20 min three times at 42 °C. Nonhybridized probes were digested in 20 μg/ml RNase A, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then rinsed for 20 min in 0.1× SSC three times at 42 °C. The digoxigenin-labeled probes were visualized using a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The slides were counterstained in methyl green for 10 min, washed in running tap water, and mounted. mCysLT1 and mCysLT2 were predicted to be polypeptides of 339 and 309 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The identities of the amino acid sequences between 129 mouse and human (16Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N. Abramovitz M. Figueroa D.J. Zeng Z. Connolly B.M.

The sequence of mCysLT1 was identical among 129, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice, and there was a mismatch in mCysLT2 sequences at the 213th amino acid residue between 129 (Val) and C57BL/6 (Ile). The preserved amino acids in the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor family, including two Cys residues in the first and second extracellular loops, Asp in transmembrane domain 2 (TM2), Trp in TM4, Tyr in TM5, and Pro in TM6, were all present in mCysLT1 and mCysLT2. mCysLT2 had the Asn-Pro-Xaa2-Tyr motif at the end of the TM7, whereas mCysLT1 had an Asp residue instead of Asn in the motif. There was no Asp-Arg-Tyr motif at the TM3/intracellular loop 2 transition in mCysLT1 nor mCysLT2, although it is a highly conserved motif in the G protein-coupled receptor family. Both mCysLT1 and mCysLT2 had possible phosphorylation sites in intracellular loop 3 and the C terminus, and CysLT1had several possible N-glycosylation sites in the N terminus and extracellular loops. Mouse orthologues of CysLT1 and CysLT2 were identified as functional cysteinyl LT receptors by several methods. CysLT1 and CysLT2 are known to increase [Ca2+]i (20Takasaki J. Kamohara M. Matsumoto M.

LTD4 evoked a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing mCysLT1 (HEK 7-1 (Fig. 2, A and B) and HEK 7-3 (data not shown)). LTC4 also evoked a slight increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2 B), whereas LTB4 or LTE4 did not (data not shown). These cells pretreated with a CysLT1 antagonist, pranlukast (Fig. 2 A) or MK-571 (data not shown), did not respond to LTD4, whereas they remained responsive to ATP. In a reporter gene assay, B103 cells transiently expressing mCysLT1 increased luciferase activity in response to LTD4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). The cells did not respond to either LTB4 or LTE4 at a concentration of 10 or 100 nm (data not shown). The LTD4-induced response was inhibited by pranlukast or MK-571 (Fig. 2 D). In CHO cells stably expressing mCysLT2 (CHO-7A1), LTC4and LTD4 exhibited dose-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3 A). The response was inhibited by BAY u9773, a nonselective antagonist of cysteinyl LT receptors (30Coleman R.A. Eglen R.M. Jones R.L. Narumiya S. Shimizu T. Smith W.L. Dahlen S.E. Drazen J.M.

ATP (10 μm) elicited the same level of increase in [Ca2+]i in CHO-7A1, CHO-8B3, and the vector control (n = 3; data not shown). PC12 cells transiently expressing mCysLT2 increased luciferase activities in response to LTC4 and LTD4 to the same extent in dose-dependent manners (Fig. 3 C), and the responses were inhibited by BAY u9773 and not by MK-571 (Fig. 3 D).

BAY u9773 was partially agonistic on mCysLT2 as is reported in human CysLT2 (19Nothacker H.P. Wang Z. Zhu Y. Reinscheid R.K. Lin S.H. Civelli O. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Hybridization of poly(A)+ RNA from various mouse tissues detected transcripts of 3.0 and 5.5 kb for CysLT1 and CysLT2, respectively (Fig. 4 A). As a whole, the expression levels of CysLTs were higher in C57BL/6 inbred strain than in 129 inbred strain, even though a slight difference in control hybridization (G3PDH) in Northern blotting was observed in some tissues. In C57BL/6 strain, the highest mRNA expression for CysLT1 was observed in skin, lung, small intestine, and macrophages, and moderate expressions were found in other tissues; the expression of CysLT2 was ubiquitous with higher expressions in spleen, lung, and small intestine (Fig. 4). Differential tissue expression between two strains suggests that regulatory polymorphism is present. Given the importance of cysteinyl LTs in skin diseases including atopic dermatitis (31Hishinuma T. Suzuki N. Aiba S. Tagami H. Mizugaki M. Br. J. Dermatol. 2001; 144: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we investigated the distribution of CysLTs in mouse skin by in situ hybridization. We chose 129 inbred strain because Goulet et al. (32Goulet J.L. Byrum R.S. Key M.L. Nguyen M. Wagoner V.A. Koller B.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4899-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) had reported the potent inflammatory response of the skin in 129 mice. No signals of CysLTs were detected in epidermis (data not shown). In the subcutaneous connective tissues, however, high expressions of CysLT1 (Fig. 5 a) and CysLT2mRNA (Fig. 5 c) were seen mostly in fibroblasts. No signal was obtained using the sense control (Fig. 5, b and d). It has been reported that cysteinyl LTs increase collagen synthesis in fibroblasts (33Phan S.H. McGarry B.M. Loeffler K.M. Kunkel S.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Abe M. Kurosawa M. Ishikawa O. Miyachi Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106 (suppl.): 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and our report is the first to demonstrate the expression of CysLTs in fibroblasts. Further study is needed to uncover yet unknown roles of cysteinyl LTs in wound healing and pathological collagen synthesis. In conclusion, we have cloned mCysLT1 and mCysLT2 and found differences in the pharmacological characteristics between mouse and human CysLT2. There are differences in mRNA expression of CysLT1 and CysLT2 between mouse strains, suggesting the importance of choosing a proper mouse strain for a disease model. We also discovered expression of both CysLTs in subcutaneous fibroblasts. These data are useful in interpreting and understanding the physiological and pathological roles of CysLTs in animal models of human diseases. We thank Drs. D. A. Wong, S. Sato, and K.

The gene of this enzyme was cloned, sequenced, and subjected to site-directed mutation and deletion analyses. The nucleotide sequence indicated that the chitosanase was composed of 797 amino acids and its molecular weight was 85,610. Unlike conventional family 46 chitosanases, the enzyme has family 8 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic domain, at the amino-terminal side, and discoidin domain at the carboxyl-terminal region. Expression of the cloned gene in Escherichia coli revealed β-1,4-glucanase function, besides chitosanase activity. Analyses by zymography and immunoblotting suggested that the active enzyme was, after removal of signal peptide, produced from inactive 81-kDa form by proteolysis at the carboxyl-terminal region. Replacements of Glu115 and Asp176, highly conserved residues in the family 8 glycosylase region, with Gln and Asn caused simultaneous loss of chitosanase and glucanase activities, suggesting that these residues formed part of the catalytic site. Truncation experiments demonstrated indispensability of an amino-terminal region spanning 425 residues adjacent to the signal peptide.

Nagae S. Kawagishi H. Mitsutomi M. Ohtakara A. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Chitosanase is more restrictively defined as the enzymes capable of hydrolyzing chitosan but not chitin (6.Fukamizo T. Brzezinski R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 687-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to sequence-based classification of glycosyl hydrolases by Henrissat and Bairoch (7.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1966; 316: 695-696Crossref Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), chitosanase belongs to family 46. Although family 46 chitosanases are without glucanase activity (1.Ando A. Noguchi K. Yanagi M.

Among the four enzymes, amino acid sequence has been determined with two species, whereas very little is known about these chitosanase-glucanase proteins at the gene level. Obviously, further data on amino acid sequences and functional domains of various chitosanases and glucanases are required for appropriate definition and classification of the enzyme groups. The present report deals with a chitosanase, newly found in Paenibacillus fukuinensis D2 culture supernatant. This enzyme belongs to family 8 glycosyl hydrolase group, rather than family 46 chitosanase and its molecular weight is the highest among the members. Uniquely, the D2 chitosanase-glucanase has discoidin domain at the carboxyl-terminal side. Mutational analysis has been made to define the catalytic center and minimal region required for the activity. Chitosan 10B (less than 10% acetylated chitosan) was obtained from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Glycol chitosan, glycol chitin, and lichenan were purchased from Sigma, carboxymethyl (CM) 1The abbreviations used are: CM-cellulosecarboxymethyl celluloseMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid -cellulose sodium salt, Congo red, and d-glucosamine hydrochloride were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.

Ampicillin, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal), and isopropyl-1-β-thio-d-galactopyranoside were obtained from Nippon gene (Toyama, Japan). Yeast extract, tryptone, and beef extract were purchased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). All other chemicals were reagent grade or molecular biological grade. carboxymethyl cellulose 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid P. fukuinensis D2, was isolated from soil collected in Fukui, Japan, and selected for its ability to form clear zones on agar plates containing 0.5% (w/v) colloidal chitosan, 0.5% tryptone, 1.0% beef extract, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.1% MgSO4, and 1.5% agar at pH 7.0. Apparently, this bacterium was an active chitosanase producer and was chosen for further studies of this enzyme.P. fukuinensis D2 was identified as a novel bacterium of genus Paenibacillus on the basis of its rRNA sequence, morphology, chemical, and physiological properties. 2H. Kimoto, H. Kusaoke, I. Yamamoto, Y. Fujii, T. Onodera, and A. Taketo, submitted for publication. For chitosanase production, P. fukuinensis D2 was grown for 4 days at 30 °C with shaking, in chitosanase production medium containing 0.5% (w/v) colloidal chitosan, 0.5% tryptone, 0.1% beef extract, 0.1% KH2PO4, and 0.1% MgSO4 at pH 7.0. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as the cloning host for recombinant plasmids and cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C. Plasmid pUC19 was used as the cloning vector (13.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). Electrotransformation was used for introduction of plasmid DNA into E. coli (14.Kimoto H. Taketo A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on agar media containing 0.5% (w/v) colloidal chitosan, 0.5% glycol chitosan, 0.5% CM-cellulose, or 0.4% glycol chitin. E. coli was incubated at 37 °C for 2 days and P. fukuinensis D2 was incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. After incubation, the agar plate was flooded with Congo red solution (1 mg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature followed by further treatment with 1 m NaCl (15.Teather R.M. Wood P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 43: 777-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Cantwell B.A. McConnell D.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 23: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17.Shen H. Gilkes N.R. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells of P. fukuinensis D2 were grown in 2 liters of the chitosanase production medium at 30 °C for 4 days and the culture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min (6,500 × g). To the supernatant obtained, ammonium sulfate was added to 70% saturation, and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min, dissolved in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and dialyzed against the buffer at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied on a column (3.0 × 30 cm) of SP-Sephadex C-50 (Amersham Bioscience UK Ltd.) equilibrated with the phosphate buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m) at a flow rate of 50 ml h−1 and the fractions having chitosanase activity were pooled and concentrated by Ultrafree-15 centrifuge filter units (Millipore). Proteins in the eluates were detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. SDS-PAGE (7.5% total acrylamide) of the enzyme was carried out by the method of Laemmli (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under reduced condition, and protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Zymogram analysis was performed as follows. Protein samples were heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 60 °C for 1 h. Proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE containing 0.1% glycol chitosan or CM-cellulose. Electrophoresis was run at 20 mA for 1.5 h at room temperature. The gel was washed with 25 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (glycol chitosan gel) or 3 h (CM-cellulose gel). After incubation, the gel was immersed in Congo red solution (1 mg/ml) for 15 min and washed with 1 m NaCl. Gels were analyzed using a FluorImager SI fluorescent scanning system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). After SDS-PAGE (7.5% total acrylamide), the purified chitosanase band was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sequi-Blot PVDF; pore size, 0.2-μm, Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. The blotted protein was cut out from the membrane, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation with a PE Applied Biosystems model 491 Procise protein sequencing system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy method, with a PE Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencing system (PE Applied Biosystems) or Hitachi automated DNA sequencer SQ-5500 (Hitachi Intruments Service, Japan). Both strands of PCR products were directly sequenced using appropriate primers. The nucleotide sequence data were analyzed using GENETYX computer software (Software development Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The strategy used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of chitosanase gene was based on the determined partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence AGEMMPFPQQV. Degenerate PCR primer CT1 (5′-GCNGGNGARATGATGCC-3′) and nested primer CT2 (5′-ATGATGCCNTTYCCNCA-3′) were synthesized for amplification of the chitosanase gene by degenerate PCR. For amplification of the chitosanase gene, chromosomal DNA of P. fukuinensis D2 was digested with HindIII and ligated with double-stranded DNA cassettes possessing HindIII sites. Then, cassette-ligated DNA was amplified by PCR, using the primers CT1, CT2, cassette primers C1, C2, and TaKaRa LA PCR in vitroCloning Kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). Referring to the partial nucleotide sequence obtained, primer CT3 (5′-TGCCTGTAATCTCGCCTTTGACATAGTAGC-3′), CT4 (5′-GAAGCGAGGAGAGATTGTTTTTCAAATACTTGC-3′), CT5 (5′-GGTACTTGAATGAATTCCAGCAAACGAATG-3′), and CT6 (5′-GCAAGCAACAGTCCAGCTAATATCCGTGAC-3′) were designed. Chromosomal DNA of P. fukuinensis D2 was digested with EcoRI and ligated with double-stranded DNA cassettes possessingEcoRI sites. The cassette-ligated DNA was amplified by PCR, using the above four primers (CT3-CT6) and cassette primers (C1 and C2). To isolate complete chitosanase gene, the 3′ region was further amplified from XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA of P. fukuinensis D2 by PCR, using primer CT-7 (5′-CCTCCTATACGATTCAAGTGTCC-3′) and nested primer CT-8 (5′-CATCGATGACATTACGTTCAC-3′). Primers CT-9 (5′-GAGATTGCGCCTGGAGTCAGAC-3′) and CT-10 (5′-TCTGCCTGTTCCGCCTTTACCT-3′) were newly designed and the full-length chitosanase gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA of P. fukuinensis D2 by PCR, using them. The amplified DNA fragment was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and cloned into pUC19 predigested with SmaI, to yield plasmids pCG1 (inserted in series with lacP) and pCG2 (inserted in reverse direction with lacP). The nucleotide sequence of the fragment has been confirmed by sequencing. An overnight culture of E. coli XL1-Blue harboring recombinant chitosanase gene was diluted 1:20 into fresh medium and grown until theA 660 reached 0.6. The culture was then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h or incubated for 5 h without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.9), and sonicated. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min), and the supernatant was used as the enzyme source. Chitosanase activity was assayed using soluble chitosan as a substrate (10.Uchida Y. Ohtakara A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 501-505Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture, consisting of 0.5 ml of 0.5% soluble chitosan in 50 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and 0.5 ml of enzyme solution, was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reducing sugars released were determined (19.Dygert S. Li L.H. Florida D. Thoma J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the production of 1 μmol of the reducing sugar per min, using glucosamine as the standard. The endoglucanase activity was assayed using lichenan as a substrate. The reaction mixture, consisting of 0.5 ml of 0.5% lichenan in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and 0.5 ml of enzyme solution, was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The amount of reducing sugars released was measured by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method (20.Miller G.L. Blum R. Glennon W.E. Burton A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1960; 2: 127-132Crossref Scopus (703) Google Scholar). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the production of 1 μmol of the reducing sugar per min using glucose as the standard. Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), with the Protein assay kit II (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Antiserum was raised against chitosanase by injecting, into rabbits, a fragment of the enzyme deficient in the NH2-terminal 41-amino acid region and COOH-terminal 372-amino acid region. 3H. Kimoto, H. Kusaoke, I. Yamamoto, Y. Fujii, T. Onodera, and A. Taketo, manuscript in preparation. Culture supernatant of P. fukuinensis D2 was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% total acrylamide), and proteins were transferred onto Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h. The membrane was washed with PBST, then rabbit antiserum raised against purified chitosanase (diluted 1:1,000 in PBST) was added, and the blot was incubated for 1 h. Next, goat affini-pure IgG peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added at a 1:2,000 dilution in PBST, incubated for 1 h, and the antibody-antigen complexes were visualized with a POD immunostain set as described by the manufacturer (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Overnight culture of the P. fukuinensis D2 was diluted 1:20 in 20 ml of chitosanase production medium containing 0.5% glucosamine and grown to anA 660 of 0.25 (5 h), corresponding to mid-logarithmic growth phase. Overnight culture of the E. coli XL1-Blue harboring pCG2 or pUC19 were diluted 1:50 in 10 ml of LB broth and grown to an A 660 of 0.6 (2.5 h), corresponding to mid-logarithmic growth phase. Bacterial cultures were mixed immediately with 2 volumes of RNAprotect™ Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) by vortexing for 5 s and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 12.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 20% sucrose, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Immediately after the incubation, cells were sedimented by centrifugation (2500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), using a commercial reagent (IsoGen, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). RNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, and 10 μg of total RNA isolated from P. fukuinensis D2 or E. coli XL1-Blue were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose, 0.66 m formaldehyde gel, in 40 mm mops buffer (pH 7.0). Following electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (BIODYNE A, Pall BioSupport, East Hills, NY), and the membrane was probed with the32P-labeled 1461-bp chitosanase gene fragment spanning nucleotide 466–1926, in a solution containing 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% SDS, 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon testis DNA, and 50% formamide, for 16 h at 42 °C. Washing was done three times at 60 °C with a solution composed of 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS, for 30 min. The filter was exposed to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen at room temperature for 9 h. The size of the chitosanase mRNA was estimated by the positions of rRNAs and in vitro transcripts of known genes (Perfect RNA Markers, Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was performed using a commercial kit, TaKaRa LA PCR in vitro Mutagenesis Kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). The plasmid pCG2, carrying the chitosanase gene, was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. The two mutagenesis primers used were as follows: CT-MUT-3, 5′-GGGCACGTCCCAGGGCCAAGG-3′ (E115Q); and CT-MUT-4, 5′-CTCTGCAACGAACGGGGATCTC-3′ (D176N). The gene encoding full-length or truncated chitosanase was amplified by PCR, using specific primer sets listed in Table I. The primers were designed according to the sequence of chitosanase gene and contained modifications to add appropriate restriction enzyme sites for insertion into the vector. XbaI site in the forward primer and theKpnI sites in the reverse primer were underlined, respectively. The sequence of all PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotide primers used for deletion analysisRecombinant proteinSequence of primerΔN-41Forward5′-gCTCTAgAgCATggCCggCgAgATgATgCCgTTC-3′Reverse5′-CggggTACCTCACggCTTCCACCAgTTgCCCg-3′ΔN-45Forward5′-gCTCTAgAgCATgCCgTTCCCgCAgCAggTC-3′Reverse5′-CggggTACCTCACggCTTCCACCAgTTgCCCg-3′ΔN-49Forward5′-gCTCTAgAgCATgCAgCAggTCAgTTATTCCggC-3′Reverse5′-CggggTACCTCACggCTTCCACCAgTTgCCCg-3′ΔN-53Forward5′-gCTCTAgAgCATgTATTCCggCATTATAAAgCCTA-3′Reverse5′-CggggTACCTCACggCTTCCACCAgTTgCCCg-3′ΔC-372Forward5′-gCTCTAgAgCgAgATTgCgCCTggAgTCAgAC-3′Reverse5′-CggggTACCTCACGGCTTCCACCAgTTgCCCg-3′ΔC-373Forward5′-gCTCTAgAgCgAgATTgCgCCTggAgTCAgAC-3′Reverse5′-CggggTACCTCACTTCCACCAgTTgCCCgTAATg-3′ΔC-374Forward5′-gCTCTAgAgCgAgATTgCgCCTggAgTCAgAC-3′Reverse5′-CggggTACCTCACCACCAgTTgCCCgTAATgAAC-3′The primers were designed according to the sequence of chitosanase gene and contained modifications to add appropriate restriction enzyme sites for insertion into the vector.

Chitosanase activity was detected extracellularly, when the bacilli were incubated with colloidal chitosan or glucosamine which did not sustain the bacterial growth. Glucose was feeble in production of the chitosanase (Table II). These results suggest that D2 chitosanase is an exoenzyme inducible with chitosan or glucosamine. In addition to the chitosanase, strain D2 exhibited chitinase and glucanase activities on plates containing glycol chitin or CM-cellulose (Fig. 1). The chitosanase protein precipitated from D2 culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate was partially purified by chromatography on SP-Sephadex C-50, Bio-Gel A, and DEAE-Toyopearl columns. Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme preparation, two bands (67 and 40 kDa) were discerned as the major components (Fig. 2). Amino-terminal sequence of the two protein bands was identical (Fig. 3), suggesting derivation of the bands by cutting at different positions in the carboxyl region of a common precursor.Table IIEffects of carbon sources on “P. fukuinensis” D2 chitosanase productionCarbon source, 0.5% (w/v)Chitosanase activityUnits/ml%Colloidal chitosan1.08 ± 0.22100Glucose0.02 ± 0.021.9Glucosamine0.45 ± 0.0641.2CM-cellulose<0.001<0.4Lichenan<0.001<0.4The bacteria were grown for 2 days at 30 °C, in chitosanase production medium containing specified carbon source.

The enzyme activity (units/ml) was expressed as the mean ± S.D. from four experiments. Cloning of the Chitosanase Gene from P. fukuinensis D2—Based on the amino-terminal sequence, primers were designed and the chitosanase gene was cloned from P. fukuinensis D2 genome, using PCR. Sequence of 3031-bp region around the gene and the amino acid sequence deduced therefrom are shown in Fig. 3. The nucleotides 325 to 330 corresponded to the consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) and the trinucleotides 340 to 342 (TTG) 10 bp downstream the ribosome-binding site was inferred to be the initiation codon. Putative −10 promoter (TAAACT, nucleotide 289 to 294) and −35 promoter (TTGGCT, nucleotide 267 to 272) were present, about 50 and 70 bp upstream from the initiation codon. TGA (nucleotide 2731 to 2733) was regarded as the termination codon and an inverted repeat sequence (nucleotide 2777–2807) was seen 50 bp downstream from the codon. Free energy change value for the inverted repeat sequence was calculated, using GENETYX-MAC computer software described in “DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis.” This putative transcriptional terminator had a ΔG° of −23 kcal/mol (−95 kJ/mol). This inverted repeat was directly followed by a nonanucleotide composed of T, like ρ-independent terminator ofE. coli (23.Platt T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 339-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the primers CT9 and -10, a 2857-bp region of D2 genomic DNA including the putative promoter and terminator was amplified, subcloned into the SmaI site of pUCI9, and introduced into E. coli XLI-Blue. Cells of E. coli (pCG2), in which the chitosanase gene had been inserted in the reverse direction to lac promoter, formed lytic halo on plates containing chitosan or CM-cellulose (Fig. 1). This result indicates that D2 chitosanase promoter functions in E. coli, and the chitosanase gene encodes glucanase activity as well. From the nucleotide sequence, the chitosanase ofP. fukuinensis D2 was deduced to be a 85,610 Da protein composed of 797 amino acid residues (Fig. 3). A signal peptide sequence composed of 41 residues was present at the amino terminus, and its cleavage site was coincident with that of SignalP (24.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G.

Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Bucher P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1626-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 4). The discoidin domain C1 was composed of 130 amino acid residues (from Asn530 to Gly659), whereas the C2 domain was from Asn666to Gly796 (131 residues). Homology between C1 and C2 was 71.8%, and 135 residues were conserved. Alignment of C1 and C2 is compared with typical discoidin domain in Fig. 5.Table IIIAlignment of family 8 catalytic domains of “P. fukuinensis” D2 chitosanase and glycosyl hydrolasesBacteriaFamily 8 region“P. fukuinensis” D2GHFGSATDGDLDIAYSLLLAHKQWGSNGTA. xylinumPDKNNATDGDLLIALALGRAGKRFQRPDYBacillus circulansEGADSATDGDMDIAYSLLLADKQWGSSGSB. sp.

In a yeast two-hybrid screening for potential RIP-interacting proteins, we identified ZIN (zinc finger protein inhibiting NF-κB), a novel protein that specifically interacts with RIP. ZIN contains four RING-like zinc finger domains at the middle and a proline-rich domain at the C terminus. Overexpression of ZIN inhibits RIP-, IKKβ-, TNF-, and IL1-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner in 293 cells. Domain mapping experiments indicate that the RING-like zinc finger domains of ZIN are required for its interaction with RIP and inhibition of RIP-mediated NF-κB activation. Overexpression of ZIN also potentiates RIP- and TNF-induced apoptosis. Moreover, immunofluorescent staining indicates that ZIN is a cytoplasmic protein and that it colocalizes with RIP.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). RIP is a unique signal transducer in the TNF-R1-mediated NF-κB activation pathway. RIP was first identified as a Fas-interacting protein by the yeast two-hybrid system (20Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). It was later demonstrated that RIP is a component of the TNF-R1 signaling complex (4Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out experiments suggest that RIP is required for TNF-R1-mediated NF-κB activation but is not required for Fas- and TNF-R1-mediated apoptosis (22Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 23Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). RIP is a serine/threonine kinase that contains three domains, including an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain (4Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 20Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). RIP interacts with TRADD through their respective death domains. The intermediate domain of RIP interacts with the RING finger domain of TRAF2, and this interaction is required for RIP-mediated NF-κB activation (21Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that RIP directly interacts with IKKγ and therefore recruits IKK to the TNF-R1 complex (24Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, studies with RIP- and TRAF2-deficient cells indicate that TRAF2, but not RIP, is required for recruitment of the IKK complex to TNF-R1, whereas RIP is required for activating IKK (25Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 26Devin A. Lin Y. Li S. Yamaoka Z. Karin M. Liu Z.G. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3986-3994Google Scholar). Although RIP is a serine/threonine kinase, its kinase activity is not required for RIP-mediated NF-κB activation (21Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 22Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that RIP may activate IKK through a putative IKK kinase (25Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which is probably MEKK3 (27Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms responsible for RIP-mediated IKK activation are not known. In addition, it is not known whether or how TNF-R1-mediated NF-κB activation pathway is regulated at the level of RIP. To better understand how RIP signals, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening for additional RIP-interacting proteins. This search identified a novel RING-like zinc finger domain-containing protein designated as ZIN (zinc finger proteininhibiting NF-κB). Our results suggest that ZIN is an inhibitor of RIP-mediated NF-κB activation pathways. The recombinant human TNF, IL1, and IFN-γ (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), the monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG (Sigma), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the HA epitopes (Covance, Berkely, CA) were purchased from the indicated resources. The human embryonic kidney 293, the B lymphoma RPMI8226, and the T lymphoma Jurkat cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human ZIN was raised against a 21-mer peptide having the following amino acid sequence: QKEAEEEQKRKNGENTFKRIG. The NF-κB (Dr. Gary Johnson, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) and IRF-1 (Dr. Uli Schindler, Tularik Inc.) luciferase reporter constructs were provided by the indicated investigators. Mammalian expression vectors for HA- or FLAG-tagged RIP, ZIN, and its deletion mutants were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequently cloning into a CMV promoter-based vector containing a 5′-HA or FLAG tag. To construct a RIP bait vector, a cDNA fragment encoding full-length RIP was inserted in-frame into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The human B cell cDNA library (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was screened as described (2Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 3Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). 5′ RACE was performed using a mixture of several yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries as template. The 5′ primer corresponds to the sequence of the GAL4 activation domain: ACCGTCGACTGAAGATACCCCACCAAACC. The 3′ primer corresponds to the coding sequence of ZIN: AAGCGGCCGCCATCAGAAGCGATGC. Human multiple tissue mRNA blots were purchased from CLONTECH. The cDNA probe was an ∼1.0-kb fragment that encodes for amino acids 9–363. The hybridization was performed with the radiolabeled ZIN cDNA probe in the Rapid Hybridization buffer (CLONTECH) under high stringency condition. 293 cells (∼2 × 105) were seeded on 6-well (35-mm) dishes and were transfected the following day by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation (29Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, enough of an amount of empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection continued to receive the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.3 μg of RSV-β-gal plasmid was added to each transfection. Luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (BD PharMingen) and following the manufacturer’s protocols. β-galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent kit (TROPIX, Bedford, MA). Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression levels. Transfected 293 cells from each 100-mm dish were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, 0.4-ml aliquots of lysates were incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG and 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for at least 1 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analyses were performed as described (2Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Briefly, 293 cells (∼2 × 105) were seeded on 6-well (35-mm) dishes and were transfected the following day with 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid and the indicated testing plasmids. Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, enough of an amount of empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection kept receiving the same amount of total DNA. Approximately 24 h after transfection, the cells were stained with X-gal as described previously (30Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The numbers of survived blue cells from five representative viewing fields was determined microscopically. Data shown are averages and standard deviations of one representative experiment in which each transfection has been performed in triplicate. 293 cells cultured on glass coverslips were sequentially plunged into methanol and acetone at −20 °C, each for 10 min. Cells were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with either a CyTM3-conjugated Affinipure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in Gel/MountTM(Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Cells were observed with a Leica DMR/XA immunofluorescence microscope using ×100 plan objective. To identify potential RIP-interacting proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human B cell cDNA library with full-length RIP as bait. We screened a total of 5 × 106 independent library clones and obtained 26 β-galactosidase-positive clones. The inserts of 9 of the 26 clones are not in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain in the library vector. Among the other 17 clones, two encode for FADD, a death domain-containing protein that has been reported to interact with RIP (21Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), and one encodes part of a novel RING-like zinc finger domain-containing protein, which we designated as ZIN. We further studied ZIN because some of the known RIP-interacting proteins, such as TRAF2 and A20, also contain RING or zinc finger domains. Since the ZIN clone obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening is not full-length, we obtained its full-length cDNA by a combination of GenBankTM data base searches for ZIN-encoding expressed sequence tag clones and 5′ RACE. These efforts identified a ZIN cDNA of ∼2.1 kb that is capable of encoding a 488-amino acid protein (Fig. 1A). The 5′ of the putative start codon (ATG) has an in-frame stop codon, and the 3′ of the cDNA has a poly(A) tail, suggesting that we obtained a cDNA fragment encoding full-length ZIN (data not shown). Blast searches of the GenBankTM data bases indicate that ZIN has no significant homolog to known proteins except that the C-terminal part of ZIN is almost identical to an uncharacterized, hypothetical protein called TRIAD3 (GenBankTM accession number (NP_061884). Structural analysis suggests that ZIN contains four RING-like zinc finger domains (RLDs) at the middle (amino acids 137–352) and a proline-rich domain (PRD) at the C terminus (amino acids 396–482) (Fig. 1A). The N terminus of ZIN has no detectable similarity with any other proteins. The structural properties suggest that ZIN is probably a zinc-binding protein. Northern blot analysis suggests that RIN is ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues as two transcripts of ∼3.0 and ∼6.0 kB, respectively (Fig. 1B). ZIN is expressed at relatively higher levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and testis (Fig.1B). To determine whether ZIN is expressed in mammalian cells at protein level, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 370–390 of ZIN. Western blot analysis suggests that ZIN is expressed as an ∼56-kDa protein in all examined human cell lines, including B lymphoma PRMI8226, T lymphoma Jurkat, and embryonic kidney 293 cells (Fig. 2). The size of the endogenous ZIN protein is similar to that of overexpressed ZIN, confirming that the identified ZIN cDNA encodes a full-length protein (Fig. 2). In 293 cells, the ZIN antiserum also recognized a second higher molecular weight band, which may represent a post-translationally modified or alternatively spliced form of ZIN or a different protein in 293 cells. To determine whether full-length ZIN interacts with RIP in mammalian cells, we transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged ZIN and HA-tagged RIP and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These experiments suggest that ZIN interacts with RIP in 293 cells (Fig.3). To determine which domains of ZIN are required for interaction with RIP, we constructed three deletion mutants of ZIN. These include ZIN-(1–364) that contains the N-terminal domain and the RLDs, ZIN-(127–488) that contains the RLDs and the C-terminal PRD, and ZIN-(365–488) that contains only the C-terminal PRD (Fig.3A). Transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the two RLD-containing mutants, ZIN-(1–364) and ZIN-(127–488), but not the RLD-lacking mutant ZIN-(365–488), interact with RIP (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the RLDs of ZIN are required for interaction with RIP. It has been shown that RIP is absolutely required for TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation (4Shu H.B. Takeuchi M.

To determine whether ZIN has a similar function, we performed NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assays. These experiments indicated that overexpression of ZIN could not activate NF-κB in 293 cells (Fig. 4,A and C). Instead, overexpression of ZIN inhibited RIP-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). To exclude the possibility that ZIN affects RIP expression but not RIP signaling, we examined RIP levels in the same lysates by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4A, RIP levels were not significantly changed with the increased expression of ZIN. These data suggest that ZIN inhibits RIP-mediated NF-κB activation. The two RLD-containing and RIP-interacting ZIN mutants, ZIN-(1–364) and ZIN-(127–488) (Fig. 3), also inhibited RIP-mediated NF-κB activation in reporter gene assays (data not shown). In contrast, ZIN-(365–488), which does not contain the RLDs and does not interact with RIP (Fig. 3), did not inhibit RIP-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 4B). In fact, ZIN-(365–488) could weakly activate NF-κB and potentiate RIP-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig.4B). These data suggest that the RLDs of ZIN are required for inhibition of RIP-mediated NF-κB activation. Previous studies indicate that RIP activates NF-κB through IKK (11DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

As shown in Fig. 4C, ZIN also inhibited IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas ZIN-(365–488) weakly potentiated IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 4D). In these experiments, neither ZIN nor ZIN-(365–488) affected expression levels of IKKβ. These data, although unexpected because IKKβ is a downstream protein of RIP, suggest that ZIN can inhibit IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation. Since ZIN can inhibit RIP- and IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation, we determined whether ZIN inhibits TNF- and IL1-induced NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 5,A and B, ZIN, but not ZIN-(365–488), inhibited TNF- and IL1-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, ZIN did not inhibit IFN-γ-induced IRF-1 activation (Fig. 5C), suggesting that ZIN specifically inhibits NF-κB activation by TNF and IL1. Previously, it has been suggested that overexpression of RIP potently induces apoptosis (20Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 21Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Since ZIN is a RIP-interacting protein, we examined whether ZIN is involved in RIP-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig.6A, overexpression of ZIN did not induce apoptosis, but potentiated RIP-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In 293 cells, TNF alone does not induce apoptosis. However, overexpression of ZIN could consistently sensitize ∼30% of transfected 293 cells to TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B). IKKβ(K/A), an IKKβ kinase-inactive mutant that can inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation (17Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 28Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), could also sensitize 293 cells to TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B). One of the possible explanations for inhibition of RIP-mediated NF-κB activation by ZIN is that ZIN may dissociate TRAF2 from RIP. TRAF2 contains one RING finger domain and four zinc finger domains at its N terminus (43Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the RING finger domain of TRAF2 interacts with the intermediate domain of RIP and that this interaction is important for TRAF2- and RIP-mediated NF-κB activation (21Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Since the RLDs of ZIN are also responsible for interacting with RIP, we investigated the possibility that ZIN may compete with TRAF2 for binding to RIP. To do this, we transfected 293 cells with constant amounts of expression plasmids for TRAF2 and RIP and increased amounts of expression plasmid for ZIN. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that ZIN could not compete with TRAF2 for interaction with RIP (data not shown). ZIN has a putative nuclear localization signal sequence (amino acids 47–52). To determine the cellular localization of ZIN, we performed immunofluorescent microscopy. These experiments suggest that ZIN is mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7). To determine whether RIP colocalizes with ZIN, we transfected 293 cells with an expression plasmid for HA-tagged RIP and performed double immunofluorescent staining. These experiments suggest that overexpressed RIP overlaps with endogenous ZIN (Fig. 7). In addition, we noticed that overexpression of RIP caused substantial aggregation of ZIN (Fig. 7), pointing to the possibility that overexpression of RIP leads to the formation of complexes that contain RIP, ZIN, and other molecules. During the past several years, tremendous progress has been achieved on the molecular mechanisms of TNF-R1 signaling. TNF stimulation of TNF-R1 leads to recruitment of the adapter protein TRADD to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (2Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

TRADD recruits FADD and caspase-8 to activate caspase cascades, and this leads to mitochondria-dependent and -independent apoptosis (2Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). These models have now become paradigms of how all TNF receptor family members signal. One of the major unsolved questions on TNF-R1 signaling is how TRAF2 and RIP activate downstream IKK. One group proposed a direct interaction between RIP and the IKKγ subunit of the IKK complex (24Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, studies with RIP- and TRAF2-deficient cells indicate that TRAF2, but not RIP, is required for recruitment of the IKK complex to TNF-R1, whereas RIP is required for activating IKK, probably through MEKK3 (25Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.G. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 26Devin A. Lin Y. Li S. Yamaoka Z. Karin M. Liu Z.G.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Currently, the precise mechanisms responsible for RIP-mediated IKK activation are not known. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify additional RIP-interacting proteins. This search identified ZIN as a novel RIP-interacting protein. ZIN contains four RLDs at the middle and a proline-rich domain at its C terminus. Overexpression of ZIN inhibits RIP-mediated NF-κB activation, and the RLDs of ZIN are required for this inhibitory activity. Unexpectedly, overexpression of ZIN also inhibited IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, however, we failed to detect an interaction between IKKβ and ZIN. The simplest explanation for this observation is that ZIN also targets a downstream signaling component of IKKβ. ZIN can inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation in 293 cells. Since only TNF-R1, but not TNF-R2, is expressed in 293 cells, these data suggest that ZIN inhibits TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation. This is consistent with the notion that RIP is required for TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation. Surprisingly, ZIN also inhibits IL1-induced NF-κB activation. Inhibition of TNF- and IL1-induced NF-κB activation is not due to a general inhibitory effect of transcription by ZIN because ZIN does not inhibit IFN-γ-induced IRF-1 activation. Our findings suggest that ZIN has multiple targets in TNF- and IL1-induced NF-κB activation pathways. Currently, we do not know which protein(s) in the IL-1 signaling pathway are targeted by ZIN. Interestingly, ZIN-(365–488), a mutant that does not interact with RIP, can weakly activate NF-κB and potentiate RIP-, IKKβ-, TNF-, and IL1-induced NF-κB activation. It is possible that ZIN-(365–488) can at least partially neutralize the inhibitory effect of full-length ZIN. The structural and functional properties of ZIN are very similar to a previously characterized protein A20 (24Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D.

A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out studies have demonstrated a critical role for A20 in inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation and inflammation (41Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that the zinc finger domains of A20 are also required for its inhibition of TNF- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (40Klinkenberg M. Huffel S.V. Heyninck K. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since the RLDs of ZIN are responsible for interacting with RIP, it is possible that ZIN may compete with TRAF2 for binding to RIP and therefore inhibit RIP-mediated NF-κB activation. However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that this is not the case, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in ZIN-mediated inhibition of RIP-induced NF-κB activation. Overexpression of ZIN potentiates RIP- and TNF-induced apoptosis in 293 cells. Previously, it has been shown that NF-κB activation can prevent cells from apoptosis induced by TNF and other stimuli (13Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar,44Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for ZIN′s potentiation of RIP- and TNF-induced apoptosis is that ZIN inhibits RIP-induced NF-κB activation and thus sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Sequence analysis suggests that a bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence exists at amino acids 36–53 of ZIN. This raises the possibility that ZIN is a nuclear protein. However, our immunofluorescent staining experiments suggest that ZIN is mainly localized to the cytoplasm. Moreover, these experiments indicate that overexpressed RIP colocalizes with ZIN and causes the aggregation of ZIN. These data provide additional evidences that ZIN is functionally associated with RIP. In conclusion, we have identified a novel RING-like zinc finger protein that is capable of inhibiting TNF- and IL1-induced NF-κB activation. The identification of ZIN, like A20, may shed new light on the negative regulation of TNF- and IL1-induced NF-κB activation pathways. However, the data provided in this study were mostly from protein overexpression; a physiological role for ZIN needs to be defined by experiments dealing with endogenous protein and/or gene knock-out studies."

TSG-6 protein has been detected in the articular joints of osteoarthritis (OA) patients, with little or no constitutive expression in normal adult tissues. It interacts with components of cartilage matrix (e.g. hyaluronan and aggrecan) and thus may be involved in extracellular remodeling during joint disease. In addition, TSG-6 has been found to have anti-inflammatory properties in models of acute and chronic inflammation. Here we have mapped the human TSG-6 gene to 2q23.3, a region of chromosome 2 linked with OA. A single nucleotide polymorphism was identified that involves a non-synonymous G → A transition at nucleotide 431 of the TSG-6 coding sequence, resulting in an Arg to Gln alteration in the CUB module (at residue 144 in the preprotein). Molecular modeling of the CUB domain indicated that this amino acid change might lead to functional differences. Typing of 400 OA cases and 400 controls revealed that the A431 variant identified here is the major TSG-6 allele in Caucasians (with over 75% being A431 homozygotes) but that this polymorphism is not a marker for OA susceptibility in the patients we have studied. Expression of the Arg144 and Gln144 allotypes in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, and functional characterization, showed that there were no significant differences in the ability of these full-length proteins to bind hyaluronan or form a stable complex with inter-α-inhibitor.

The production of TSG-6 is tightly controlled, with little or no constitutive expression in adult tissues, and is induced during inflammatory disease (e.g. arthritis; see below) as well as in normal “inflammation-like” processes (e.g. cumulus-oocyte complex expansion prior to ovulation (4Fülöp C.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 1485-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). TSG-6 protein has been found in the synovial fluids of patients with different forms of arthritis, including osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but is not detectable in individuals without known joint disease (7Wisniewski H.G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar); the highest levels of protein have been seen in RA, but similar levels were detected in some patients with OA (7Wisniewski H.G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar,8Goldberg R.L. Doughty J. Spirito S. Klien M. Peppard J. Crowl R.M. Hu S.-I. Trans. Orthop. Res. 1998; 23: 215Google Scholar). TSG-6 has been immunolocalized to both cartilage and synovium in OA and RA but was not detected in normal samples, making it likely that the source of this protein is the joint tissues themselves (3Bayliss M.T. Howat S.L. Dudhia J. Murphy J.M. Barry F.P. Edwards J.C. Day A.J. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 42-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For example, in OA cartilage, the majority of chondrocytes expressed TSG-6, usually with extensive staining in the surrounding matrix. In addition, TSG-6 has been detected in cartilage of the STR/ort mouse that develops a natural form of OA (9Flannelly J.K. Dudhia J. Day A.J. Mason R.M. Bayliss M.T. Trans. Orthop. Res. 2001; 26: 228Google Scholar). Interestingly, TSG-6 protein was detectable in the chondrocyte pericellular matrix before OA lesions developed, with an up-regulation of TSG-6 mRNA as the disease progressed. In vitro studies have shown that TSG-6 is secreted from a variety of cell types found in articular joints (including chondrocytes, synoviocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells) in response to inflammatory mediators and growth factors (reviewed in Refs. 2Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Bayliss M.T. Howat S.L. Dudhia J. Murphy J.M. Barry F.P. Edwards J.C. Day A.J. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 42-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For example, TSG-6 expression (mRNA and protein) is induced in human chondrocytes, from macroscopically normal cartilage, by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor, and transforming growth factor-β1 (10Maier R. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An mRNA fingerprinting technique identified TSG-6 as one of the major species to be up-regulated (∼6-fold) in response to IL-1β in chondrocytes obtained from OA patients undergoing joint surgery (11Margerie D. Flechtenmacher J. Buttner F.H. Karbowski A. Puhl W. Schleyerbach R. Bartnik E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1997; 5: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mature human TSG-6 protein is 260 residues in length and is comprised of an N-terminal sequence of 19 amino acids followed by contiguous Link and CUB modules (residues 37–128 and 129–250, respectively, in the preprotein (1Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar)) and a 27-amino acid C-terminal sequence. The Link module of human TSG-6, for which a tertiary structure has been determined (12Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), has been shown to interact with components of cartilage extracellular matrix, i.e.hyaluronan (HA), chondroitin-4-sulfate, and aggrecan (13Parkar A.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At present, the ligand binding specificity of the TSG-6 CUB module is unknown; in other proteins the CUB module (defined asComplement subcomponents C1r/C1s, Uegf,Bmp1 (17Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar)) has been implicated in protein·protein (18Sieron A.L. Tretiakova A. Jameson B.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Li M.T. Khan S. Stocker W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and protein·carbohydrate interactions (19Solis D. Romero A. Jimenez M. Diaz-Maurino T. Calvete J.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Full-length human TSG-6 (expressed in insect cells) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of neutrophil migration in a mouse air-pouch model of acute inflammation (20Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant TSG-6 was also found to ameliorate collagen-induced arthritis in mice, where there was a large reduction in pannus formation and cartilage erosion (21Mindrescu C. Thorbecke G.J. Klein M.J. Vilcek J. Wisniewski H.G. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and to have a chondroprotective effect in a proteoglycan-induced model of arthritis (22Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Mikecz K. Glant T.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1711-1721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In vitro, TSG-6 can form a stable (probably covalent) ∼120-kDa complex with inter-α-inhibitor (IαI); TSG-6·IαI complexes of this size have been detected in vivo(e.g. in RA synovial fluids (7Wisniewski H.G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar) and in expanded cumulus-oocyte complexes (5Carrette O. Nemade R.V. Day A.J. Brickner A. Larsen W.J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)), where they are likely to be involved in stabilizing extracellular matrices rich in HA. In addition, TSG-6 is able to potentiate the anti-plasmin activity of IαI (20Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether formation of the TSG-6·IαI complex is necessary for this activity. It has been hypothesized that the inhibition of neutrophil migration by TSG-6 is due to its effect on the plasmin network (2Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar), but this remains to be established. The TSG-6 gene has been mapped to human chromosome 2 but was not assigned to the p or q arms (24Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, as part of a genome-wide screen for OA susceptibility loci (25Chapman K. Mustafa Z. Irven C. Carr A.J. Clipsham K. Smith A. Chitnavis J. Sinsheimer J.S. Bloomfield V.A. McCartney M. Cox O. Cardon L.R. Sykes B. Loughlin J. Am. J. Hum.

McCartney M. Cox O. Sykes B. Loughlin J. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2000; 39: 299-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we obtained evidence for a linkage across a broad region of chromosome 2q ranging from 2q14.1 through to 2q31, with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 1.22, which increased to 2.19 in families that were concordant for hip-only disease. Therefore, it was thought possible thatTSG-6 could represent a susceptibility gene for OA, especially given its up-regulation in OA and its biological activitiesin vivo (described above). Here we have mapped the TSG-6 gene to 2q23.3 by radiation hybrid mapping and subsequently typed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), involving a non-synonymous G → A transition (that results in an Arg to Gln change in the CUB module), in a panel of 400 OA cases and 400 controls. The effect of this coding change on TSG-6 function was investigated by the expression of the full-length allotypes in insect cells and analysis of their relative abilities to bind HA and form a stable complex with IαI. The Stanford TNG Human/Hamster RH panel (Research Genetic Inc.) was used to map theTSG-6 gene with two amplimers; one amplifying a 214-bp fragment of the TSG-6 5′-flanking region (nucleotides −1040 to −800 in (24Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the forward and reverse primers were 5′-GGAGGGACTAAGAAAGCATG-3′ and 5′-TATCCCAAACTTTCCTCTTCC-3′, respectively), and the other a 208-bp fragment of the 3′-untranslated region (nucleotides 978–1185 in Ref. 1Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, the forward and reverse primers were 5′-AGGAAACTTTAAACGAGAAAATG-3′ and 5′-TTCATAAAGTTCAAGATTTAAAAA-3′, respectively). PCR was performed with TaqGold Polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 100 ng of genomic DNA, 3 mm MgCl2 (final concentration) and the following cycle conditions: 94 °C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min (5′ amplimer)/55 °C for 1 min (3′ amplimer) and 72 °C for 30 s. The amplified products were purified on 3% (w/v) agarose. First-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from human primary osteoblast total RNA (kindly provided by Dr. Bev Fermor) and used to amplify full-length TSG-6 (nucleotides 1–831 in Ref. 1Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) for 30 cycles of 94 °C, 57 °C, and 72 °C (1 min each) with Tli polymerase (Promega). The forward and reverse primers used, 5′-TATGGTACCATGATCATCTTAATTTACTTATTTCTC-3′ and 5′-ATATCTAGATTATTATAAGTGGCTAAATCTTCCAGC-3′, introducedKpnI and XbaI restriction sites (underlined), respectively, allowing the product to be cloned intoKpnI/XbaI-cut pAcCL29–1 vector (27Livingstone C. Jones I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two internal sequence primers were used (5′-GCCTATTGCTACAACCC-3′ and 5′-GCCAGTAGCAGATTTGG-3′), in addition to the PCR primers, to generate contiguous sequence data on both strands of the insert from three separate clones; sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA analyzer. ARMS analysis, a PCR-based method for detecting single base changes (see Ref. 28Dracopoli N.C. Haines J.L. Korf B.R. Moir D.T. Morton C.C. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Smith D.R. Current Protocols in Human Genetics (Boyle, A. L., ed). 1995; 2 (Unit 9.8, John Wiley and Sons, New York): 1-12Google Scholar), was carried out on genomic DNA from 38 HLA homozygous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (10th International Histocompatibility Workshop). Each DNA sample was analyzed in two (allele-specific) reactions, both of which contained control primers A and B (29Jenkins S.C. March R.E. Campbell R.D. Milner C.M. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 56: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which amplify a 360-bp region of the human α-1-antitrypsin gene, and a common TSG-6 reverse primer (5′-TCTCCACAGTATCTTCCCACAAAGCCATGG-3′). In addition, one reaction included the “g-primer” (5′-GGAGTGTGGTGGCGTCTTTACAGATCCAAAGAG-3′) and the other the “a-primer” (5′-GGAGTGTGGTGGCGTCTTTACAGATCCAAAGAA-3′), which can each amplify a product of 236 bp, in combination with the reverse primer, if the appropriate sequence (G431 or A431, respectively) is present. All reactions contained 1 μg of DNA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 120 μm each dNTP, 1.25 mm reverse primer, 1.25 mm g-primer or a-primer, 0.12 mm control primers, and 1 unit ofTaq Polymerase in a 50-μl reaction. Cycling conditions were: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min each at 94 °C, 61 °C and 72 °C, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A 229-bp PCR product was amplified from three genomic DNA samples (identified as either heterozygous GA, homozygous AA, or homozygous GG from ARMS analysis) using primers (forward: 5′-CAAAGGAGTGTGGTGGCGTCTTTAC-3′; reverse: 5′-CTTCCCACAAAGCCATGGACATCAT-3′) that flank nucleotide position 431 of TSG-6. The products were purified on agarose gels and sequenced using the reverse primer. The 5′-flanking region (nucleotides −1342 to +94 in Ref. 24Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the TSG-6 gene was amplified from two genomic DNA samples (identified by ARMS analysis as being homozygous AA or homozygous GG, respectively, at position 431) using 5′-CTCTTTTGCAACAAACTTAAATTCAC-3′ and 5′-GTAAATTAAGATGATCATATCGTCAG-3′ forward and reverse primers. These products were sequenced using both amplification oligonucleotides and four internal primers, two on each strand (sense: 5′-GGAAGCAATTTGAGACCAAAAGTAG-3′ and 5′-AAAGCAGGCAGAGAATAAGGAAGTC-3′; antisense: 5′-TGTCTTCAAATATCCCAAACTTTCC-3′ and 5′-TTTGCAGTGTCAATTATGGGATATG-3′).

Association analysis was performed on a proband/spouse case-control cohort; all cases (probands) were ascertained through the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford. Cases had undergone total joint replacement of the hip and/or the knee for primary OA. Patients who underwent total joint replacement secondary to other factors, such as fracture or RA, were excluded. The primary status was supported by clinical, radiological, operative, and histological findings and has been described in detail elsewhere (25Chapman K. Mustafa Z. Irven C. Carr A.J. Clipsham K. Smith A. Chitnavis J. Sinsheimer J.S. Bloomfield V.A. McCartney M. Cox O. Cardon L.R. Sykes B. Loughlin J. Am. J. Hum.

Controls (spouses) had not undergone any joint-replacement surgery or required clinical treatment for OA. During ascertainment, if a spouse had any evidence of symptomatic OA, then that spouse and their affected partner (the case) were excluded from the study. In this way, we identified a case group of severely affected individuals and an age-matched control group in which clinical OA had a very low frequency. All cases and controls were of Caucasian origin and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.Table IDetails of cases and controls used in genotypingTotalSexJoint replacedFemales (F)Males (M)1-aF, female; M, male.F-hipF-kneeF-hip and kneeM-hipM-kneeM-hip and kneeCases400243157167631399508Controls400157243000000Number of cases and controls studied with both groups stratified according to sex and with the cases stratified according to joint replacement.1-a F, female; M, male.

The SNP (at nucleotide 431) does not affect a restriction site. Thus, to create a restriction site we designed a PCR forward primer that spanned nucleotides 396–430 of human TSG-6 (1Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) in which a change from A to C was introduced at position 428. Therefore, the PCR product from the G431 allele contains a BstUI site (CGCG) whereas the product from the A431 allele does not, which allows the SNP to be typed by BstUI restriction analysis; there are no native BstUI sites in this region of the TSG-6 sequence. The sequence of the forward primer is 5′-ACGATAAAGGAGTGTGGTGGCGTCTTTACAGATCCAACGC-3′; the engineered change is indicated in boldface, whereas the underlined portion represents a sequence that was added to balance the number of AT to CG nucleotides. The reverse primer is the same as that used in the ARMS analysis. PCR amplification was performed as described above for the radiation hybrid analysis except that a final concentration of 2 mm MgCl2 and an annealing temperature of 58 °C were used. The amplified product was digested with BstUI (New England BioLabs), using the manufacturer’s recommended conditions, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 3% (w/v) agarose gel. A heterozygous individual was always included in each set of samples to verify that the restriction enzyme was active. Allele and genotype distributions between cases and controls were compared by χ2 using standard contingency table analysis. For each stratification analysis, female cases were compared with female controls and male cases with male controls. The full-length coding sequence of human TSG-6 (A431 allele encoding Gln at amino acid 144), including the signal sequence and stop codon, was excised from the pAcCL29–1 vector by digestion with KpnI/XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the Drosophila Expression System (DES) vector pMT/V5-His B (Invitrogen). This plasmid (designated pDES_TSG6_Q; verified as having the expected DNA sequence) was used to generate a second DES vector, representing the G431 allele (encoding Arg at residue 144), by mutagenesis using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see Refs. 16Mahoney D.J.

Purif. 1996; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutation primer (5′-AGATCCAAAGCGAATTTTTAAATCTC-3′; mutated residue in boldface) and selection primer (5′-AGAGGGCCCTAGGTTCGAAGG-3′), which changes a uniqueSacII site in the polylinker of the DES vector toAvrII (underlined), were both synthesized with 5′-phosphate groups. A DES plasmid containing the desired mutation and no other changes was identified by DNA sequencing and denoted pDES_TSG6_R. Stable transfectants were generated for each of the two DES plasmids by cotransfection of Schneider 2 cells (a cell line derived fromDrosophila melanogaster (39Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar)) with a vector carrying the hygromycin B resistance gene (pCoHygro) and hygromycin B-resistant cells were selected as a stable polyclonal population following the manufacturer’s instructions. Heterologous protein expression was induced by adding CuSO4 to a final concentration of 500 μm ∼5 h after cells had been transferred into serum-free medium. Culture supernatants (900 ml) were harvested after 66 h and clarified by centrifugation. To these 20 ml of 50% (v/v) SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, were added and incubated for 20 min, then washed twice with the acetate buffer. The SP-Sepharose (in a sintered column) was washed with 50 ml of acetate buffer, and the recombinant protein was eluted with 5 × 10 ml of 20 mm MES·HCl, pH 6.5, 500 mm NaCl. Fractions 2 and 3 were combined and then loaded onto a Phenomenex 250 × 10-mm Jupiter C5 column (300 Å, 5 μm) equilibrated in 20% (v/v) solvent B (80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) in solvent A (0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Initial conditions were maintained for 10 min, and then the protein was eluted by linear gradients of 20–55, 55–80, 80–95% B (in A) over 10, 20, and 5 min, respectively. The absorbance at 277 nm was monitored continuously, and TSG-6 was collected manually. The TSG-6 allotypes were then lyophilized, resuspended in water (at 1 mg/ml), and stored at −20 °C; the protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis as described previously (16Mahoney D.J.

The HA-binding activities of the purified recombinant TSG-6 allotypes (human TSG-6R and TSG-6Q) were compared using a colorimetric assay that measures the binding of biotinylated-HA (12.5 ng/well) to protein-coated microtiter plates (0.25–32 pmol/well) at pH 6.0, as described previously (16Mahoney D.J.

All absorbance measurements (405 nm) were corrected by subtracting values from uncoated control wells.

We previously reported the first x-ray structure of an inosine-adenosine-guanosine preferring nucleoside hydrolase (IAG-NH) from Trypanosoma vivax (1). Here we report the 2.0-A crystal structure of the slow D10A mutant in complex with the inhibitor 3-deaza-adenosine and the 1.6-A crystal structure of the same enzyme in complex with a genuine substrate inosine. The enzyme-substrate complex shows the substrate bound to the enzyme in a different conformation from 3-deaza-adenosine and provides a snapshot along the reaction coordinate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The chemical groups on the substrate important for binding and catalysis are mapped. The 2′-OH, 3′-OH, and 5′-OH contribute 4.6, 7.5, and 5.4 kcal/mol to k cat/K m, respectively. Specific interactions with the exocyclic groups on the purine ring are not required for catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the purine specificity of the IAG-NHs is imposed by a parallel aromatic stacking interaction involving Trp83 and Trp260. The pH profiles of k cat andk cat/K m indicate the existence of one or more proton donors, possibly involved in leaving group activation. However, mutagenesis of the active site residues around the nucleoside base and an alanine scan of a flexible loop near the active site fail to identify this general acid. The parallel aromatic stacking seems to provide the most likely alternative mechanism for leaving group activation."

Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In 1998, McLatchie et al. (2.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ligand binding of a GPCR, namely calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), depends on association with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMP). CRLR, originally identified as an orphan GPCR, was shown to form a high affinity receptor to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), when associated with RAMP1, or, to specifically bind adrenomedullin (AM), when associated with RAMP2 or RAMP3. RAMP are type I transmembrane proteins that share ∼30% of amino acids identity and a common predicted topology with the short cytoplasmic C termini, one transmembrane domain, and the large extracellular N termini that are responsible for the acquisition of the RAMP-specific receptor phenotypes (3.Fraser N.J.

Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The discovery of RAMP has demonstrated that ligand-GPCR interaction may require accessory proteins that are either directly involved in the formation of receptor-binding pockets or participate in the acquisition by their partner receptor of specific conformations required for ligand binding. More recently, a second GPCR, namely calcitonin receptor (CTR), was demonstrated to form heterodimeric complexes with RAMP. CTR/RAMP1 and CTR/RAMP3 heterodimers revealed the pharmacological profiles of receptors specific to amylin (6.Christopoulos G. Perry K.J. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Gao Y. Fraser N.J. Main M.J.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2924-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This finding, as well as the ubiquitous and abundant RAMP expression across tissues, suggested that RAMP might be involved in defining functional properties of different GPCRs. However, the direct evidence for RAMP interaction with GPCRs other than CRLR and CTR is still lacking.The molecular mechanisms that guide the processes of assembly, intracellular trafficking, and cell surface expression of RAMP with their partner receptors remain poorly understood. Several studies performed in HEK293T cells suggested that CRLR-RAMP heterodimerization is required for CRLR plasma membrane targeting (2.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar, 3.Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that RAMP play the role of molecular chaperones for CRLR cell surface expression. However, Kuwasako et al. (8.Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and Hilairet et al. (9.Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have respectively reported that when expressed alone, a significant number of RAMP3 or CRLR reach the cell surface of HEK293T cells. Buhlmann et al. (10.Buhlmann N. Aldecoa A. Leuthauser K. Gujer R. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in the embryonic kidney TSA cells CRLR is efficiently expressed at the cell surface with or without RAMP. This apparent discrepancy was attributed to endogenous CRLR and RAMP expression detected in several of the commonly used mammalian expression systems, including HEK293T cells (2.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar, 8.Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M.

However, the fact that cell surface expression of CTR, a second established RAMP partner, does not require RAMP co-transfection suggested that the proposed hypothesis requires further confirmation.In the present study, we assessed the respective roles of CRLR and RAMP in cell surface expression of CRLR/RAMP receptors by using a binding assay allowing quantitative detection of CRLR or RAMP at the cell surface. This assay is based on binding of an iodinated antibody of known specific activity to an epitope placed in the extracellular parts of CRLR and RAMP. For these experiments, we took advantage of theXenopus oocyte expression system in which CRLR/RAMP heterodimers are expressed as fully functional receptors for CGRP or AM (2.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar). Importantly, in this expression system, a significant interaction with endogenously expressed CRLR and/or RAMP can be excluded (see below). Using this assay, we show that assembly in heterodimers is not a prerequisite for cell surface expression of CRLR, whereas RAMP are efficiently transported to the plasma membrane only whenN-glycosylated. Transport of nonglycosylated RAMP can, however, be restored by co-expression with CRLR. This was also true for co-transport to the cell surface of RAMP with CTR but not with several other GPCR tested, thus providing evidence: (i) for the primary role of GPCRs in trafficking of GPCR/RAMP heterodimers to the cell surface, (ii) for the critical role of N-glycosylation for trafficking RAMP to the cell surface and, (iii) for a selective association of RAMP with CRLR and CTR.RESULTSTo assess the respective roles of CRLR and RAMP in cell surface expression of CRLR/RAMP heterodimers, we have developed a quantitative assay based on the binding of 125I-labeled M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody directed against a FLAG reporter epitope introduced into the extracellular N termini of the mouse CRLR, RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). To ensure that the insertion of a FLAG epitope did not significantly change the function of CRLR/RAMP heterodimers, we measured the CGRP- and AM-stimulated currents generated by the CFTR, a cAMP-activated chloride channel. CFTR was co-injected in the Xenopus oocytes with either wild-type or FLAG-tagged CRLR and/or RAMP, and the effector concentrations for half-maximal response (EC50) for CGRP and AM were determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the CRLR-FLAG/RAMP1wt and CRLRwt/RAMP1-FLAG heterodimers have the EC50 values of 28 ± 9 pm (n = 4) and 56 ± 10 pm (n = 5), respectively, not different from that observed for the CRLRwt/RAMP1wt heterodimers (67 ± 17 pm, n = 5). Similarly, the presence of FLAG, did not change the EC50 values for AM (Fig. 1 B) of the CRLRwt/RAMP2-FLAG (477 ± 61 pm,n = 4) and CRLRwt/RAMP3-FLAG (653 ± 419 pm, n = 3) heterodimers, as compared with the CRLRwt/RAMP2wt (339 ± 47 pm, n = 3) and CRLRwt/RAMP3wt (244 ± 151 pm,n = 4) heterodimers, respectively. Importantly, the oocytes injected with CRLR alone have no detectable CGRP- or AM-induced Cl− currents (data not shown), thus ruling out a significant interaction with endogenously expressed RAMP. Also, the absolute CFTR current values were not significantly different between the combinations of either wild-type or FLAG-tagged CRLR and RAMP (data not shown), indicating that neither ligand affinities nor efficiency of membrane targeting are modified by FLAG insertion.The respective roles of CRLR and RAMP in transport to the cell surface of CRLR/RAMP heterodimers were assessed in two sets of experiments in which we compared the cell surface expression of CRLR, RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 expressed either individually or in combinations. In the first group, the cell surface expression of FLAG-tagged CRLR expressed with or without wild-type RAMP was compared. As shown in Fig. 2 A, CRLR is efficiently expressed at the cell surface without RAMP (1.72 ± 0.23 fmol/oocyte, n = 85), and co-expression with either RAMP1, RAMP2 or RAMP3 did not change the cell surface expression level of CRLR (1.56 ± 0.22 fmol/oocyte (n = 54) for CRLR/RAMP1, 1.97 ± 0.34 fmol/oocyte (n = 56) for CRLR/RAMP2, and 1.69 ± 0.22 fmol/oocyte (n = 89) for CRLR/RAMP3, not significantly different from CRLR expressed alone). In the second group, the cell surface expression of FLAG-tagged RAMP1, RAMP2, and RAMP3 expressed with or without wild-type CRLR was compared. As shown in Fig. 2 B, RAMP2 and RAMP3 are transported to the cell surface without CRLR (0.61 ± 0.16 fmol/oocyte (n = 55) and 0.51 ± 0.10 fmol/oocyte (n = 86), respectively), whereas RAMP1 cell surface expression was at a nearly undetectable level (0.14 ± 0.19 fmol/oocyte (n = 46)). Co-expression of RAMP with CRLR leads to efficient transport to the plasma membrane of RAMP1 (2.17 ± 0.39 fmol/oocyte (n = 37), p < 0.001 as compared with RAMP1 expressed alone) and increases to some extent but significantly RAMP2 and RAMP3 cell surface expression (1.39 ± 0.40 fmol/oocyte (n = 57),p < 0.05 and 0.75 ± 0.07 fmol/oocyte (n = 84), p < 0.05 as compared with RAMP2 and RAMP3 expressed alone, respectively). These experiments show that: (i) assembly in heterodimers is not a prerequisite for efficient cell surface expression of CRLR, (ii) RAMP1 is transported to the plasma membrane only upon formation of heterodimers with CRLR and, (iii) individually expressed RAMP2 and RAMP3 are transported to the plasma membrane, but their maximal cell surface expression requires association with CRLR.Figure 2Respective roles of CRLR and RAMP in cell surface expression of CRLR/RAMP heterodimers.

Albiston A. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because the N-glycosylation has been shown to play a variety of roles, including facilitating protein trafficking to the plasma membrane (14.Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that N-glycosylation of RAMP2 or RAMP3 was the basis for the observed difference between RAMP1 and RAMP2 or RAMP3. To assess the role of N-glycosylation in RAMP2 and RAMP3 cell surface expression, we eliminated the fourN-glycosylation consensus sites present in both RAMP2 and RAMP3 mouse proteins by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”) and compared the cell surface expression of wild-type and mutant RAMP2 and RAMP3. As shown on Fig. 3 A, the RAMP2-Δ4NN-glycosylation mutant is expressed at the cell surface at a nearly undetectable level (0.15 ± 0.02 fmol/oocyte (n = 95) for RAMP2-Δ4N as compared with 1.73 ± 0.14 fmol/oocyte (n = 91) for wild-type RAMP2,p < 0.001). Importantly, co-expression of RAMP2-Δ4N with CRLR completely restored the cell surface expression of this mutant (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, RAMP3-Δ4NN-glycosylation mutant is not transported to the cell surface (0.09 ± 0.02 fmol/oocyte (n = 85) for RAMP3-Δ4N as compared with 1.93 ± 0.16 fmol/oocyte (n = 85) for wild-type RAMP3, p < 0.001), and co-expression of this mutant with CRLR partially restored its cell surface expression (Fig. 3 B). The cell surface expression of single N-glycosylation mutants of RAMP2 or RAMP3 was significantly decreased by more than 50% (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (Fig. 3 C) performed on oocytes injected with either wild-type or mutant RAMP confirmed that RAMP2 and RAMP3 areN-glycosylated. Importantly, wild-type and mutant RAMP are expressed at a similar level, thus indicating that the loss of cell surface expression of RAMP2-Δ4N and RAMP3-Δ4N was not due to decreased protein stability or degradation of the mutants. Thus, these experiments show that: (i) cell surface expression of both wild-type RAMP2 and RAMP3 requires the N-glycosylation, (ii) similarly to RAMP1, RAMP2-Δ4N and RAMP3-Δ4N mutants require CRLR for their cell surface expression, and (iii) co-transport to the cell surface expression of RAMP1, RAMP2-Δ4N, and RAMP3-Δ4N with their partner receptors can be used as a stringent test for GPCR-RAMP heterodimerization.Figure 3Cell surface expression of RAMP2-Δ4N and RAMP3-Δ4NN-glycosylation mutants requires CRLR co-expression. A, 5 ng of FLAG-tagged RAMP2, RAMP2-Δ4N, and wild-type CRLR were injected in the Xenopusoocytes. The oocytes were then incubated 36 h at 19 °C, and CRLR cell surface expression was determined by the binding of125I-labeled anti-FLAG antibody. Shown are the means ± S.E. of four to eight experiments performed with 12 oocytes/experimental condition. **, statistical significance < 0.001. B, 5 ng of FLAG-tagged RAMP3, RAMP3-Δ4N, and wild-type CRLR were injected in the Xenopus oocytes. The oocytes were then incubated 36 h at 19 °C, and CRLR cell surface expression was determined by binding of125I-labeled anti-FLAG antibody. Shown are the means ± S.E. of four to eight experiments performed with 12 oocytes/experimental condition. *, statistical significance < 0.05. C, RAMP1 and wild-type or N-glycosylation mutants of RAMP2 and RAMP3 were immunoprecipitated from the metabolically [35S]methionine-labeled Xenopusoocytes after 12 h of mRNA injection (5 ng). As predicted from the protein sequence, RAMP1 is expressed with an apparent molecular mass of ∼14 kDa. N-Glycosylated RAMP2 and RAMP3 are expressed with apparent molecular masses of 33 kDa and 22, 25, and 27 kDa, respectively. RAMP2-Δ4N and RAMP3-Δ4N are expressed with apparent molecular masses of 17 and 14 kDa, as predicted for apparent molecular masses of nonglycosylated RAMP2 and RAMP3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further assess the possibility that N-glycosylation of RAMP2 and RAMP3 may be the basis of the observed difference between RAMP1 and RAMP2/RAMP3 cell surface expression, we took advantage that three of four of the N-glycosylation sites of RAMP2 and RAMP3 are within the partially conserved stretches of amino acid that are also present in RAMP1 (Fig. 4 A). We therefore introducedN-glycosylation sites in the sequence of RAMP1 (D58N/G60S, Y71N, or K103N/P105S) and examined their cell surface expression. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the three mutants were able to traffic to the cell surface unlike wild-type RAMP1. For two mutants (RAMP1-Y71N and RAMP1-K103N/P105S), the level of cell surface expression of RAMP was equal or superior to that of the RAMP1/CRLR heterocomplexes. We next verified that the mutated RAMP1s were indeedN-glycosylated. As shown in Fig. 4 C, wild-type RAMP1 was, as expected, not glycosylated, whereas RAMP1(Y71N) and RAMP1(K103N/P105S) were. Interestingly, the RAMP1-D58N/G60S mutant was only partially N-glycosylated, and its cell surface expression level reached only ∼40% of that of Y71N and K103N/P105S mutants (Fig. 4 B). This experiment confirms the critical importance of N-glycosylation for cell surface expression of the RAMP proteins.Figure 4Insertion of N-glycosylation consensus sites promotes RAMP1 cell surface expression.

C, RAMP1 wild-type and RAMP1-D58N/G60S, RAMP1-Y71S, and RAMP1-K103N/P105S mutants were immunoprecipitated from the metabolically [35S]methionine-labeled Xenopus oocytes after 12 h of mRNA injection (5 ng). InsertedN-glycosylation consensus sites are partially (RAMP1-D58N/G60S mutant) or completely (RAMP1-Y71S and RAMP1-K103N/P105S mutants) used, as demonstrated by PNGase F treatment.

The aim of these experiments was 2-fold: (i) to check the selectivity of RAMP association to different GPCRs and (ii) to compare the role of other RAMP partners in trafficking to the cell surface of GPCR/RAMP heterodimers. We have chosen three receptors that share a high degree of amino acids homology with CRLR, namely CTR (∼65% homologous), PTH/PTHrP-R (∼45% homologous), and GluR (∼45% homologous) and two GPCRs that do not exhibit the significant degree of homology with CRLR, namely, vasopressin V1aR and V2R. As shown in Fig. 5 (A–C), in addition to CRLR, only CTR was able to co-transport to the cell surface the RAMP1, RAMP2-Δ4N, and RAMP3-Δ4N, despite the similar levels of protein expression observed for all receptors (data not shown). These data, as well as previous observations that individually expressed PTH/PTHrP-R, GluR, V1aR, and V2R are efficiently targeted to the cell surface of theXenopus oocytes (18.Horiuchi T.

As an additional test, we co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged RAMP1 with co-expressed wild-type receptors, using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 D, RAMP1 is physically associated only with CRLR and CTR but not with other receptors, thus confirming the data of cell surface binding analysis. These experiments show that among tested receptors RAMP selectively associates with CRLR and CTR and that, similar to CRLR, CTR is responsible for the efficient RAMP trafficking to the cell surface.Figure 5RAMP selectively associate with CRLR and CTR. 5 ng of FLAG-tagged RAMP1 (A and D), RAMP2-Δ4N (B), and RAMP3-Δ4N (C) were co-injected with 5 ng of either wild-type CRLR, CTR, PTH/PTHrP-R, GluR, V1aR, or V2R. The oocytes were then incubated 36 h at 19 °C, and RAMP1 (A), RAMP2-Δ4N (B), or RAMP3-Δ4N (C) cell surface expression was determined by the binding of125I-labeled anti-FLAG antibody.

(2.McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar) proposed that RAMP play the role of molecular chaperones required for CRLR cell surface expression and that association with RAMP results in differentialN-glycosylation of CRLR. The fully glycosylated mature form of CRLR in CRLR/RAMP1 heterodimer and the core-glycosylated immature forms of CRLR in CRLR/RAMP2 and CRLR/RAMP3 heterodimers have been proposed as specific CGRP or AM receptors, respectively. However, further studies performed by Aldecoa et al. (22.Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and by Hilairet et al.

Similarly, several studies in which a significant amount of individually expressed CRLR or RAMP was detected at the cell surface have indicated that the chaperone function of RAMP should be reevaluated (8.Kuwasako K.

We and others have previously used a similar approach to study the process of assembly and trafficking to the plasma membrane of the α-β-γ subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (11.Firsov D.

This study aims to address the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena using the in vitro assembly of 48 S preinitiation complexes from fully purified translational components in the presence or absence of p50 as analyzed by the toeprint assay. With limited concentrations of eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4F, p50 (but not pyrimidine tract-binding protein, which was taken for comparison) strongly stimulates formation of the 48 S preinitiation complexes with β-globin mRNA. This stimulation is observed when just a few molecules of p50 are bound per molecule of the mRNA. When the amount of p50 in solution is increased over some threshold p50/mRNA ratio, a remarkable repression is observed that can still be relieved by adding more eIF2 and eIF4F. At even higher concentrations of p50, the inhibitory effect becomes irreversible. The threshold ratio depends upon the extent of secondary structure of the 5′-untranslated region linked to the β-globin coding region. Chemical probing has confirmed that the binding of p50 to mRNA involves only the sugar-phosphate backbone of the mRNA leaving nucleotide bases free for interaction with other messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) components. These data are best compatible with the functional role of p50 as a “manager” of mRNA-protein interactions in mammalian mRNPs. p50, the major core protein bound to mammalian mRNAs, has been reported to stimulate translation at low p50/mRNA ratios and inhibit translation at high p50/mRNA ratios.

The 70-kDa protein (poly(A)-binding protein) is bound to the poly(A) tail of mRNA and is the most widely studied mRNP to date, both structurally and functionally (2Gallie D.R.

According to its amino acid sequence and affinity for DNA, p50 was identified as a member of the family of cold shock domain-containing proteins that is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to man (6Evdokimova V.M.

In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown earlier that p50 strongly inhibits translation of exogenous mRNA in cell-free translation systems (12Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P.

InXenopus oocytes, two proteins closely related to p50 were reported to be responsible for the masked state of mRNA (15Richter J.D. Smith L.D.

Therefore, it is conceivable that mammalian p50 plays a similar role thereby determining the level of translational repression of mRNAs. However, we have demonstrated that p50 not only inhibits but also stimulates translation depending on the p50/mRNA ratio in a cell-free system (12Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with the use of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate depleted of p50 with specific antibodies. The p50-depleted lysate showed a low translational activity, whereas addition of p50 partially restored the level of polypeptide synthesis. We have also shown that p50 exerts its effect at the level of translation initiation rather than at the level of elongation or termination of polypeptide synthesis (20Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms at play, additional experimentation in a more defined system is required. In addition, the depleted lysate system did not allow us to judge which step of translation initiation was stimulated or inhibited by the protein. In this report, we present experiments designed to address the molecular mechanisms of the action of p50 on translation initiation using the in vitro assembly of 48 S preinitiation complexes from purified translational components in the presence of different amounts of p50. The yield of reconstituted complexes was monitored by the toeprint assay (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). It was found that p50 affects translation initiation at the level of 48 S preinitiation complex formation. At a low p50/mRNA ratio, the protein stimulates binding of 40 S ribosomal subunits to the initiation triplet of β-globin mRNA. This stimulation was specific for p50 rather than a common feature of cytoplasmic mRNA-binding proteins. At p50 concentrations exceeding some threshold p50/mRNA ratio, a remarkable repression is observed, the threshold ratio being dependent on the secondary structure of the 5′-untranslated region linked to the β-globin coding region. Native globin mRNAs were isolated from rabbit reticulocyte polysomes washed with 0.5 m KCl. Total RNA was phenol-extracted from 1000 A260units of the salt-washed ribosomes, and poly(A+) RNA was isolated with the use of a poly(A+) RNA isolation kit (Amersham Biosciences). The mRNA was then layered on a 5–20% sucrose gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS and centrifuged at 4 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) for 15 h at 35,000 rpm. The material from the 9 S region of the gradient was pooled, and the globin mRNA was precipitated with ethanol. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed no contamination of the globin mRNA with ribosomal RNA. The isolated material represented a mixture of α- and β-globin mRNAs. These RNAs behave similarly in reconstitution of 48 S preinitiation complexes and have a similar size (22Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In this study, the 48 S preinitiation complex was analyzed only for formation of the 48 S preinitiation complex with β-globin mRNA. [32P]β-Globin mRNA was synthesized in vitro by a T3 transcription reaction using the plasmid pβ-Glo linearized with SacI. pβ-Glo represented a β-globin cDNA inserted between theHindIII and SacI sites of the plasmid pBS (Stratagene). (CAA)n-β-globin mRNA was obtained by T7 transcription of plasmid p(CAA)n-βGlo linearized withSacI. The plasmid was constructed by replacement of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) coding region in the p(CAA)n-GUS vector at the NcoI site with the β-globin coding region produced using PCR. p(CAA)n-GUS vector was a gift of Dr. I.V. Boni (Moscow, Russia). 40 S ribosomal subunits and factors eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4F were prepared from rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described previously (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 24Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Recombinant eIF4A and eIF4B were purified as described elsewhere (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recombinant eIF1 was prepared from cells transfected with the expression plasmid pET-8c (Novagen) containing the coding sequence of eIF1 (25Kasperaitis M.A.M. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TheEscherichia coli cells with the recombinant plasmid were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and after 5 h at 23 °C were sonicated and clarified with a low speed centrifugation, and a 40–70% ammonium sulfate fraction was prepared from the supernatant. The dialyzed proteins were applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (buffer A100). The flow-through was applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences), and eIF1 resolved at this step was concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A100. The eIF1A expression plasmid and factor eIF1A were prepared exactly as described by Pestova et al. (22Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), starting from the eIF1A cDNA-containing plasmid kindly provided by Dr. John Hershey. Purification of PTB and p50 was as described previously (20Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Hellen C.U.T. Pestova T.V. Litterst M. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both mRNA-binding proteins were purified to homogeneity using RNA affinity columns as the last step of purification. [35S]Methionine-labeled Met-tRNAiMet was prepared using calf liver total tRNA (Novagen, Madison, WI) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase isolated from E. coli MRE600 as described previously (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Ribosomal 48 S preinitiation complexes were assembled as described earlier (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 22Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), but the amounts of initiation factors eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4F were decreased. In this study, 0.2 μg (∼1 pmol) of native globin mRNA was incubated with eIF1 (0.5 μg), eIF1A (0.5 μg), eIF2 (0.9 μg), eIF3 (1.2 μg), eIF4F (0.2 μg), eIF4A (0.5 μg), eIF4B (0.3 μg), Met-tRNAiMet (1.5 pmol), and 40 S subunits (5 pmol) in a reaction volume of 20 μl for 10 min at 30 °C. p50 and PTB were included in some reaction mixtures as described in the text. 48 S complexes were analyzed by primer extension as described previously (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 22Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) using primer 5′-TCACCACCAACTTCTTCCAC-3′ or 5′-CACATTCATTCACCTTGC-3′ complementary to nt 114–133 or nt 103–120 of the rabbit β-globin mRNA sequence, respectively. Electrophoresis of cDNAs was performed by denaturing 6% PAGE. Radioactive bands were visualized, and relative amounts of radioactivity in the bands were determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The sugar-phosphate backbone of the RNA in the p50·β-globin mRNA binary complexes was probed with Fe(II)·EDTA according to the protocol described for the modification of ribosomal complexes (27Huttenhofer A. Noller H.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3892-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These complexes were formed in the buffer used for reconstitution of the 48 S preinitiation complexes. β-Globin mRNA was synthesized in vitrowith T3 polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP as described previously (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The RNA was freed of unincorporated [α-32P]UTP by gel filtration, and its specific radioactivity was determined by A260 and Cerenkov counting. Finally the integrity of the RNA was confirmed by denaturing 6% PAGE. The 32P-labeled β-globin mRNA (5 pmol) was incubated with the corresponding amounts of all other translation initiation components under conditions of the 48 S complex formation (see above) with addition of 150 pmol of p50 (p50/mRNA ratio = 30). The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C and layered on a 5–20% sucrose gradient prepared in the reconstitution buffer. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 19 h at 33,000 rpm, the mRNP peak was isolated. The RNA content of the mRNP peak was determined by Cerenkov counting, and 60-μl aliquots along with different amounts of p50 were subjected to 10% PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes under semidry conditions (Semi-Phor, Hoefer Scientific Instruments), and then membranes were processed as described earlier (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) using polyclonal rabbit p50 antiserum diluted 5000-fold (20Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Bands were revealed using an ECL system. After scanning the bands, the amount of p50 in the aliquots of the mRNA peak was determined using the calibration plot obtained from control bands of p50 (run on the same gel, see above). For the reconstitution assay we used a set of purified canonical initiation factors (eIF1, eIF1A, eIF2, eIF3, eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B), reticulocyte 40 S ribosomal subunits, total calf liver tRNA where only the initiator tRNA was charged with methionine, native globin mRNA, and p50 (added to this system in varying amounts). After a short incubation, a primer and reverse transcriptase were added to the mixture, and the length of cDNAs resulting from primer extension were determined. The influence of p50 on assembly of the 48 S preinitiation complex was quantitatively estimated by the intensity of toeprint bands at positions +16 to +18 downstream from the AUG initiation triplet. It has been well established that the arrest of reverse transcriptase occurs at positions +16 to +18 (toeprint bands) only when the initiator tRNA forms a codon-anticodon interaction with the mRNA initiation triplet in the P-site of the 40 S ribosomal subunit or 80 S ribosome (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 28Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 29Anthony D.D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1554-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No arrest of primer extension at these positions occurs when the initiator tRNA is absent from the 40 S ribosomal subunit or 80 S ribosome. No effect of p50 was found using published protocols (21Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 22Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) for assembly of 48 S preinitiation complexes (data not shown). However, when the concentration of eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4F was reduced about 3-fold resulting in 7, 2, and 0.8 pmol/1 pmol of mRNA, up to a 4-fold stimulation by p50 was observed on the yield of 48 S preinitiation complexes (Fig. 1). (It should be noted that the yield of 48 S complexes was quantitated as the percentage of toeprint radioactivity to the total radioactivity in the same lane. In this way, any variation caused by positive or negative effects of p50 on the transcription reaction itself were excluded.) Similar toeprint results were obtained when using the primer 5′-CACATTCATTCACCTTCG-3′ (data not shown). Its annealing site is separated from the toeprint nucleotides by just 32 nucleotide residues. Stimulation was observed before the p50/mRNA ratio exceeded 30 (Fig. 1, lane 6). When the amount of p50 was further increased 2-fold, a repression of 48 S complex formation was evident (Fig. 1, lane 7). This inhibitory effect could be relieved by adding more of initiation factors eIF4F and eIF2 (Fig.2, lanes 4, 5, and8). The strongest effect was demonstrated for initiation factor eIF2 (Fig. 2, lane 8), whereas excess eIF3 was slightly inhibitory (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7). A further increase of the p50/mRNA ratio to 100 resulted in even greater suppression of 48 S complex formation, and addition of the same amounts of initiation factors (eIF2 or eIF4F) as indicated for Fig. 2 did not relieve this inhibition (data not shown). As has been shown by Pestova et al. (22Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), omission of initiation factors eIF1 and eIF1A from the reconstitution mixture results in formation of an aberrant 5′-terminal initiation complex. To be formed, this aberrant complex still requires all of the other translation initiation components including Met-tRNAiMet. Although this complex is not an intermediate of the true 48 S initiation complex, it was of interest to see whether p50 was able to stimulate ribosome binding per se or whether it acted only when all factors required for scanning to the start codon are present. In this way, one can get an idea whether p50, known to have prominent RNA unwinding characteristics (23Skabkin M.A. Evdokimova V. Thomas A.A. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44841-44847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is involved in unwinding secondary structure of the 5′-leader of β-globin mRNA during the scanning process. As seen from Fig. 3 (lanes 1 and 2), omission of eIF1 and eIF1A resulted in appearance of the aberrant 5′-terminal initiation complex with concomitant disappearance of the authentic 48 S initiation complex. Addition of increasing amounts of p50 to this reconstitution mixture demonstrates stimulation of the 5′-terminal complex formation up to the same threshold p50/mRNA ratio = 30 as was found before for the authentic 48 S complex (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5). Thus, the stimulation effect is not based, at least entirely, on involvement of the protein in the scanning process of the 5′-leader of β-globin mRNA. One may suspect that any mRNA-binding protein with highly basic domains would promote assembly of the 48 S complex in the manner demonstrated above for p50. If so, the stimulation effect would be regarded as nonspecific. In this regard, one may recall an example of this kind: general RNA-binding proteins, as different as hnRNPA1, La autoantigen, PTB, and p50, all render translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate more cap-dependent irrespective of their cellular function and individual characteristics (30Svitkin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Dreyfuss G. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7147-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To check this possibility, effects of the highly basic mRNA-binding protein PTB and p50 were compared in parallel assays of the 48 S preinitiation complex formation. As can be seen in Fig. 4, PTB does not stimulate the formation of the 48 S complex with β-globin mRNA; in fact, its addition is inhibitory. This is in agreement with our previous report that PTB did not stimulate translation of β-globin mRNA in PTB-depleted cell extracts (31Borovjagin A.V. Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At higher concentrations, PTB strongly inhibited not only formation of the 48 S complex but also the reverse transcription reaction as seen by the decrease of full-length product of primer extension (Fig. 4,lanes 6–9, upper bands). Presumably PTB interferes with either annealing of a primer to the mRNA chain or elongation of the cDNA product or both by virtue of its interaction with nucleotide bases (pyrimidines). In contrast, p50 does not inhibit the reverse transcription reaction (the yield of the full-length product) even at the p50/mRNA ratio of about 100 or more (when formation of 48 S complexes is strongly repressed; Fig. 2 and data not shown). Nucleotide bases appear to remain exposed in solution and available for interaction with RNA or protein components of translational machinery. As follows from the results presented above, p50 does not inhibit reverse transcription even at high p50/mRNA ratios. These observations and the data reported earlier (6Evdokimova V.M. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Wei C.-L. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggest that p50 does not recognize nucleotide bases of mRNA. Chemical probing of p50·β-globin mRNA complexes confirmed this suggestion. No protection of nucleotide bases was found when p50·mRNA binary complexes were treated with dimethylsulfate (A and C residues) or 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (U residues). At low p50/mRNA ratios, protection of the sugar-phosphate backbone of mRNA from modification with Fe(II)·EDTA complexes was not seen either (data not shown). At a p50/mRNA ratio of about 30, the sites of protection by p50 of the sugar-phosphate backbone are distributed along the whole length of β-globin mRNA with a preference for some sequences of the mRNA (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and4). This preference may be accounted for by different potential for base pairing of different nucleotide sequences. In its turn, this may result in differential p50 binding to different parts of the mRNA. Indeed p50 is known to have a much higher affinity for single-stranded than double-stranded nucleic acids. Fig.6 presents an obvious illustration of this feature. Here the effect of p50 on the 48 S complex assembly is shown for the (CAA)n-β-globin mRNA. This mRNA differs from native β-globin mRNA in its 5′-untranslated region, CAAGAA(CAA)19CACCAUGG. . . . . , which makes up only ∼110 of the entire molecule, and by the absence of a poly(A) tail. As has been shown by Tzareva et al. (32Tzareva N.V. Makhno V.I. Boni I.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the (CAA)n-leader has a 100% single-stranded conformation. It has reduced requirements for some initiation factors and is extremely efficient in the 48 S complex formation. 2T. Pestova, personal communication. With the (CAA)n-β-globin hybrid mRNA, a remarkable inhibition of the toeprint is observed at the p50/mRNA ratio as low as 10 (Fig. 6, lane 2) that is 6-fold lower than the ratio with a similar inhibitory effect for β-globin mRNA (compare with Figs. 1and 2). For the natural β-globin mRNA, a ratio of p50/mRNA of 10 demonstrates a stimulatory rather than an inhibitory effect. These data present compelling evidence that p50 greatly prefers long stretches of unpaired nucleotides. The p50 molecules bound to the (CAA)n-mRNA are concentrated mostly within its long unstructured 5′-leader and, as such, form a local inhibitory complex. In this connection, it is not surprising that no stimulation by p50 of the 48 S complex formation with the (CAA)n-leader is seen at p50/mRNA ratios lower than 10. Apparently any stimulation in this case should be negated by the concomitant inhibitory binding of p50 within the (CAA)n-leader.Figure 6Effect of p50 on the assembly of the 48 S preinitiation complex with (CAA)n-β-globin mRNA. The formation of the complex was analyzed as indicated in Fig. 1. A dideoxynucleotide sequence generated with the same primer (5′-CACCACCAACTTCTTCCAC-3′) is shown at the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To get an idea about the mechanism of action of p50 on the 48 S complex formation, it is useful to know how many molecules of the protein need to be bound to the mRNA to observe an effect. As follows from Figs. 1, 2, and 4, the stimulation is detected even at low p50/mRNA ratios and increases up to some threshold value of about 30 p50 per mRNA after which the yield of the 48 S complexes rapidly decreases. This does not mean, however, that these 30 molecules of p50 are all bound to the mRNA. The experimental conditions for the 48 S complex assembly involve the addition of a large excess of uncharged tRNA that is not participating in the reconstitution process. Although the tRNA has a very low affinity for p50, its high concentration sequesters some p50. This is evident from the sucrose gradient sedimentation of p50·β-globin mRNA complexes in the presence or absence of tRNA. In the latter case, a much heavier mRNP was formed that rapidly sedimented to the bottom of the tube (Fig.7A). Therefore, the number p50 molecules bound to the β-globin mRNA in the presence of a large excess of tRNA was estimated. For this, 32P-labeled mRNA with a known specific activity was incubated in the reconstitution buffer with p50 in the presence of all the translation initiation components needed to form the 48 S preinitiation complex. The mRNA·p50 complex was separated from unbound p50 and tRNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and the amount of mRNA in the mRNP peak was determined by Cerenkov counting. Western blot experiments performed in our laboratory showed that p50 does not dissociate from the mRNA during sucrose gradient centrifugation presumably because of its high affinity for single-stranded polynucleotides (data not shown). This allowed us to use sucrose gradient centrifugation as a technique to separate two pools of p50, the pool bound to mRNA and that sequestered by tRNA. Aliquots from different fractions of the mRNP peak were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE along with a series of known amounts of p50. After transfer of the proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the corresponding bands were developed with an ECL Western blotting system and quantified by densitometric scanning. The immunological response to increasing amounts of p50 was linear in the selected range of p50 used (Fig.7B). In Fig. 7C, the same Western blotting experiment demonstrates a response of p50 antibodies to aliquots from the three different fractions of the p50/mRNA peak. In a series of independent experiments, the p50/mRNA ratio in the mRNP peak varied from 6 to 8. This value represents the average number of p50 molecules bound to the β-globin mRNA at the threshold p50 concentration when stimulation of the translation initiation gives way to its inhibition. We have recently shown that p50 plays not only a negative but also a positive role in translation and that this positive effect is exerted at the level of translational initiation (19Braddock M. Muckenthaler M. White M.R.H. Thorburn A.M. Sommerville J. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, using the reconstitution of the initiation complexes with purified components, we present strong evidence that p50 stimulates the binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit at the initiation codon of mRNA. The stimulation reaches its maximum when less than 10 molecules of p50 are bound per one mRNA molecule of the size of rabbit β-globin mRNA (the length of the mRNA is 589 nt excluding the poly(A) tail that is normally bound to poly(A)-binding protein). On average, this results in a large separation between individual p50 molecules along the polynucleotide chain. It should be stressed that the stimulation can be observed at much lower p50/mRNA ratios (Fig. 1) and, hence, occurs with an average distance of more than 100 nt between bound p50 molecules. With this low occupancy of mRNA, it is not immediately evident how this RNA-binding protein may affect the events that occur at the 5′-end of mRNA. There are two features, however, that distinguish p50 from the overwhelming majority of mRNA-binding proteins studied to date (33Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Gingras A.-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and that may be a key to answer the question. As was reported previously (6Evdokimova V.M. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Wei C.-L. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and confirmed here, the binding of p50 to mRNA does not engage the nucleotide bases. It binds the sugar-phosphate backbone and has no preferred sequence motifs on mRNAs. However, it has a great preference for the sequences with unpaired and probably weakly stacked nucleotide bases. We speculate that these properties primarily target p50 to the most unstructured regions within the mRNA molecules that are presumably also preferred sites for aberrant binding of initiation factors or other mRNA-binding proteins. As nonspecific RNA-protein interactions take place at the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA, p50 efficiently displaces them from the irrelevant sites without interfering with specific interactions that normally involve nucleotide bases. In this way, one may easily imagine why just a few molecules of p50 are able to stimulate translation initiation, the process that is confined to a rather limited region of mRNA nucleotide sequence. The corresponding model that extends the model suggested earlier by Minich and Ovchinnikov (12Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) is presented in Fig.8. The competition between key initiation factors eIF4F and eIF2 and p50 was clearly demonstrated in this study. The inability of p50 to stimulate the assembly of the 48 S complex at high molar excesses of eIF2 and eIF4F is also in line with this interpretation. The model (“competitive model”) describes p50 as a general organizer of RNA-protein interactions in mRNPs. In contrast, another mRNA-binding protein, PTB, fails to promote the binding of 40 S subunits to the start codon of β-globin mRNA. Unlike p50, PTB may be “retained” by pyrimidine-rich sequences of mRNA. It is logical, therefore, that PTB promotes translation initiation only in specific cases (some picornaviruses (34Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 330-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)), and its stimulation effect appears to be of a quite different nature (35Kolupaeva V.G. Hellen C.U.T. Shatsky I.N. RNA. 1996; 2: 1199-1212PubMed Google Scholar). One should bear in mind that p50 possesses prominent RNA unwinding properties (6Evdokimova V.M. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Wei C.-L. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Skabkin M.A. Evdokimova V. Thomas A.A. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44841-44847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This feature presumably also based on its strong affinity to single-stranded sequences may allow p50 to modulate mRNA secondary structure (see Ref. 36Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), thereby facilitating interaction of initiation factors and 40 S ribosomal subunit with the RNA polynucleotide chain. None of the experiments described above excludes this possibility. However, the bulk of evidence presented in this paper offers support for the competitive model. It should be pointed out that the stimulatory effect of p50 on translation initiation at low p50/mRNA ratios and its repressive effect at high p50/mRNA ratios may be based on somewhat different features of p50. Whereas the stimulation is observed under conditions of a large separation between individual molecules of p50 on the polynucleotide chain, its repressive effect becomes prominent when p50 molecules seem to establish protein-protein contacts. This is the most plausible explanation for a remarkable inhibition of the toeprint even at a low p50/mRNA ratio for the (CAA)n-β-globin mRNA. In this case, several molecules of p50 appear to cooperatively bind within the 68-nt single-stranded leader of this artificial mRNA leaving the remaining part of the 5′-untranslated region essentially free of bound protein. This presumably results in transition of mRNP into a locked form (for model, see Ref. 37Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, a natural RNA requires a more complete filling of the polynucleotide chain with p50 molecules to establish cooperative protein-protein interactions. At low p50/mRNA ratios, individual molecules of p50 are still separated by unoccupied structured RNA elements that prevent them from establishing protein-protein contacts. When these protein-protein interactions are finally achieved at the 5′ terminus of the mRNA, they start to compete with initiation factors for binding with the 5′-untranslated leader. In particular, they should interfere with interaction of mRNA-binding domain of eIF4G with the 5′-untranslated region. As a result (see Ref. 38Haghighat A. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21677-21680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the overall affinity of eIF4F to the mRNA will drop with a concomitant easier dissociation of eIF4E from the cap structure. This model offers an alternative explanation of some results recently reported by Evdokimovaet al. (13Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). An intriguing possibility is that some or all types of mammalian cells are able to regulate the general level of protein synthesis just by changing the intracellular concentration of p50. As suggested by the experiment presented in Fig. 6, this may differentially affect expression of mRNAs with unstructured and highly organized 5′-untranslated regions. Studies on the regulation of the synthesis of p50 itself that should clarify this interesting issue are now in progress. We thank Dmitri Kolkevich and Yakov Alexeev for technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W1992645522,"Chromogranins A (CGA) and B (CGB) are two major Ca2+ storage proteins of the secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells. Nevertheless, we found in the present study that CGB was also localized in the nucleus. In immunogold electron microscopy using bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells, it was found that the number of CGB-labeled gold particles localized per μm2 of the nucleus was equivalent to 20% that of CGB-labeled gold particles localized per μm2 of the secretory granules. Considering that CGB is estimated to exist in the 0.1–0.2-mm range in the secretory granules of bovine chromaffin cells, 20% of these amounts to 20–40 μm. In addition, transfection of CGA and CGB into nonneuroendocrine COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells repeatedly indicated the nuclear localization of CGB in addition to its usual localization in the cytoplasm. Moreover, immunoblot and immunogold electron microscopy analyses of neuroendocrine PC12 cells also showed the existence of endogenous CGB in both the cytosol and the nucleus. Nuclear routing of CGB did not appear to depend entirely upon the nuclear localization signal as some of the nuclear localization signal mutant CGB were still targeted to the nucleus. In gene array assay, CGB was shown to either induce or suppress transcription of many genes including those of transcription factors. Of these we have analyzed eight genes, four induced (zinc finger protein, MEF2C, hCRP2, abLIM) and four suppressed (hcKrox, T3-receptor, troponin C, integrin) using the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method and spectrophotometry to determine the transcription levels of each mRNA. CGB was shown to increase the transcription of zinc finger protein, MEF2C, hCRP2, and abLIM by 2.5–5-fold while suppressing that of hcKrox, T3-receptor, troponin C, and integrin by 60–75%. Given that MEF2C and hcKrox genes are transcription factors, these results pointed to the transcription control role of CGB in the nucleus.

Despite the differences in amino acid sequences, chromogranins A and B and secretogranin II (also called chromogranin C) were shown to aggregate in an acidic pH and high calcium environment (16Gerdes H.-H.

Nevertheless, there was a big difference in the pH- and Ca2+-dependent aggregation properties of these two proteins; the aggregation of CGB being at least two orders of magnitude more sensitive to Ca2+ than CGA (20Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12578-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike CGA, which dimerized at pH 7.5 and tetramerized at pH 5.5 (21Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11236-11241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Thiele C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12578-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that CGA and CGB, as well as most of the secretory vesicle matrix proteins, not only aggregated in the presence of Ca2+ at the intravesicular pH 5.5 but also bound to several integral membrane proteins of the secretory granule, including the IP3R (23Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24So S.H. Yoo S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Some of the vesicle matrix proteins that failed to bind to the vesicle membrane were shown to bind instead to CGA, thus ensuring their interaction with the vesicle membrane (25Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, in view of the chromogranins' ability to interact with both the vesicle matrix proteins and the vesicle membrane, the roles of CGA and CGB in the selective aggregation and the sorting of potential vesicle matrix proteins to the secretory granules appear to be essential in secretory granule biogenesis (25Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.-H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, chromogranins A and B have been suggested to play key roles in secretory granule biogenesis (5Iacangelo A. Eiden L.E. Regul. Pept. 1995; 58: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,25Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.-H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It was indeed reported recently that CGA functions as an on/off switch for secretory granule biogenesis in PC12 cells (27Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.-H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Using the antisense RNA technique and PC12 cells, Kim et al.(27Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.-H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) showed that the number of secretory granules formed is directly related to the amount of CGA expressed in PC12 cells. It was further shown that the secretory granule formation could be induced in nonneuroendocrine cells, which normally don't contain any secretory granules, by expressing CGA in these cells.We have extended here the chromogranin study and found that CGB was also localized in the nucleus in addition to its usual presence in the secretory granules. Although other secretory granule resident proteins proenkephalin and corticotrophin-releasing hormone have also been found in the nucleus before (28Böttger A. Spruce B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Castro M.G. Morrison E. Tomasec P. Linton E.A. Lowenstein P.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 282: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), this is the first time the secretory granule marker protein chromogranin is found in the nucleus, opening new possibilities for the role of chromogranin in the nucleus. One of the nuclear roles of CGB appears to be control of the transcription of many genes, including those for transcription factors.RESULTSIn view of the abundant presence of CGA and CGB in the adrenal chromaffin cells, we investigated the possibility of the presence of endogenous CGB in the nucleus of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells using immunogold electron microscopy (Fig.1). As shown in Fig. 1A, the CGA-labeled gold particles were primarily localized in the secretory granules with some in the endoplasmic reticulum. But virtually no CGA-labeling gold particles were found in the mitochondria. In contrast, the CGB-labeled gold particles localized not only in the secretory granules but also in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). Like the result in Fig. 1A, the chromogranin B-labeled gold particles were not found in the mitochondria. In control experiments, omission of the primary antibody or preimmune treatment in place of the primary antibody almost completely eliminated the chromogranin-labeled gold particles (Fig. 1C)To further evaluate the relative abundance of CGB in the nucleus, we examined fifteen different EM images, which had been prepared from seven different tissue samples and counted the total number of CGB-labeled gold particles in the secretory granules, nucleus, and mitochondria (Table I). As shown in TableI, 1027 CGB-labeled gold particles were found in 6.42 μm2of the secretory granule area thus averaging 160 CGB-labeled gold particles per μm2 of the secretory granule area. In the same EM images 636 CGB-labeled gold particles were found in 19.47 μm2 of the nuclear area averaging 33 CGB-labeled gold particles per μm2, whereas 12 gold particles were localized in 3.51 μm2 of mitochondria averaging three gold particles per μm2. In light of the fact that two-three gold particles were consistently found per μm2of adrenal chromaffin cells in the control EM images, the three CGB-labeled gold particles found per μm2 of mitochondria are considered to result from nonspecific interactions.Table IDistribution of the CGA- and CGB-labeled gold particles in bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cellCGACGBNumber of gold particles1-a15 images from five different tissue preparations were used./area viewed (μm2)Gold particles/μm2Number of gold particles1-b15 images from seven different tissue preparations were used./area viewed (μm2)Gold particles/μm2Secretory granule3488 /7.984371027 /6.42160Nucleus40 /13.773636 /19.4733Mitochondria13 /5.28212 /3.5131-a 15 images from five different tissue preparations were used.1-b 15 images from seven different tissue preparations were used. Open table in a new tab Similar to the CGB-immunogold study, fifteen different images from five different tissue samples were also examined for the presence of CGA-labeled gold particles in the secretory granules, nucleus, and mitochondria (Table I). The CGA-labeled gold particles were found virtually in all the secretory granules, averaging 437 CGA-labeled gold particles per μm2 of the secretory granule, whereas 2–3 gold particles each were found per μm2 of the nucleus and of the mitochondria. Again, the two-three gold particles that were found per μm2 of the nucleus or mitochondria are identical to the number of gold particles found in the absence of the primary antibody. This result is in contrast to that obtained with the CGB-labeled gold particles, which clearly demonstrated the presence of CGB in the nucleus.To determine whether transfected CGB can be routed to the nucleus in nonneuroendocrine cells, we have constructed CGA and CGB expression vectors and transfected them into COS-7 cells. The bovine chromogranins A and B that were used in the present experiments are shown in Fig.2A. Two conserved regions (near the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions) are indicated asdashed boxes in Fig. 2A. For the immunolabeling and immunoblotting procedures, we tagged CGA and CGB at the C-terminal ends either with HA and His6, respectively, or with GFP. When chromogranins A and B were introduced into COS-7 cells, the expression of CGA and CGB in the cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using either the tagging peptide-specific or chromogranin-specific antibody, which indicated a normal expression of the transfected chromogranins in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2B). In the cells that had been transfected with the control vector (pCI-neo), no band was present.Figure 2Construction and expression of bovine CGA and CGB in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. A, schematic diagrams for bovine CGA and CGB used in the transfection analysis. For differential expression, CGA and CGB were tagged with HA (CGA-HA) and His6 (CGB-His) at the C-terminal ends, respectively. The location of highly conserved regions is indicated as gray boxes. Solid boxes at the N-terminal ends of CGA and CGB indicate the leader sequence (L). B, Western analysis of CGA and CGB in the COS-7 cell extracts. The total protein extracts resolved on an 8% SDS-gel were probed serially with the anti-HA and anti-CGA antibodies for CGA (left two panels) and with the anti-His and anti-CGB antibodies for CGB (right two panels). The extract from the pCI-neomycin vector-transfected cells was used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nuclear localization of CGB was also evident when the CGB-GFP fusion protein was expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig.3C). Transfection of the cells with GFP only indicated the expression of GFP throughout the cell with a bit brighter fluorescence in the nuclear area (Fig. 3A). The diffuse fluorescence indicates that GFP is localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and the brighter fluorescence in the nuclear area probably reflects a greater depth of view of the nuclear area when viewed with a fluorescence microscope. But the CGA-GFP expression was limited to punctate localization in the cytoplasm with no localization in the nucleus (Fig. 3B). The punctate localization of CGA-GFP suggests granular localization of CGA-GFP. Though nonneuroendocrine COS-7 cells do not contain secretory granules, it appears apparent that granular structures were found in the CGA-transfected cells, which is consistent with the published results that demonstrated the secretory granule formation in the CGA-transfected nonneuroendocrine cells (27Kim T. Tao-Cheng J.-H. Eiden L.E. Loh Y.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CGB-GFP expression was evident in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig.3C). The cytoplasmic CGB-GFP fluorescence was shown in punctate structures, suggesting the localization of CGB-GFP in granular structures, whereas the nuclear fluorescence did not appear in punctate structures.Figure 3Localization of CGA-GFP and CGB-GFP in COS-7 cells. The C-terminally tagged chromogranin-GFP fusion proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells.

As shown in Fig. 4A, CGB was detected in the nucleus of the CGB-transfected COS-7 cells, and its level was similar to that of the cytosol, but CGA was not detected in the nuclear extract of CGA-transfected COS-7 cells. Similarly, CGB was detected in the nuclear extract of the CGB-transfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4B), but CGA was not detected in the nucleus of CGA-transfected NIH3T3 cells. The purity of the cytosolic and nuclear protein extracts was ensured by examining the existence of the ER marker protein calnexin in the cytosolic proteins and of the nucleus marker protein histone-4 in the nuclear proteins (Fig. 4, Aand B).Figure 4Localization of transfected CGA and CGB in COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells. The presence of CGA and CGB in the protein extracts of total (T), cytosolic (C), and nuclear (N) fractions of COS-7 cells transfected with CGA-GFP and CGB-GFP (A), respectively, and of NIH3T3 cells transfected with CGA-His and CGB-His (B), respectively, was analyzed by immunoblotting using the monoclonal CGA and CGB antibodies. Separation of the cytosolic and nuclear proteins was also ensured by immunoblotting with the polyclonal nuclear marker protein histone-4 and ER marker protein calnexin antibodies. 50 μg of the protein extract per lane was loaded for CGA and CGB immunoblots, but 10 μg of the proteins was loaded for the calnexin and histone-4 immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the nuclear routing of CGB is due to the overexpression of CGB in the CGB-transfected cells, the expression levels of transfected CGA and CGB were determined by measuring the expression levels of the GFP, which had been tagged to both CGA and CGB, in the CGA-GFP- and CGB-GFP-transfected cells (Fig.5A). As shown in Fig.5A, the CGB-GFP expression levels were only one-third or less those of CGA-GFP in NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells. This indicated that the amount of transfected CGB in the chromogranin-transfected NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells is one-third or less that of transfected CGA. Therefore, the nuclear localization of CGB cannot be due to the overexpression of CGB in these cells. Even after taking the larger molecular size of CGB (71 kDa) compared with that of CGA (48 kDa) into consideration, it is obvious that the nuclear routing of CGB is not the result of overexpression of CGB.Figure 5Expression levels of CGA-GFP and CGB-GFP and the separate localization of CGA and CGB in the cells cotransfected with CGA-HA and CGB-His. A, the presence of GFP in the total protein extracts (50 μg/lane) of NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells each transfected with CGA-GFP and CGB-GFP, respectively, was analyzed by immunoblotting using the monoclonal GFP antibody. B, the presence of CGA and CGB in the protein extracts (50 μg/lane) of total (T), cytosolic (C), and nuclear (N) fractions of COS-7 cells cotransfected with CGA-HA and CGB-His (CGA+ CGB) was analyzed using the HA- (CGA-HA) and His- (CGB-His) specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine whether the nuclear routing of CGB can still occur in the nonneuroendocrine cells transfected with both CGA and CGB, CGA-HA and CGB-His were cotransfected into COS-7 cells. The coexpression of CGA and CGB in the same cells was confirmed by labeling the expressed CGA with fluorescein isothiocyanate and CGB with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate, respectively. The immunoblot analysis of the presence of CGA and CGB in the protein extracts of these cells showed the targeting of CGB both to the nucleus and to the cytoplasm and of CGA to the cytoplasm only (Fig. 5B). Identical results were also obtained with the CGA construct tagged with His and the CGB construct tagged with HA. This result indicated that a nuclear routing mechanism that carries CGB, not CGA, to the nucleus is in operation.In view of the fact that PC12 cells contain endogenous CGB (32Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W.H. Zanini A. de Camilli P. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility of detecting endogenous CGB in the nucleus of neuroendocrine PC12 cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig.6). As shown in Fig. 6, endogenous CGB was detected in both the cytosol and the nucleus of these cells although the CGB level in the nucleus was approximately one-third to one-fourth that of cytoplasm. However, unlike CGB, which was detected both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of nontransfected PC12 cells, CGA was detected in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. The immunoblot analysis of the protein extracts from these cells with the antibodies for the nucleus marker protein histone-4 and the endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin ensured the lack of cross-contamination of these protein extracts.Figure 6Presence of endogenous CGB in PC12 cells. The presence of endogenous CGA or CGB in the protein extracts of total (T), cytosolic (C), and nuclear (N) fractions of PC12 cells was analyzed by immunoblotting using the monoclonal CGA and CGB antibodies and the polyclonal nuclear marker protein histone-4 and ER marker protein calnexin antibodies. 50 μg of the protein per lane was loaded for the CGA and CGB immunoblots, but 10 μg of the proteins was loaded for the calnexin and histone-4 immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The immunogold electron microscopy of PC12 cells also indicated the presence of CGB in the nucleus (Fig. 7). Fig. 7A shows the CGB-labeling gold particles in the secretory granules and the nucleus but not in the mitochondria. In the same experiments, omission of the primary antibody or treatment with the preimmune serum in place of the primary antibody eliminated the gold particles almost completely (Fig. 7B), indicating the specific nature of the CGB-labeling immunogold EM results.Figure 7Immunogold electron microscopy showing the localization of CGB in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were immunolabeled for CGB (10 nm gold) with the affinity-purified CGB antibody (A). The CGB-labeling gold particles are localized both in the secretory granules (SG) and in the nucleus (Nu). Some of the CGB-labeling gold particles are shown in the endoplasmic reticulum (rer) but not in the mitochondria (M). Either omission or replacement of the primary antibody with the preimmune serum eliminated virtually all the gold particles in the same PC12 cells (B).

Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar), Pro-Glu-Val-Asp-Lys-Arg-Arg (PEVDKRR) starting at residue 235 (Fig. 8A). This type of NLS starts with Pro and followed by, within three residues, a basic segment containing three of four Lys/Arg residues (reviewed in Ref. 35Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus we tested whether this conserved sequence was responsible for the nuclear localization of CGB by introducing substitution mutations into the putative NLS sequence (Fig. 8A). In this mutant, proline and the critical three basic residues were substituted to serine and hydrophobic residues, resulting in Ser-Glu-Val-Asp-Leu-Gln-Leu (SEVDLQL). The expression of the transfected NLS mutant in COS-7 cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 8B), and the proteins from the whole cells, cytosol, and the nucleus were examined for the presence of CGB (Fig. 8C). Similar to that of wild type CGB, the NLS mutant also expressed CGB both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. However, the relative amount of CGB targeted to the nucleus appeared to be significantly smaller than that shown in the wild type. This result indicated that the putative NLS sequence is not exclusively responsible for the nuclear routing of CGB, thereby suggesting the operation of additional regions of CGB or of f"
https://openalex.org/W2332286545,"To investigate the effect of p33(ING1) on wild-type p53 gene therapy, T.Tn human esophageal carcinoma cells were stably transfected with p33(ING1) cDNA. Infection with Ad-p53 (recombinant adenovirus containing wild-type p53) into p33-transfected cells reduced cell viability, while infection with empty vector had little effect. This reduced viability was shown to be due to apoptotic cell death by the TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling) assay. Following infection with Ad-p53, levels of p53 were similar in p33-expressing cells and in the parental line. However, levels of p21 and Mdm2 were elevated in p33-transfected cells. Nonetheless, this enhanced expression of Mdm2 appeared to be ineffective in downregulating p53. Transient transfection with mutant Mdm2 prior to Ad-p53 infection provided a significant protection as compared with cells transfected with wild-type Mdm2. These results imply a synergistic effect between p33 and p53 in the induction of apoptosis of human esophageal carcinoma cells. A role for Mdm2 in this synergism is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2054518643,"The majority of patients with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease are affected by a VHL germline mutation involving one copy of the VHL gene. Loss of heterozygosity of the second VHL allele can be consistently demonstrated in tumor tissue from these patients, suggesting that allelic deletion is a very early or even initiating event for tumorigenesis. Approximately 20% of VHL disease patients, however, exhibit germline deletion of one entire copy or at least a substantial part of the VHL gene. To investigate the nature of the ""second genetic hit"" in this patient population, we analysed two renal cell carcinomas and one CNS hemangioblastoma from three unrelated patients for genetic changes of the second copy of the VHL gene. All three tumors showed retention of one VHL allele by FISH. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and mutation analysis of microdissected tumor DNA revealed somatic point mutations of the wild-type VHL copies in each of the three tumors. The results indicate that the ""two hit model"" is equally applicable to patients with VHL germline mutation and VHL germline deletion. In contrast to tumors from patients with VHL germline mutation, however, point mutations of the wild-type allele can be detected in tumors from patients with VHL germline deletion."
https://openalex.org/W2161529931,"Several phosphorylations are known to occur in the N-terminal transactivation domain of human p53. To explore the structural effects of these phosphorylations, we have chemically synthesized the unphosphorylated p53-(1–39) and its three phosphorylated analogs, phosphorylated at Ser-15, Thr-18, and Ser-20. p53-(1–39) and its Ser-15 and Thr-18 phosphorylated analogs were tested for interaction with p300. The order of binding affinities was similar to that derived from biochemical experiments with the whole protein, indicating functional integrity of the domain. Differences in chemical shifts and coupling constants indicate significant structural changes upon phosphorylations. The single tryptophan in the unphosphorylated domain has an emission maximum and a Stern-Volmer constant that are characteristics of tryptophans situated in protein interiors. The diffusion constant is monomer-like, with an axial ratio of 1:7.5, indicating a significant degree of compaction. Upon phosphorylations, the emission maximum and diffusion constant change significantly toward values that indicate more open conformations. Binding of the hydrophobic probe bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate to the unphosphorylated and one of the phosphorylated domains is also significantly different, suggesting different conformations. We propose that phosphorylations switch the largely folded transactivation domain to more open conformations that interact with transcription factors such as p300/cAMP- responsive element-binding protein-binding protein, leading to enhancement of gene expression.

Various stress signals integrate by means of post-translational modifications of the p53 protein, resulting in different downstream responses (1Appella E. Anderson C.W. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2000; 48: 227-245PubMed Google Scholar). A major response is to halt cell cycle progression with corresponding activation of genes needed for DNA repair. A second kind of response is apoptosis (2Puri P.L. Maclachlan T.K. Levero M. Giordano A. Stein G.S. Baserga R. Giordano A. Denhardt D.T. The Molecular Basis of Cell Cycle and Growth Control. Wiley-Liss, New York1999: 15-79Google Scholar). Genotoxic stresses activate many cellular kinases that phosphorylate various serine and threonine residues in p53, as well as enzymes that cause lysine acetylations (3Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Presently, at least 12 serine/threonines and 2 lysines are known to be modified in p53 and there may be more modification sites. This signaling system and the code of post-translational modification are still incompletely understood (1Appella E. Anderson C.W. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2000; 48: 227-245PubMed Google Scholar). An understanding of the structural basis of such signal integration and transduction remains a distant dream. p53 is a multidomain protein. The N-terminal domain 1–73 is responsible for transactivation function and binding of such proteins as Mdm2/Hdm2, which down-regulate the levels of p53 (4Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of p53 is emerging as one of the most important regions in p53 function. One of the major pathways of transactivation is through interaction with p300/CBP1and recruitment of this protein to the required promoter region. p300/CBP has well known histone acetyltransferase activity, which results in histone acetylation and remodeling of the chromosome in that region leading to enhanced transcription (5Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Clearly, interactions of the N-terminal domain of p53 with Mdm2 and p300/CBP and possibly with other regulatory proteins are of crucial importance in understanding the various roles played by p53 as the guardian of the genome. Although crystal or NMR structures of other domains have been reported (6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 7Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), very little is known about the structure of this important domain. Only very recently, an NMR study of this domain has shown this to be disordered, although the authors concluded that secondary structural elements are present (8Lee H. Mok K.H. Muhandiram R. Park K.H. Suk J.E. Kim D.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Choi K.Y. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It now appears that there are at least eight phosphorylation sites within the N-terminal subdomain: serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 33, 37, and 46 and threonine 18 (1). Functions of several of these phosphorylations are not clear. However, it appears that the Ser-15 phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the transactivation process (9Stewart Z.A. Tang L.J. Pietenpol J.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Damia G. Filiberti L. Vikhanskaya F. Carrassa L. Taya Y. D'incalci M. Broggini M. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Bean L.J. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-15 occurs very soon after initial stressing of the cells (12She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Among other things, this phosphorylation leads to phosphorylation of the Thr-18 by casein kinase-1 (13Dumaz N. Milne D.M. Meek D.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and consequent inhibition of interaction of p53 with Mdm2 (14Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Ser-15 phosphorylation also leads to greatly increased binding of p53 to CBP/p300. It is also possible that the phosphorylation of Ser-15 leads to an enhancement of acetylation of C-terminal lysines and has some effect on p53 mediated apoptosis (15Unger T. Sionov R.V. Moallem E. Yee C.L. Howley P.M. Oren M. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Such multiple effects of a single phosphorylation suggest that this phosphorylation may be causing a conformational change in the transactivation domain of the protein. Similarly, phosphorylation at Ser-20 has been implicated in various downstream responses (10Damia G. Filiberti L. Vikhanskaya F. Carrassa L. Taya Y. D'incalci M. Broggini M. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Jabbur J.R. Huang P. Zhang W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6203-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Chehab N.H. Malikzay A.

In this study we have focused our attention on the structural consequences of the phosphorylation of Ser-15, Thr-18, and Ser-20 in the N-terminal domain. Because it is difficult to produce specifically phosphorylated derivatives of the whole protein, we have chosen to study the N-terminal subdomain 1–39, which can be chemically synthesized in phosphorylated forms in large quantities. Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Vydac C-8 column was purchased from Grace-Vydac (Hesperia, CA). All other materials were of high quality analytical grade. His6-tagged recombinant full-length p300 was expressed in Sf21 insect cells by using the baculovirus expression system and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification as described previously (18Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus for 72 h, following which they were harvested and homogenized in a homogenization buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole). The cleared lysate was bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen GmbH) and washed in the same buffer with 300 mm NaCl and 15 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted in the homogenization buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. The purified protein showed a single band upon Coomassie stain and Western blot. It was also fully functional by histone acetyltransferase assay. The p53-(1–39) peptide and its phosphorylated derivatives were synthesized by the solid phase method with Fmoc chemistry using a model 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Phosphoserine was incorporated as Fmoc-Ser(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH, and phosphothreonine was incorporated as Fmoc-Thr(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH. Peptides were cleaved from the resin, and side-chain protecting groups were removed by incubating in reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid:phenol:thioanisole:H2O:ethanedithiol, 82.5:5:5:5:2.5) for 3 h at room temperature. The p53-(1–39) peptide and its phosphorylated derivatives were purified by HPLC on a pH-stable Vydac C-8 column with 0.2% hexafluoroacetone-NH4OH, pH 7.0, acetonitrile. The masses of peptides were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Voyager PR-HR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Another truncated version of p53, Pep53-(17–28) and a variant (Bpep53; see below for the sequence) were synthesized in a Biolynx 4175-peptide synthesizer using Fmoc protocol. Amino acids, except those stated below, were used as N-terminal Fmoc-protected and C-terminally pentafluorophenyl ester-activated withN-hydroxybenzotriazole. α-Aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), Asp, and Thr were used in the COOH form using benzotriazole-1-yloxytrispyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate as activating agent with N-hydroxybenzotriazole andN,N-diisopropyl ethylamine (1:1:2). The peptides were acetylated at the N terminus using acetic anhydride and triethylamine (1:1) and cleaved from the resin (Novasyn KA) with trifluoroacetic acid:ethanedithiol:anisole:phenol (94:2:2:2, v/v/v/w). Both the peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC on C-18 (Waters Associates) column using 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and characterized by NMR. The sequences of the two peptides are ETFSDLWKLLPE (Pep53) and BTFBDBWKBLBE (Bpep53), where B stands for Aib. All NMR spectra were taken in a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a Z-field gradient probe. All measurements were done in high precision 5-mm NMR tubes in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl in 90% H2O and 10% D2O. All NMR experiments were done at 27 °C, unless stated otherwise. TOCSY and NOESY spectra were measured using standard pulse sequences in the Bruker pulse library using WATERGATE water suppression method. The diffusion measurements were carried out by stimulated echo-based pulse sequence (90° gradient pulse, 90° delay for diffusion, 90° gradient pulse acquisition). Typical delay for diffusion was set at 200 ms (202.244 (= Δ in the equation below) ms counting finite length of the pulses) (19Canet D. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance: Concepts and Methods. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar). The strength of the gradient (G) pulse was varied, and G2versus ln[intensity] was plotted. The strength of the gradient and the intensity are related by the following equation. lnI=-[{γ⋅G⋅δ}2⋅D⋅{Δ-δ/3}]Equation 1 I is the intensity, γ is the gyromagnetic ratio,D is the diffusion constant, δ is the delay between the first two 90° pulses, Δ is the delay between two gradient pulses (includes delay for diffusion), and G is the strength of the gradient pulse. From the slope of the line, D can be calculated, because all other parameters are known.D20,w values were calculated according to Cantor and Schimmel (20Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. II. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 584Google Scholar). Perrin factors and hydrodynamic radii were calculated from diffusion constants according to Cantor and Schimmel (20Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. II. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 584Google Scholar). The temperature was 27 °C.JNH-αH values were derived from double quantum-filtered COSY spectra according to Kim and Prestegard (21Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Proteins. 1990; 8: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). CD spectra were measured in a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 100 mm NaCl. The cuvette path length was 2 mm. Temperature was 7.5 °C. The bandwidth was 2 nm, and scan speed was 20 nm/min. All fluorescence spectra were measured in a Hitachi F-3010 fluorescence spectrophotometer at ambient temperature (25 ± 1 °C), unless stated otherwise. Acrylamide quenching was done in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 100 mm NaCl. The observed fluorescence values were corrected for volume change and inner filter effect. Inner filter effect was corrected using the formula Fcorr =Fobs × antilog[(Aex +Aem)/2]. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission wavelength was 340 nm. Excitation and emission band passes were 5 nm each. The quenching data was fitted to the Stern-Volmer equation: F0/F = 1 + Ksv[Q], whereF0 is the fluorescence intensity at zero quencher concentration, F is the intensity at a given quencher concentration Q, and Ksv is the Stern-Volmer constant. Bis-ANS binding was carried out in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Excitation and emission band passes were set to 5 nm. 10 μm p53-(1–39) or Ser20P was titrated with increasing concentrations of bis-ANS, and fluorescence intensity at 490 nm was recorded. The excitation wavelength was 387 nm. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for volume changes and inner filter effect. Ser15P was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate at low pH so that the modification may be primarily directed toward the N terminus (resulting from lower pK of the α-amino group (Ref. 22Garel J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). 7.7 μm Ser15P was mixed with 20-fold molar excess of fluorescein isothiocyanate in 5% v/v ethanol (final concentration) in 0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, at 25 °C, with continuous stirring for 4 h. It was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded on to a Sephadex G-25 column, equilibrated, and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 100 mm KCl. For direct titration, 720 nm fluorescein-labeled Ser15P in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 100 mm KCl was titrated with p300, and the anisotropy was determined at each point. The excitation wavelength was 480 nm, and the emission wavelength was 520 nm. For the competition experiments, 360 nm labeled Ser15P was mixed with 360 nm p300 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 100 mm KCl buffer and incubated for 5 min. This buffer was different from the buffer used for other spectroscopic experiments, as p300 is known to be stable in this buffer. The anisotropy was then determined, followed by addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled competing peptide. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 480 and 520 nm, respectively. The excitation and emission band passes were 10 and 5 nm, respectively. Anisotropy (A) was calculated according to the following formula:A = (I|| −I⊥)/(I|| + 2I⊥), where I|| is the fluorescence intensity with parallel polarizers (0/0) and I⊥ is the fluorescence intensity with crossed polarizers (0/90). Because we have attempted to work with the isolated p53-(1–39) fragment, it is important to assess the structural and functional integrity of this isolated domain. The functional integrity of the 1–39 domain can be judged from its interaction with the natural receptors, e.g. TAF, Mdm2, or p300 (23Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that this domain binds to TAF and Mdm2 with high affinity (14Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14801-14806Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, we have measured the binding of the 1–39 domain of p53 and two of its phosphorylated derivatives with p300. We have used fluoresceinated Ser15P peptide to measure binding by fluorescence anisotropy. Fig.1A shows the titration of fluoresceinated Ser15P with increasing concentrations of p300. Anisotropy increased and then quickly saturated. When the data were fitted to a single-site binding equation, a dissociation constant of 81 nm was obtained. A qualitative estimate of binding constants of Thr18P and p53-(1–39) was obtained using competition with these unlabeled fragments. Fig. 1 (B and C) shows the decrease in anisotropy when a complex of p300 and fluoresceinated Ser15P, 360 nm each, was titrated with increasing concentrations of either unlabeled Thr18P or p53-(1–39). In the case of Thr18P, the anisotropy decreased very rapidly and returned to the value of the free Ser15P peptide when the concentration reached 1:1 stoichiometry with p300. This suggests total displacement of the Ser15P peptide from the complex by an equal concentration of Thr18P. This indicates a much higher binding affinity of Thr18P as compared with Ser15P with p300. On the other hand, p53-(1–39) only weakly displaced Ser15P from the p300 complex. Even a 10-fold molar excess was not able to displace it fully (displacement may be only 50%, as can be estimated from anisotropy value), indicating at least severalfold weaker affinity. Two papers have attempted to estimate binding affinities of phosphorylated p53 protein (21Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Proteins. 1990; 8: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). It appears that Ser-15 phosphorylated p53 binds much more tightly than the unphosphorylated one and Thr18P also binds very tightly compared with Ser15P. Thus, the isolated 1–39 domain faithfully reproduces the functional nature of the protein, indicating retention of functional integrity. To find out if there were significant structural differences between p53-(1–39) fragment and the 1–73 domain, chemical shifts of both these fragments were compared (8Lee H. Mok K.H. Muhandiram R. Park K.H. Suk J.E. Kim D.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Choi K.Y. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Almost complete assignment of unmodified p53-(1–39) fragment was made using standard two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY/TOCSY strategy (26Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The chemical shift differences of the amide protons are shown in Fig.2A. The differences are largely confined to the N- and C-terminal ends. The difference at the C-terminal end is readily reconcilable, as the 1–39 fragment contains a free α-carboxyl group whereas the 1–73 fragment consists of continuing peptide chain. The difference in the N terminus is likely to arise from the additional residues and N-terminal modification of the recombinant protein (8Lee H. Mok K.H. Muhandiram R. Park K.H. Suk J.E. Kim D.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Choi K.Y. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Only two residues, 16 and 28, in the middle showed greater than 0.1 ppm difference in chemical shifts. The implications of this observation are not clear, although indirect effects of extra residues in the N terminus cannot be completely ruled out. Thus, clearly the 1–39 fragment is similar to the 1–73 domain in structure and it is unlikely that the 1–39 subdomain has any strong interaction with the rest of the domain. Chemical shifts can also be used to compare structural differences between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated domains. We have compared the chemical shifts of amide resonances of the unphosphorylated and three phosphorylated domains. Fig. 2(B–D) shows the chemical shift differences for amide protons between p53-(1–39) and Ser15P, Thr18P, and Ser20P, respectively. In all three cases, the largest difference was seen for the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residue, as expected. In case of Thr18P, very significant shift was also observed for the proximal residues, Phe19 and Ser-20. Interestingly, relatively large shifts were seen for some residues, which are distant from the phosphorylation site. This distant effect was found in all three phosphorylated domains, but appeared to be more pronounced in Thr18P and Ser20P. Glu-28, Ser-37, Gln-38, and Ala-39 showed changes of chemical shift greater than 0.1 ppm. In the case of Ser20P, modest chemical shift changes were seen throughout residues 21–30. All the residues were fairly distant from the modification site, suggesting long range interactions present in the domain. In particular, the residues at the C-terminal end, Ser-37, Gln-38, and Ala-39, are so distant from the phosphorylation site that secondary structure-mediated change can be ruled out. Another parameter that may reflect conformational change is the coupling constant between NH and CαH (JNH-αH). This coupling constant tends to have a low value (∼4–5 Hz) when the Ramachandran angle (φ) is in the helical range and a high value (∼8–9 Hz) when the Ramachandran angle is in the extended conformation range. Thus, for relatively mobile peptide chains, perhaps lacking a unique conformation, a change in the value of JNH-αH may be a reflection of a change in the distribution among different conformations. Fig.3 shows the difference ofJNH-αH values between p53-(1–39) and Ser15P and Ser20P. It is clear that relatively large changes (∼2 Hz) in the value of JNH-αH occurred. The changes appear to be confined to the central part of the molecule (between residues 16–28) and the C-terminal residues. This pattern is very similar to the changes in the chemical shift, supporting long distance structural changes upon phosphorylation. From a number of studies, it is now well established that tryptophan fluorescence in proteins is a sensitive probe of folding and tertiary structure (27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). A number of fluorescence properties are sensitive to environment and solvent accessibility, two of which are fluorescence emission maximum and Stern-Volmer constant for collisional quenching. To assess the folded nature of the domain, we have measured fluorescence properties of the only tryptophan present at position 23. This is in the central part of the helix that spans the residues 17–26 (6Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and is close to many of the phosphorylation sites in this domain. It is an important determinant for the Mdm2 interaction and possibly the p300/CBP interaction (4Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar, 28Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Thus, environment of this tryptophan residue may shed light on many important aspects of structure and function of this domain. The emission maxima of the unphosphorylated p53-(1–39) and Ser15P, Thr18P, and Ser20P are 341, 343, 350, and 350 nm, respectively (Table I). Fig.4 shows the acrylamide quenching pattern (Stern-Volmer plots) for all the above mentioned domains. It is clear that the plots are linear in most cases and can be fitted well to a Stern-Volmer equation with a single class of fluorophore.Ksv (Stern-Volmer constant) of the domains are 3.9, 8.0, 11.0, and 11.2 m−1 for unphosphorylated, Ser15P, Thr18P, and Ser20P, respectively. As a control we have determined the Ksv values of a peptide consisting of residues 17–28 (Pep53) and the same peptide with five Aib substitutions (Bpep53). Aib substitutions were made to predispose the peptide into a more helical conformation. CD and NMR spectra indicate that Bpep53 is in a helical conformation (data not shown). In both the above mentioned peptides, the Stern-Volmer constants are high, 15.3 and 19.7 m−1 for Pep53 and Bpep53, respectively. The emission maxima are ∼350 nm in both cases. Clearly, the Ksv of the tryptophan undergoes a dramatic reduction in going from Pep53, a largely random coil, to p53-(1–39). Even induction of helix by insertion of Aib does not reduce the Ksv or shift the emission maximum. Thus, the blue-shifted emission maximum in the p53-(1–39) fragment and lowering of Ksv may be the result of long range interactions. The long range interactions result in a folded conformation, which shields Trp-23 from solvent. Change in theKsv value upon phosphorylation suggests a change in environment, and the corresponding red shift of emission maximum suggests that this change leads to an increased exposure of Trp-23. Properties of all the domains are summarized in Table I. Interestingly, for p53-(1–39), the Stern-Volmer plot is somewhat nonlinear, perhaps indicating the presence of multiple conformations. The insetshows the emission maximum shift as a function of increasing acrylamide concentrations for p53-(1–39). The shift of emission maximum for a single tryptophan protein (without tyrosine as well) strongly supports presence of multiple conformations for the p53-(1–39). For the other phosphorylated fragments, no significant emission maximum shift could be detected (data not shown).Table IProperties of transactivation domain of p53 and its different phosphorylated derivativesDomainKSVEmission maximumPerrin factorAxial ratiom−1nmp53-(1–39)3.93411.337.5Ser15P8.03431.4210.0Thr18P11.03501.409.5Ser20P11.23501.4310.0 Open table in a new tab Pulse field gradients NMR can be used to measure translational diffusion constants, which are directly related to the hydrodynamic properties (29Wilkins D.K.

Translational diffusion constants thus can be used to measure hydrodynamic properties of the transactivation domain and its phosphorylated derivatives, which in turn may shed some light on the compactness of the domains and states of aggregation. Fig.5 shows the G2versus ln[intensity] plots for the unphosphorylated and the three phosphorylated domains. All the diffusion constants are summarized in Table II. The translational diffusion constant at 20 °C (D20,w) of the unphosphorylated p53-(1–39) is 1.31 × 10−6 cm2s−1.

https://openalex.org/W1991963540,"Tissue transglutaminase (TGase) is a dual function enzyme that couples an ability to bind GTP with transamidation activity. Retinoic acid (RA) consistently induces TGase expression and activation, and it was recently shown that increased TGase expression protected cells from apoptosis. To better understand how RA regulates TGase, we considered whether RA employed pro-survival signaling pathways to mediate TGase expression and activation. It was found that RA stimulation of NIH3T3 cells activated ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); however, only PI3K activation was necessary for RA-induced TGase expression. The overexpression of a constitutively active form of PI3K did not induce TGase expression, indicating that PI3K signaling was necessary but not sufficient for TGase expression. The exposure of cells expressing exogenous TGase to the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, reduced the ability of TGase to be photoaffinity-labeled with [α-32P]GTP, providing evidence that PI3K regulates the GTP binding activity of TGase as well as its expression. Moreover, cell viability assays showed that incubation of RA-treated cells with LY294002 together with the TGase inhibitor, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), converted RA from a differentiation factor to an apoptotic stimulus. These findings demonstrate that PI3K activity is required for the RA-stimulated expression and GTP binding activity of TGase, thereby linking the up-regulation of TGase with a well established cell survival factor.

The transamidation activity of the TGase catalyzes a reaction in which donor glutamine residues from proteins are covalently linked to acceptor primary amino groups of other proteins or polyamines. The generation of these protein linkages is believed to modulate a variety of cellular processes including the maintenance of extracellular matrix, endocytosis, differentiation, and apoptosis (2.Aeschlimann D.

Many cell types express the TGase protein at low levels, and increases in its expression often occur only after prolonged exposure to certain stimuli (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E.

Retinoic acid-bound RARs function as transcriptional activators that bind to RA response elements found in the promoters of various genes (13.Pfahl M. Apfel R. Bendik I. Fanjul A. Graupner G.

Deletion analysis of the promoter of the TGase gene identified two RA response element motifs, which were required for RA-induced TGase transcription (15.Nagy L. Saydak M. Shipley N. Lu S. Basilion J.P. Yan Z.-H. Syka P. Chandraratna R.A.S. Stein J.P. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4355-4365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Other transcriptional regulators are thought to influence TGase expression (16.Lu S. Saydak M. Gentile V. Stein J.P. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9748-9756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but the identity of these factors and their importance for RA-mediated TGase expression are unclear. Once TGase is expressed, its enzymatic activity can be regulated by binding cofactors such as GTP and calcium (Ca2+). Studies have demonstrated that GTP-bound TGase was limited in its ability to catalyze transamidation, whereas GTP hydrolysis and the binding of Ca2+ enhanced transamidation activity (17.Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, others have reported that both GTP and GDP inhibit the transamidation activity of the TGase (19.Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Koropchak C.M. Haroon Z.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31191-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that GTP binding is not a specific regulator of transamidation but rather may primarily serve to transduce signals. For example, the α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C activity was shown to be mediated by an 80-kDa GTP-binding protein, which was later identified as TGase (20.Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A.M. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Here we used RA-induced TGase expression and activation as a model system to better understand how TGase is regulated in cells. Because we recently reported that TGase activity was implicated in cell survival (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we considered whether RA utilizes pro-survival pathways to mediate TGase expression or activation. We found that both phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were activated by RA, but only PI3K activity was necessary for RA to induce TGase expression. The inhibition of PI3K or TGase activity converted RA from a differentiation factor into an apoptotic signal, suggesting that the survival effect of PI3K may at least in part be attributed to its ability to up-regulate TGase. We further determined that GTP-binding to the TGase was dependent on PI3K. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first demonstration that the induction of TGase expression and GTP binding activity by RA requires the pro-survival factor, PI3K. PD98095 and LY294002 were purchased fromCalbiochem, and EGF and LipofectAMINE PLUS transfection reagent were obtained from Invitrogen. RA, all-trans-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR), and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) were obtained from Sigma. The anti-TGase antibody was from Neomarkers, the anti-HA antibody was from Covance, and the anti-phospho-ERK, anti-ERK, anti-active AKT, and anti-AKT antibodies were all obtained from New England Biolabs. [α-32P]GTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all other materials were from Fisher unless otherwise stated. HL60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum with 100 units/ml penicillin. Both cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the various treatments described, the cells were grown to subconfluence in medium containing 10% serum, and then medium containing 1% serum with 5 μm RA or HPR or 100 ng/ml EGF, ±6 μm LY294002, or 10 μm PD98095 was added for the times indicated under “Results and Discussion.” Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.004% NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphoric acid, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.35). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Total cell lysate of each sample was combined with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE for the resolution of each protein analyzed. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.02% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The filters were incubated with the various primary antibodies diluted in TBST for 2 h at room temperature and then washed three times with TBST. To detect the primary antibodies, anti-mouse or rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in TBST was incubated with the filters for 1 h, followed by three washes with TBST. The protein bands were visualized on x-ray film after exposing the filters to chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Photoaffinity labeling of the TGase was performed by incubating whole cell lysates with 3 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 500 μm AMP-PNP for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were placed in an ice bath and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 15 min, mixed with 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was performed followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters and exposure on x-ray film. Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well dishes and grown in complete medium for 2 days. The cells were then incubated in serum-free medium containing 5 μm RA or HPR, ±75 μm (MDC), or 6 μm LY294002 for 1 day. The cultures were then fixed and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml) for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensed nuclei and/or blebbing. Several studies have demonstrated that the expression and activation of the TGase are tightly coupled to the effects of RA (8.Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V.W. Neuroscience. 2000; 102: 481-491Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9.Chiocca E.A. Davies P.J.A. Stein J.P. J. Biol.

However, it is unclear whether the increases in TGase protein levels and GTP binding activity induced by RA occur solely through up-regulation of the transcriptional activities of the RARs or whether the activation of additional signaling components is needed. Because we recently implicated TGase as a survival factor (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether the anti-apoptotic molecules PI3K and ERK influence TGase expression and/or activation. Fig. 1 A shows that when NIH3T3 cells were incubated with RA there was a progressive increase in TGase protein expression as determined by Western blot analysis and GTP binding activity. GTP binding activity was measured by the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into an ∼80-kDa protein, which we have verified to be TGase based on both protein purification (18.Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitation with an anti-TGase antibody (Fig. 1 B, for review see Ref. 21.Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier findings that showed that long term treatments were required for the up-regulation of TGase activity (1.Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 2000; 102: 481-491Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), nearly 24 h of RA stimulation were needed before increases in TGase expression and activation were evident (Fig. 1 A). We then measured the ability of RA to activate ERK using an antibody that recognizes only the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2. Within 5 min of exposure to the retinoid, ERK activity could be detected at a level comparable with that observed with the positive control, EGF. The RA-induced ERK activation was sustained up to 1 h and then reduced to near basal activity for the duration of the experiment. From the same cell lysates used to analyze ERK induction, PI3K activity was also examined using AKT phosphorylation or activation as a readout. The phosphorylation of AKT provides a reliable assay for PI3K activation, because it has been well established that several pro-survival signals up-regulate AKT phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent manner (22.Bergering B.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 23.Franke F.T. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Utilizing an AKT phospho-specific antibody, we found that AKT phosphorylation was augmented by RA in a time-dependent fashion. AKT induction coincided with RA-mediated ERK activation, having maximal activation at 5 min and decreasing gradually to near background levels by 8 h of stimulation. Others have also demonstrated that ERK and PI3K activities were enhanced by RA in the human leukemia cell line HL60 (24.Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Mischiati C. Capitani S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 542-546PubMed Google Scholar) and that inhibiting the activity of either kinase blocked RA-mediated differentiation. These findings indicate that retinoid-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K activation are not unique to NIH3T3 cells and suggest that their signaling capabilities are involved in some aspects of RA-mediated cellular effects. The differences in the phosphorylation states of ERK and AKT detected with the phospho-specific antibodies throughout the duration of the RA time course were likely a result of posttranslational modifications (i.e. the activation of kinases and phosphatases) rather than changes in protein expression as the ERK and AKT protein levels remained constant in each sample. It is interesting that not only does RA up-regulate similar signaling pathways as growth factors, the rates of activation of ERK and AKT induced by RA closely parallel the transient activations of ERK and AKT following EGF stimulation (26.Antonyak M.A. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27.Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18605-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The fact that both ERK and PI3K activities appear to be enhanced by RA, which is coupled with the finding that RA induces TGase expression, raises the possibility that the activation of these kinases may play a role in up-regulating the expression of the TGase. To address this question, we took advantage of chemical inhibitors that specifically block the activations of either MEK, the immediate activator of ERK, or PI3K. NIH3T3 cells were stimulated with RA for 3 days with or without the addition of the MEK inhibitor, PD98095, or the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, at concentrations known to inhibit the activity of each kinase (26.Antonyak M.A. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and the resulting expression and GTP binding activity of the TGase were determined. As shown in Fig. 2, left, incubating the cells with PD98095 appeared to have no effect on the ability of RA to induce TGase expression or GTP binding activity. Thus, the ERK pathway may be used by this retinoid to mediate the expression of some RA-responsive genes that are distinct from those that influence the expression or GTP binding activity of the TGase. In contrast, the exposure of RA-treated cells to LY294002 severely diminished the protein expression level and corresponding GTP binding activity of the TGase. In several experiments, the LY294002-mediated inhibition of TGase expression and activity ranged from 60 to 90% (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The overexpression of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K in cells also inhibited the RA-induced TGase expression and GTP binding activity similar to LY294002 (Fig. 3), further implicating PI3K signaling in the transcriptional regulation of the TGase. Reprobing the same blots from Fig. 2 with an antibody against actin showed equivalent amounts of this protein in each lane, indicating that the decrease in TGase expression by LY294002 was not a result of a general down-regulation in protein expression (Fig. 2,left). Similar experiments conducted on the human leukemia cell line, HL60, and several other cell types consistently found that RA-induced TGase expression was inhibited when the cells were co-incubated with the PI3K chemical inhibitor (Fig. 2, rightand data not shown).Figure 3Constitutive PI3K activity is not sufficient to induce chronic TGase expression or activation. Cells were transiently transfected with vector only, a HA-tagged myristoylated form of the catalytic subunit of PI3K (HA-p110M), or a HA-tagged form of the regulatory subunit of PI3K (HA-p85) and grown in complete growth medium for 1 day. The medium was replaced with low serum medium ± 5 μm RA, and the cultures were maintained for another 2 days and then lysed. SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane were performed on the whole cell extracts. The expression of the PI3K constructs was detected by probing the blot with a HA antibody, and the expression of TGase was detected using a TGase antibody. The whole cell extracts were also used in affinity labeling assays as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because PI3K activation appears to be necessary for RA to up-regulate TGase expression, we next assessed whether continuous PI3K signaling would be sufficient to cause chronic TGase expression and/or activation in mouse fibroblasts. Despite the expression of a constitutively active form of PI3K (a myristoylated form of the p110 catalytic subunit) in fibroblasts, a corresponding increase in TGase expression was not evident (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the RA treatment of cells overexpressing myristoylated p110 up-regulated TGase expression and GTP binding activity to the same extent as control cells, indicating that continuous PI3K activation was not sufficient to sensitize the induction of TGase expression or activation by RA. Similar experiments conducted in NIH3T3 cells stably overexpressing dominant-active forms of the small G-proteins Ras, Rac, or Cdc42 also did not augment the basal level of RA-induced TGase expression or GTP binding (data not shown). We were also interested in determining whether factors that can activate PI3K other than RA might be capable of regulating TGase expression levels. Sustained stimulation of NIH3T3 cells with EGF for 2 days activated PI3K strongly as indicated by AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 1) but failed to produce a detectable increase in TGase protein levels (Fig. 3). These data strongly suggest that although PI3K activity is essential for RA to induce TGase expression, RA must also influence the function of an additional factor(s) in order to increase TGase expression. We expect that at least one of these factors is likely to be under the transcriptional control of a member of the RAR family based on two lines of evidence. First, the activation of this factor seems to be a specific outcome of RA signaling, because both RA and EGF stimulated PI3K activity but only RA was capable of augmenting TGase expression. Several studies have demonstrated that the RARs preferentially bind to and become activated by retinoids (13.Pfahl M. Apfel R. Bendik I. Fanjul A. Graupner G. Lee M.-O. La-Vista N. Lu X.-P. Piedrafita J. Ortiz A. Salbert G. Zhang X.-K. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 327-392Google Scholar, 14.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman O.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar). Second, it has been well established that the induction of the transcriptional activities of the RARs by binding RA is essential for retinoid-mediated TGase expression (15.Nagy L. Saydak M. Shipley N. Lu S. Basilion J.P. Yan Z.-H. Syka P. Chandraratna R.A.S. Stein J.P. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4355-4365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Increases in TGase expression following exposure to RA are invariably coupled with the induction of the GTP binding activity of the TGase (Fig. 1) (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11.Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3034-3040PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that stimulate the formation of the GTP-bound state of the newly translated TGase protein are currently unknown. Expanding upon our finding that RA requires active PI3K to induce TGase expression, we asked whether PI3K might also affect TGase GTP binding activity independent of the effects on TGase expression. To examine this possibility, we took advantage of previous work that showed that expression of exogenous TGase in cells yielded a TGase species, which was able to bind GTP even without the addition of the stimulatory factor RA (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, NIH3T3 cells transiently expressing a TGase construct incorporated [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 4 A, inset) in a manner similar to the TGase GTP binding activity observed when cells were treated with RA for several days. When duplicate plates of cells expressing exogenous TGase were exposed to LY294002 for 2 days, the ability of the TGase to incorporate [α-32P]GTP was significantly reduced (Fig. 4 A, inset and graph); the average inhibition in several experiments was ∼60%. However, even in the presence of excess concentrations of LY294002, the GTP binding activity of the TGase was not completely eliminated (data not shown), suggesting that a PI3K-independent pathway can contribute to the activation of TGase GTP binding activity. To ensure that the reduction in the GTP binding activity of the exogenous TGase by the chemical inhibitor was a result of down-regulating PI3K activity rather than the result of a nonspecific inhibitory effect on the TGase molecule, we tested whether the GTP binding activity of recombinant purified TGase was altered in the presence of LY294002. Fig. 4 B showed that incubating 25–50 ng of recombinant TGase with increasing concentrations of LY294002 (up to 400 μm) did not change the ability of the TGase to bind GTP as readout by photoaffinity-labeling with [α-32P]GTP. How the signaling capability of PI3K promotes the binding of GTP to the TGase in cells is not understood and is a current focus of our research. One intriguing possibility is that PI3K mediates the expression and/or activation of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for TGase. Once up-regulated, the exchange factor could promote the binding of GTP to the TGase in a manner analogous to the function of guanine nucleotide exchange factors on members of the Ras family of small G-proteins (28.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Another possibility may involve the ability of PI3K signaling to limit the effectiveness of a negative regulator(s) of TGase activity that is known to exist in cells (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The RA-induced stimulation of PI3K activity could produce a signaling event that would somehow disrupt the interaction of the TGase with the inhibitory complex, making the TGase accessible for binding GTP. Having established a link between PI3K and TGase activation, we then examined whether cell fate responses induced by RA would be affected if PI3K activity was inhibited. Under the stress of serum starvation, NIH3T3 cells exposed to RA for nearly 2 days displayed a low rate of apoptosis, whereas the treatment with the related retinoid, HPR, induced a potent cell death response (Fig. 5). Because RA but not HPR was shown to enhance TGase expression and activation, it was proposed that this distinct signaling feature may be important for the anti-apoptotic effects of RA (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, RA-stimulated cells pretreated with MDC, a competitive inhibitor of TGase-catalyzed transanimation, displayed an ∼35% decrease in cell viability (Fig. 5), indicating that the exposure of cells to RA could be sensitized to apoptosis by simply limiting the function of the TGase. Because PI3K activity is required for the RA-induced up-regulation of TGase activity and TGase activity appears to be critical for the survival effect of RA, we examined whether the treatment of RA-stimulated cells with LY294002 gave rise to an increase in cell death. This in fact was the case as the addition of RA to cells treated with LY294002 resulted in a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells. Still, the extent of apoptosis was always less than that of the accompanying HPR treatment, most probably because typically some amount of PI3K activity and corresponding TGase expression and activation persists even in the presence of the inhibitor. However, TGase expression and activation can be completely eliminated when combining LY294002 with MDC, thus yielding a level of apoptosis that was nearly equivalent to that induced by HPR. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that PI3K-mediated TGase activation is a key element of the survival response afforded by RA. TGase activation has largely been associated with programmed cell death (5.Piacentini M. Fesus L. Farrace M.G. Ghibelli L. Piredda L. Melino G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Oliverio S. Amendola A. DiSano F. Farrace M.G. Fesus L. Nemes Z. Piredda L. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34123-34128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, more recently, TGase function has been shown either not to be directly linked to the apoptotic process (8.Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V.W. Neuroscience. 2000; 102: 481-491Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30.Nanda N. Iismaa S.E. Owens W.A. Husain A. Mackay F. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20673-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) or to have an anti-apoptotic role in cells (7.Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The fact that we have now demonstrated that RA-mediated TGase expression and activation require the activation of the well established survival factor PI3K further implicates TGase in a survival role. At present, we do not know how PI3K signaling influences the expression of the TGase, although presumably it will involve the activation of one or more known PI3K effectors such as ribosomal S6 kinase or AKT. AKT is an especially interesting possibility, because it has been implicated in promoting the expression of survival genes by activating the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and the nuclear κB transcription factors (31.Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Thus, in summary, we have shown for the first time that RA activates the signaling molecule, PI3K, and that this activation is essential for the ability of RA to induce the expression and subsequent activation of the TGase. How both PI3K and ERK become activated following RA stimulation is unclear and warrants further investigation. The RARs are nuclear receptors that upon binding RA become active transcription factors, which modulate the expression of RA-responsive genes (13.Pfahl M. Apfel R. Bendik I. Fanjul A. Graupner G.

Although it is generally believed that RA-induced cellular responses occur via the up-regulation of gene expression, our data imply that RA is capable of directly activating similar intracellular signaling cascades as those activated by growth factors. In support of this idea, RA treatment has previously been reported to increase the activation of several intracellular signaling proteins including focal adhesion kinase (32.Zhu W.-Y. Jones C.S. Amin S. Matsukuma K. Haque M. Vuligonda V. Chandraratna R.A.S. DeLuca L.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 85-90PubMed Google Scholar), ERK (24.Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T.

We are beginning to evaluate whether RA can activate additional signaling cascades that contribute to the up-regulation of TGase expression and/or its activation.

Sections were incubated in rabbit anti-orexin polyclonal antibody (8.Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S.

Orexin immunoreactivity was visualized with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase system (Vector Labs, Inc.) using 0.01m imidazole acetate buffer containing 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.005% hydrogen peroxide. We examinedlacZ reporter gene expression in the hypothalamuses of transgenic founder mice (F0 or G0 for generation 0) from 4 to 9 weeks of age throughout this study. The percentage of the β-galactosidase-positive (β-gal+) population within the orexin-ir+ neurons in the LHA was determined by counting β-gal+ neurons and orexin-ir+ neurons in 10 serial coronal sections containing ∼2 × 103 orexin neurons. The percentage of β-gal+ neurons distributed in the medial regions of the hypothalamus was calculated relative to the number of the total β-gal+ neurons in the whole hypothalamus in the same coronal sections. The percentage was used as a parameter for ectopic medial expression of the reporter gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as described previously (20.Wadman I.A. Osada H.

Nuclear extract was prepared from mouse hypothalamus following a standard procedure (22.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Hypothalamic nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in a volume of 25 μl containing 100 pg of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dA-dT), 75 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 4% Ficoll. DNA-protein complexes were separated by 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. Because we wished to study the basic mechanisms of prepro-orexin gene transcriptional regulation, we searched for regions conserved during molecular evolution in orexin genes. To this end, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5.1-kbKpnI fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the mouse prepro-orexin gene. Sequence comparisons were then made of the 5′-flanking regions of the transcription initiation sites of the mouse (this study) and human (14.Sakurai T. Moriguchi T. Furuya K. Kajiwara N. Nakamura T.

Two highly conserved regions were identified and called OE1 and OE2 (Fig. 1, A and B). OE1 encompasses a 214-bp PvuII-PstI region located 287 bp 5′ of the transcription initiation site of the human prepro-orexin gene. OE2 is a 217-bp region and lies 2.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the human gene. No conserved regions were found in either the introns or the 3′-flanking regions of the human and mouse prepro-orexin genes. In the human gene, five copies of the highly repetitive elements of the primate Alu family are located in the middle of the 3.2-kb upstream region (14.Sakurai T. Moriguchi T. Furuya K. Kajiwara N. Nakamura T. Yanagisawa M. Goto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17771-17776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although some mouse B1 repeats, which are counterparts of the human Alurepeats, were observed in the mouse 5′-flanking region, these repetitive sequences were not involved in the phylogenetically conserved regions (23.Strachan T. Read P.A. Human Molecular Genetics. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford, UK1996: 198-201Google Scholar). The 3.2-kb upstream promoter region of the human prepro-orexin gene contains OE1, OE2, and five copies of anAlu repeat sequence. To delineate which regulatory modules direct LHA-specific orexin gene expression, we examined a series of constructs containing deleted regions of the 3.2-kb sequence fused to alacZ reporter gene (Fig. 2). Consistent with the previous analysis (14.Sakurai T. Moriguchi T. Furuya K. Kajiwara N. Nakamura T. Yanagisawa M. Goto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17771-17776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the complete 3.2-kb regulatory region (3.2nlacZ) drove lacZ gene expression specifically in orexin-ir+ neurons in the LHA (Fig. 3 A). Indeed, five of eight 3.2nlacZ transgenic founder mice showed β-gal+ staining (Fig. 2) that overlapped with anti-orexin immunostaining (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Transgenic mouse reporter gene expression analysis of the human prepro-orexin gene.

Surprisingly, no β-gal+ staining was observed in orexin-ir+neurons residing in the LHA of delt-OE1nlacZ transgenic mice. In contrast, three of eight delt-OE1nlacZ transgenic founder mice showed β-gal+ staining in the medial regions of the hypothalamus, including the dorsomedial hypothalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the ARC (Figs. 2 and 3, C andD). These results indicate that a shift in lacZreporter gene expression from the lateral to the medial regions of the hypothalamus occurs when OE1 is deleted from the 3.2-kb regulatory region. The minimal construct 0.4nlacZ, containing OE1 and the endogenous promoter region, failed to direct lacZ expression in orexin neurons (Fig. 2). In fact, the only lacZ gene expression observed with this transgenic construct was ectopically in the posterior hypothalamus of one (of five) transgenic mouse. Addition of a 0.9-kb upstream region (1.3nlacZ) recovered thelacZ reporter gene expression in orexin neurons in the LHA of all seven transgenic founder mice examined (Figs. 2 and 3,E and F). However, 1.3nlacZ also drove the lacZ gene expression in the ARC. A similar expression profile was observed in the 2.1nlacZ transgenic founder mice, albeit with lower frequency, indicating that the required regulatory regions for transgene expression in both the LHA and ARC are located in the 0.9-kb region. It is intriguing that most of the 0.9-kb region is composed of human Alu repeats (see Fig. 2 and below). These observations led us to quantify the β-gal+population within the lateral hypothalamic orexin-ir+neurons (β-gal+/orexin-ir+ neurons) and the medial regions of the hypothalamus (Table I). In 3.2nlacZ transgenic mice, the β-gal reporter was expressed in 34.3% (n = 5) of the orexin-ir+ neurons (Table I). However, the number of these β-gal+/orexin-ir+ neurons declined to 11.2% in 1.3nlacZ transgenic mice (n = 7). Furthermore, ectopic lacZ gene expression in non-orexin neurons within the ARC was seen in all seven 1.3nlacZtransgenic founder mice. Calculation of the number of β-gal+ neurons in the medial regions of the hypothalamus as a percentage of the total β-gal+ cells in the whole hypothalamus showed that all β-gal+ neurons occurred in the medial regions of the hypothalamuses of delt-OE1nlacZtransgenic mice (Table I). This is in stark contrast to the insignificant lacZ reporter gene expression found in the medial regions of the hypothalamuses of transgenic mice expressing the intact 3.2nlacZ gene. In 1.3nlacZ and 2.1nlacZ mice, 22.6% (n = 7) and 56.3% (n = 2), respectively, of the total β-gal+ neurons were found in the medial regions of the hypothalamus (Table I), indicating that the 2.1-kb region is not sufficient to define the specific LHA expression profile associated with normal prepro-orexin gene expression.Table ITransgenic mouse reporter gene expression analysis of a series of deletion constructs of the 3.2-kb upstream promoter region of the human prepro-orexin geneConstructTransgenic mouse nameβ-gal+/orexin-ir+β-gal+in medial HT/total β-gal+ in HT(%)(%)3.2nlacZA328.60D534.34.0J242.3022436.5022532.30delt-OE1nlacZ1190100120010012101001.3nlacZ89710.550.060017.225.24615.014.745812.427.845915.517.046210.28.64607.512.52.1nlacZ47619.748.566718.664.0delt-AlunlacZ10023.009632.30Transgenic founder mice were used in this analysis. The percentage of the β-gal+ population within the orexin-ir+neurons in the LHA was determined by counting β-gal+neurons and orexin-ir+ neurons in 10 serial coronal sections containing ∼2 × 103 orexin neurons.

The percentage of β-gal+ neurons distributed in the medial regions of the hypothalamus (HT) was calculated relative to the number of total β-gal+ neurons in the whole hypothalamus in the same coronal sections. We then examined the function of OE2 to direct the LHA-specific expression of the prepro-orexin gene with the reporter transgenic assay. To our surprise, attachment of the OE2 region to the basic 0.4nlacZ construct restored the lacZexpression specificity in the orexin neurons in the LHA of two of nine delt-AlunlacZ transgenic founder mice (Fig. 2). The expression driven by the construct lacking Alu repeats was highly specific to the orexin-ir+ neurons (Fig. 3,G and H). Importantly, the population of β-gal+/orexin-ir+ neurons was comparable to that of the 3.2nlacZ transgenic mice, with undetectable β-gal staining in the medial regions of the hypothalamus (Table I). These results indicate that, in addition to OE1, OE2 is indispensable for the cell lineage-specific expression of the prepro-orexin genein vivo. Because our analyses so far utilized the transgenic F0 mice exclusively, concerns developed as to whether transgene expression is stably transmitted to the next generation and whether there is a proportional level of transgene expression among progeny animals from a single line. To address these issues, some of the transgenic F0 mice generated in this study were mated to obtain their progeny mice. As a result, 15 founder mice resulted in progeny. Of the 15 lines of progeny mice, transgene expression was observed in nine lines: 3.2nlacZ (lines A3 and D5), 1.3nlacZ (lines 459 and 460), 2.1nlacZ (lines 476 and 667), delt-AlunlacZ (line 1000), 3.2delt-1nlacZ (line 124), and 3.2delt-2nlacZ(line 20); and the expression level in the F1 mice was comparable to that in the F0 mice, indicating that the regulatory activity within the transgenes was transmitted stably through generations. Indeed, some of the lines were mated further up to F9, but β-gal+ neurons did not decrease with the generation number in these lines (data not shown). We then compared lacZ reporter gene expression in the orexin neurons of five progeny animals per transgenic line. No significant variation of lacZ expression was observed in the five progeny animals from each line (Table II), suggesting that once established as a line, transgene expression is stably maintained. In contrast, β-gal+ neurons were not found in the other six lines of a transgene-positive mouse. Methylation of the transgene or segregation of transgenes integrated into multiple genetic loci may explain the latter case (24.Lau S. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Table IIVariation of transgene expression in progeny animals within one lineConstructTransgenic mouse nameβ-gal+/orexin-ir+(%)3.2nlacZA336.5 ± 6.5D527.2 ± 4.52.1nlacZ47616.7 ± 5.466718.6 ± 7.21.3nlacZ45912.7 ± 4.346011.6 ± 3.4delt-AlunlacZ100027.8 ± 4.23.2delt-1nlacZ1248.4 ± 5.53.2delt-2nlacZ*200 ± 0Fifteen transgenic F0 mice resulted in transgene-positive progeny.

The A3B3CDF complex of the Methanosarcina mazei Gö1 A1-ATPase, which is investigated here, consists of an ∼96-Å long headpiece and an 84-Å high and 60-Å diameter stalk as shown by small-angle x-ray scattering (14.Grüber G.

In particular, the F1-ATPase has a significantly shorter stalk than A1, ∼40–45 Å long and 50–53 Å wide (12.Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct.

The prevailing view is, however, that ATP hydrolysis in the A1 headpiece is coupled to ion flow in AOthrough movements of the central stalk subunit(s) (2.Schäfer G. Engelhard M. Müller V. Mol.

Although the energy-transducing mechanism of A-ATPase is thought to be similar to that of the F-ATPase, evidence for structural alterations during coupling in the A-ATPase has been lacking. Here we describe this phenomenon in the A1-ATPase by a variety of biophysical and biochemical methods. Altered overall dimensions of the A1complex, fluorescence changes, trypsin susceptibility, and CuCl2-induced cross-link formation between various subunits of A1 are discussed in the light of different ligand-dependent states.

The cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of 10 mmEDTA, subsequently dissolved in DTT-free dissociation buffer, and applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described above. The subunits involved in cross-linking were identified by Western blotting (22.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using antisera against subunit A and B as described previously (17.Lemker T. Ruppert C. Stöger H. Wimmers S. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and mass spectrometric analysis. For the latter the cross-linked bands were cut out from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel and destained with a solution of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile for 12 h. The gel band was cut into pieces of 1 mm3, which were washed three times with acetonitrile, dried for 30 min in a speed-vacuum concentrator, and digested according to a procedure modified from Hellmann et al. (23.Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and Roos et al. (24.Roos M. Soskic V. Poznanovic S.

For MALDI mass spectrometry, aliquots of 0.5 μl of the digested solution were applied to a target disc and allowed to dry in the air. Subsequently, 0.5 μl of matrix solution (1% w/v α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and also allowed to dry. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The protein fragments were identified using programs from the University of California, San Francisco (rafael.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/msfit), the ProFound program of Rockefeller University (prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound), the PepSearch program of the EMBL in Heidelberg (www.mann.embl-heidelberg.de/Services/PeptideSearch/FR_peptideSearchForm.html), and TagIdent available on the ExPASy WWW server. Before labeling withN-[4-[7-(dimethylamino)-4-methyl]coumarin-3-yl)]maleimide (CM), A1 was depleted of nucleotides as described above. The enzyme was labeled with 50 μm CM for 10 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.9) and 150 mm NaCl (buffer A). Excess label was removed by one pass through a Sephadex G-25 spin column, equilibrated in buffer A. Fluorescence emission spectra of CM-bound A1 in the presence and absence of 5 mmof different nucleotides were recorded at 10 °C using an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorimeter. Protein samples were excited at 365 nm, and the emission was recorded from 410 to 560 nm with excitation and emission bandpasses set to 4 nm. In order to determine the amount of hydrolyzed MgATP after the fluorescent measurement, a 200-μl portion of the sample was denatured with 20 μl of 14% perchloric acid and cooled on ice for 15 min. The denatured protein was then pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 2 min (25.Bullough D.A. Brown E.L. Saario J.D. Allison W.S. J. Biol.

The supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing 3 μl of 5m K2CO3 for neutralization. The nucleotide content of 100-μl samples of this supernatant was determined by FPLC (Econo-System, Bio-Rad) using a DEAE-MEMSEP (10/10) column eluted by a linear gradient of 0–1 m triethylamine, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 5 ml/min at room temperature. The eluents were monitored by absorption at 254 nm, and the amounts were determined by integration of absorption peaks, calibrated with ATP and ADP standards. A1-ATPase was incubated at a concentration of 8 μg with trypsin in a ratio of 900:1 (w/w) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mmNaCl in the absence or presence of 5 mm nucleotide at 30 °C. Trypsin cleavage was stopped by addition of the protease inhibitor Pefabloc SC (8 mm). Peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE (14.Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H.

At sample detector distances of 3.9 m and 1.4 m and a wavelength λ = 0.15 nm, the ranges of momentum transfer 0.14 < s < 2.1 nm−1 were covered (s = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle).

The molecular masses of the solutes were estimated by comparison with the forward scattering of a reference solution of bovine serum albumin. Previously, we have characterized the A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1 by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and determined the maximum dimension (18.0 ± 0.1 nm) and the radius of gyration (R g, 5.03 ± 0.1 nm (14.Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Here SAXS was used to investigate possible changes of the quaternary structure of A1 due to substrate binding. Fig. 1 displays a native gel and the scattering profile of A1, free of loosely bound nucleotides and an ATPase activity of ∼8.0 μmol of ATP hydrolysis per mg of enzyme per min. The radius of gyration (5.02 ± 0.1 nm) is in agreement with previous results (14.Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, when 5 mmMgADP, MgADP + Pi, or MgATP was added to the protein solution, the radii of gyration of the complexes increased to 5.14 ± 0.1, 5.21 ± 0.1, and 5.23 ± 0.1 nm, respectively (see Table I). In the presence of the unhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, the enzyme had a slightly lowerR g = 4.92 ± 0.1 nm. The maximum dimension of the unligated or ligated A1-ATPase remained the same (18.0 ± 0.1 nm).Table IExperimentally determined radii of gyration, R g, of the A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1 dependent on nucleotide conditionsAdded nucleotidesR g(nm)None5.02 ± 0.15 mm MgATP5.23 ± 0.15 mmMgADP5.14 ± 0.15 mm MgADP + Pi5.21 ± 0.15 mm MgAMP PNP4.92 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab To characterize further the structural changes described above, the nucleotide-binding subunits A and B were specifically labeled using the fluorescent label CM, as visualized on the polyacrylamide gel in Fig. 2 A. The higher intensity of CM bound at subunit A may be due to the fact that subunit A includes five Cys residues (Cys28, Cys65, Cys173, Cys255, and Cys372 (33.Wilms R. Freiberg C. Wegerle E. Meier I. Mayer F. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18843-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) and thereby more possible sulfhydryl groups reacting with the maleimide. The activity of the CM-bound enzyme was not altered by the chemical modification. Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence spectrum of the CM labeled A1-ATPase, which was freed of bound nucleotides (Fig. 3, curve ▴) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For comparison, addition of 5 mm MgATP to the protein (in a 1:1 ratio) causes the signal to increase and to shift to shorter wavelength (Fig. 3,curve ▵). Addition of MgADP (Fig. 3, curve ■) gave a spectrum similar to that obtained with MgATP but with a lower fluorescence maximum. In contrast, A1-ATPase in the presence of MgADP + Pi (Fig. 3, curve ○) displayed a lower fluorescence intensity and a small blue shift. Interestingly, addition of the non-cleavable nucleotide analogue AMP-PNP (Fig. 3, curve ⋄) caused an increase of the fluorescence signal, indicating that the MgATP-bound enzyme is catalyzing ATP hydrolysis during the measurements. This is also confirmed by the fact that 85% of the added MgATP is still present after the fluorescence measurement, as determined by FPLC. The results presented indicate that the fluorescence spectrum of CM bound to subunits A and B is sensitive to nucleotide binding.Figure 3Nucleotide-induced fluorescence changes of the CM-bound A1-ATPase. The fluorescence emission spectra of the A1-ATPase was measured with a protein concentration of 200 nm and a 1:1 ratio of Mg2+to nucleotide at 10 °C. The enzyme was diluted in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.9) and 150 mm NaCl and preincubated with 5 mm MgAMP-PNP (curve ⋄), MgATP (curve ▵), MgADP (curve ■), and MgADP + Pi (curve ○) on ice.

A. 2001; 98: 8519-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond formation was mediated by Cu2+. Fig. 4 A illustrates the results of cross-linking of the A1-ATPase with CuCl2 under different nucleotide conditions. When the enzyme was incubated with 5 mm MgAMP-PNP at 4 °C before Cu2+ treatment, two new bands (I and V) involving subunit(s) B (I) and A-B (V) were generated, as indicated by Western blotting with antibodies to subunits A and B (Fig. 4 B). MALDI mass spectrometry confirmed that band I derived from subunit B by identifying the peptides Ala102–Arg120, Gly271–Arg286, and Ala366–Arg379. When A1 was suspended in MgADP + Pi, the cross-link product I and a low amount of band V are obtained. In the presence of MgATP the bands I and V increased, and the new bands III, IV, and VI-VIII appeared, including the subunits A-A (III) and A-A-D (IV), respectively, and several forms of A-B oligomers (V-VIII). The A-A-D (IV) formation, which cannot be cleaved by DTT, was analyzed more precisely by MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 5). Ten peptides were unequivocally identified as bands deriving from either the N or C terminus of subunit D, together with five peptides of subunit A (see Table II). However, we were not able to monitor unequivocally the specific peptide of each subunit forming the linkage. This might be due to the incompleteness of in-gel tryptic digestion of the polypeptides (37.Svoboda M. Meister W. Vetter W. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1995; 30: 1562-1566Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which covers only 47.8 and 23.9% of the D and A sequence, respectively. The presence of MgADP leads to a slight decrease of the A-A-D (IV) formation and additionally to several closely spaced bands running just above band VIII, including A-B and A-A formations as shown by antibody blotting (Fig. 4 B). Consistently, the staining intensity of the A and B bands decreased in parallel with the occurrence of these A-B and A-A oligomer bands. These results rule out that MgATP was completely converted into MgADP or MgADP + Pi before cross-link formation under the conditions used, and it can be concluded that the differences in the fluorescence spectra seen above depend on whether MgATP or MgADP is bound in the nucleotide-binding site of the A1-ATPase. As shown by MALDI mass spectrometry, addition of MgADP leads to an intrinsic cross-link of the contaminant DnaK (band II). A cross-linked B product (I) and an A-B oligomer formation (V) were also formed in the presence of the A1 inhibitor dienestrol (17.Lemker T. Ruppert C. Stöger H. Wimmers S. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and under atmospheric oxygen without CuCl2 as shown by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 C).

Open table in a new tab Recently, limited tryptic digestion of A1 has shown that the subunits A–C are cleaved most rapidly, leading to the fragments A1–4, B1, C1, followed by F, which becomes cleaved into fragment F1, whereby subunit D remains shielded by the complex (14.Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cleavage products and their intensities were the same as observed upon trypsin treatment of A1 in the presence of 5 mm MgAMP-PNP (Fig. 6 A), with subunit F cleaved into fragment F1 after 20 min (data not shown). In contrast, there is slow cleavage of these subunits with MgATP or MgADP. Subunit C, which completely vanishes in the absence (14.Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Coskun Ü. Lemker T. Koch M.H.J. Schägger H. Müller V. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 1890-1896Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or presence of MgAMP-PNP after 50 min, is slowly cleaved when MgATP or MgADP is added to the enzyme. There is, however, a slight difference in cleavage of this stalk subunit depending on whether MgATP or MgADP is bound. Quantitation of the scanned C-bands indicate that 43 and 59.4% of this subunit remained after 70 min when MgATP or MgADP, respectively, is bound to the enzyme (Fig. 6 B). Proteolysis of A1after addition of MgADP + Pi leads to a time-dependent cleavage pattern in which only 4.7% of subunit C remained after 70 min. Furthermore, under this nucleotide condition the subunits A, B, and F also become more accessible to trypsin than in the presence of MgATP or MgADP. Interestingly, the cleavage pattern of the MgADP + Pi-bound A1-complex is quite comparable with the feature seen when MgAMP-PNP is present. This is in agreement with the results of Cu2+-induced cross-link formations described above when MgADP + Pi or MgAMP-PNP are bound to the enzyme. X-ray solution scattering was used to investigate the influence of nucleotide binding to the quaternary structure of the A1-ATPase from M. mazei Gö1. Binding of the uncleaved MgATP (obtained by adding MgAMP-PNP) causes a slight decrease of the radius of gyration of this complex, consistent with the observation on the closely related F1FO-ATPase from E. coli, where the diameter of the F1complex decreases upon MgAMP-PNP binding as determined by three-dimensional reconstructions (38.Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of the hydrolyzable MgATP, MgADP + Pi, and MgADP increase the radii of gyration. Conformational changes of the quaternary and tertiary structure of the related F1 due to nucleotide binding are in line with the most recent crystallographic model of bovine F1-ATPase, indicating changes of the quaternary and tertiary structure of the complex (39.Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Depending on the nucleotide bound to one of the catalytic β subunits significant changes of the lower part of the nucleotide binding domain and the C-terminal domain have been observed. Superposition of the so-called βDP, βTP, and βADP+Pisubunits of the bovine F1-ATPase (39.Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) indicate a 33° rotation of the C-terminal domain of βADP+Pi when compared with βDP and significant changes in backbone torsion angles in regions of the nucleotide binding domain. Incorporation of the fluorescent label CM into the nucleotide-binding site A and B of A1, as described above, provides strong evidence for rearrangements of these subunits, which also suggests that the small but systematic differences observed in SAXS are significant. Addition of MgADP causes a significant fluorescent enhancement and blue shift, whereas the binding of MgAMP-PNP only increases the signal. In contrast, the presence of MgADP + Pi results in a quenching of the signal, suggesting that structural changes in and around the bound CM occur in response to ATP binding and subsequent bond cleavage to ADP and Pi. The nucleotide-induced rearrangement of the major subunits A and B is also confirmed by the quantity of Cu2+-induced A-B dimers or the formation of A-B oligomers. The formation of A-B oligomers reflects the proximity of these subunits, which are proposed to alternate around a cavity in a hexameric fashion, thereby locating the nucleotide-binding sites at their interfaces (2.Schäfer G. Engelhard M. Müller V. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 570-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Schäfer G. Meyering-Vos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Significantly, A-A dimers can be observed even though separated by an intervening B subunit. Close proximity of the related α and β subunits of the F1-ATPase has also been demonstrated by α-α or β-β products formed via disulfide bridges of the N or C terminus, respectively (35.Tsunoda S.P. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Yoshida M. Noji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5701-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41.Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Like in the closely related V-ATPases, the A1 subunit A contains a region of 80–90 additional amino acids near the N terminus (5.Hilario E. Gogarten J.P. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6.Marin I. Fares M.A. Gonzáles-Candelas F. Barrio E. Moya A. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18843-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This extension is assumed to be located at the top of the three A subunits, forming protuberances as described for the V-ATPase (10.Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8609-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13.Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, depending on nucleotide binding to the catalytic A subunits, these protuberances might come in close contact thereby facilitating an A-A formation. A key finding of the present study is that subunit D can be cross-linked to the catalytic A subunit depending on nucleotide binding. The A-D formation occurs after addition of MgADP and to a small amount in the presence of the hydrolyzable MgATP but not in the presence of MgADP + Pi, MgAMP-PNP, or the absence of nucleotides. The interaction between the subunits A and D involves the N and C termini of D, indicating their close proximity to the catalytic A subunit. It is of particular interest that neither of the termini of D contain Cys residues and that the cross-linked formation cannot be disrupted by reducing agents, which rules out that the A-D product would be generated by disulfide bond formation. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the peptides from subunit D reveals the presence of a His27 and a Tyr184 residue at the N and C termini of this subunit, respectively, both candidates to form a thioether bridge with a cysteinyl residue. Such covalent linkage of the sulfur of a Cys with an imidazole ring of a His residue or with a Tyr residue has been identified as an essential formation in the tyrosinase from Neurospora crassa (43.Lerch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6414-6419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the galactose oxidase from Dactylium dendroides (44.Ito N. Phillips S.E.V. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J.

Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This close proximity of subunits A and D would allow coupling between the catalytic site events in A via D into the central stalk, which provides the physical and structural linkage between the A3B3 headpiece and the ion-conducting complex (2.Schäfer G.

Taken together, the results above provide several lines of evidence suggesting that, depending on the nucleotides bound to them, subunits A and B of the A1-ATPase change conformation and/or their interactions with structural alterations in the stalk subunits C, D, and F. The nucleotide dependence suggests also that there is a tight interaction of the D subunit at its catch region with the A subunit upon MgADP binding, which is broken when MgAMP-PNP is bound. Such binding followed by release may play a part in coupling the catalytic sites with the stalk region and the membrane-bound ion channel. We thank R.

https://openalex.org/W2034384756,"Neuropsin involved in neural plasticity in adult mouse brain is a member of the S1 (clan SA) family of serine proteases and forms characteristic surface loops surrounding the substrate-binding site (Kishi, T., Kato, M., Shimizu, T., Kato, K., Matsumoto, K., Yoshida, S., Shiosaka, S., and Hakoshima, T. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 4220–4224). Little, however, is known about the roles of these loops. Thus, the present study investigated whether surface loop structures of neuropsin were essential for the generation of enzymatic activity and/or secretion of the enzyme via a regulated secretory pathway. The loops include those stabilized by six disulfide bonds or a loop C (Gly69–Glu80) and anN-glycosylated kallikrein loop (His91–Ile103) not containing a site linked by a disulfide bond. First, among the six disulfide bonds, only SS1 in loop E (Gly142–Leu155) and SS6 in loop G (Ser185–Gly197) were necessary for the catalytic efficiency of neuropsin. Second, disruptions of loop C and the N-linked oligosaccharide chain on the kallikrein loop affected the catalytic efficiency and P2 specificity, respectively. Alternatively, disruptions of loop C and the kallikrein loop enhanced the regulated secretion, whereas there was no one disruption that inhibited the secretion, indicating that there was no critical loop required for the regulated secretion among loops surrounding the substrate-binding site. Neuropsin involved in neural plasticity in adult mouse brain is a member of the S1 (clan SA) family of serine proteases and forms characteristic surface loops surrounding the substrate-binding site (Kishi, T., Kato, M., Shimizu, T., Kato, K., Matsumoto, K., Yoshida, S., Shiosaka, S., and Hakoshima, T.

Several serine proteases have been shown to play important roles in synaptic plasticity (1.Baranes D. Lederfein D. Huang Y.-Y. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

These functions are suggested to be mediated by the activation of specific cell surface receptors and the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules (4.Nakagami Y.

The crystal structure of neuropsin has a serine protease fold that exhibits chimeric features of trypsin and nerve growth factor-γ, a member of the kallikrein family (Fig. 1 A) (9.Kishi T. Kato M.

All S1 serine proteases possess two β-barrels with a catalytic His57 (chymotrypsin position number), Asp102, and Ser195 located at the interface of the two domains (10.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 5-283Google Scholar). These proteases, however, show diversity in the structures of surface loops surrounding the substrate-binding site, and it has been proposed that this diversity controls the specificity of enzymatic activity (9.Kishi T.

Four to six disulfide bonds form, which probably provide a degree of structural rigidity to the loop structures (9.Kishi T. Kato M. Shimizu T. Kato K. Matsumoto K. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Hakoshima T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4797-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Neuropsin possesses six disulfide bonds, the same as trypsin. Furthermore, neuropsin forms a loop C (Gly69–Glu80) and an N-glycosylated loop D (17.Takahashi N. Tsukamoto Y. Shiosaka S. Kishi T. Hakoshima T. Arata Y. Yamaguchi Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the “kallikrein loop” (His91–Ile103), not containing a site linked by a disulfide bond. The loop C of neuropsin has been superimposed on that of trypsin and nerve growth factor-γ (9.Kishi T. Kato M. Shimizu T. Kato K. Matsumoto K. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4220-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18.Bartunik H.D. Summers L.J. Bartsch H.H. J. Mol.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the kallikrein loop is present in all members of the kallikrein family but not trypsin. However, the kallikrein loop of neuropsin differs radically from that of nerve growth factor-γ and of kallikrein (9.Kishi T. Kato M. Shimizu T. Kato K. Matsumoto K. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4220-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19.Bax B. Blundell T.L. Murray-Rust J. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 1997; 5: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). While the loop of most members of the kallikrein family is cleaved into highly mobile nicked chains, that of neuropsin is packed without any nicked sites. This three-dimensional view of neuropsin provides the opportunity to examine the correlation between structure and substrate specificity (9.Kishi T. Kato M. Shimizu T. Kato K. Matsumoto K. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4220-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it is necessary to evaluate the correlation experimentally. Most family S1 (clan SA) serine proteases are synthesized as precursors and then enter the secretory pathway (10.Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 5-283Google Scholar). It has been indicated that some are sorted to a regulated secretory pathway (20.Burgess T.L. Craik C.S. Matsuuchi L. Kelly R.B. J.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the secretion of trypsinogen, elastase, and cathepsin G is clearly regulated (20.Burgess T.L. Craik C.S. Matsuuchi L. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21.Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas it is debatable whether kallikrein is secreted in a regulated manner (24.Sawyer N. Rondeau N. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25.Peters J. Takahashi S. Tada M. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which domain of these proteases is involved in regulated secretion. On the other hand, there is physiological evidence that neuropsin is involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (2.Komai S. Matsuyama T. Matsumoto K. Kato K. Kobayashi M. Imamura K. Yoshida S. Ugawa S. Shiosaka S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3.Davies B. Kearns I.R. Ure J. Davies C.H. Lathe R. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether neuropsin is secreted in response to stimuli. It is, thus, necessary to determine whether a secretagogue causes exocytotic release of neuropsin and, if so, which domain of neuropsin is required for regulated secretion. In the present study, site-directed removal involving six disulfide bonds, a loop C, and an N-glycosylated kallikrein loop of neuropsin was carried out, and the effects of these mutations on the enzymatic activity and the regulated secretion were investigated. pED1-NP was constructed as follows. A 789-bp NcoI-XhoI fragment of a full-length neuropsin cDNA was amplified based on NP1-pBluescript(II)KS+ (6.Chen Z.-L. Yoshida S. Kato K. Momota Y. Suzuki J. Tanaka T. Ito J. Nishino H. Aimoto S.

Mayumi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), to generate pED1-NP. Point mutations were introduced into a full-size neuropsin cDNA of pED1-NP by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using Mutan-Super Express K m according to the manufacturer's protocol (TaKaRa, Siga, Japan). The numerals in the clone names indicate the amino acid number counted from the start codon, Met. The following primers were used, and the nucleotides changed relative to the neuropsin cDNA sequence are underlined: C7S, 5′-CCC CCA CCC TCT GCA ATC CA-3′; C39S, 5′-AGG TCG AGA GTC TAT ACC CCA C-3′; C74S, 5′-AGC CCA CTC CAA AAA ACA G-3′; C108S, 5′-GCA TCC TTC CTA CAA CAA C-3′; C145S, 5′-CCA ATC TGTCTC CCA AAG TTG GCC AGA AG-3′; C152S, 5′-TTG GCC AGA AGTCCA TCA TAT CAG G-3′; C198S, 5′-AGG GCA TGG TCTCTG CTG GCA GCA G-3′; C208S, 5′-TGA CAC GTC CCA GGG TG-3′; C233S, 5′-TCA GAC CCC TCT GGG AAA CCC G-3′; C246S, 5′-ACA CCA AAA TCT CCC GCT ACA CTA CC-3′; N110A, 5′-TCC TTG CTA CGC CAA CAG CAA CCC-3′; D206V, 5′-TGG AGC TGT CAC GTG CC-3′; DS211VA, 5′-TGG AGC TGA CAC GTG CCA GGG TGT CGC AGG AGG CCC-3′. Deletion mutants of Δ(S87-P94) and N110S·Δ(N113-E115) were created by PCR with NP1-pBluescript(II)KS+ (6.Chen Z.-L. Yoshida S. Kato K. Momota Y. Suzuki J. Tanaka T. Ito J. Nishino H. Aimoto S.

PCR fragments of 250 bp ofNcoI-EcoO65I (forward, T7 primer; reverse, 5′-ATGGTC ACC CAG ACG CAC G-3′) and 509 bp ofEcoO65I-XhoI (forward, 5′-TAC TCC GTG CGT CTG GGT GAC CAT GAG CAG GAG ATC CAG GTG GC-3′; reverse, primer-A) were inserted into the NcoI-XhoI site of pED1 to generate Δ(S87-P94). PCR fragments of 328 bp ofNcoI-NspV (forward, T7 primer; reverse, 5′-GTTCGAATA GCA AGG ATG CTG GAT AGA-3′) and 446 bp of NspV-XhoI (forward, 5′-TCT ATC CAG CAT CCT TGC TATTCG AAC AGC GAT CAC AGT CAC GAT ATA ATG-3′; reverse, primer-A) were inserted into theNcoI-XhoI site of pED1 to generate N110S·Δ(N113-E115). pSlhGH vector encoding human growth hormone was described previously (28.Itakura M.

The Neuro2a cell line (mouse neuroblastoma; Institute for Fermentation, Osaka, Japan) was grown in Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Neuro2a cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 104/cm2(1.0 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) in Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, and 1% nonessential amino acids on a coverslip (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) coated with poly-l-lysine (4 μg/cm2; Sigma). After 18 h, cells were transfected with 1 μg of pED1-NP and the mutants in OPTI-MEM plus 1% nonessential amino acids by LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). After 3 h, the medium was replaced with fresh OPTI-MEM plus 1% nonessential amino acids containing N-2 supplement (differentiation) (Invitrogen). Conditioned medium (2 ml/35-mm dish) was recovered after 36 h of culture for the enzyme assay. The PC12 cell line (a gift from Dr. Yasuhisa Hukui, University of Tokyo, Japan) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum at 37 °C in a 10% CO2incubator. PC12 cells were plated at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/cm2 (1.2 × 106cells/35-mm dish) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5% horse serum on a dish coated with polyethyleneimine (Sigma). After 18 h, cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pSIhGH and 1.5 μg of pED1-neuropsin by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, assays of hGH and neuropsin release were performed. Media and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was reacted with rabbit anti-neuropsin polyclonal antibody (11pAb) (8.Kato K. Kishi T. Kamachi T. Akisada M. Oka T. Midorikawa R. Takio K. Dohmae N. Bird P.I. Sun J. Scott F. Miyake Y.

The secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Immun-Star Substrate, Bio-Rad), followed by exposure to x-ray film. The amount of mutant and wild-type protein was determined based on the band densities using one-dimensional gel image analysis software (Quantity One software, PDI, Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) (8.Kato K.

For comparison of the activity of 11pAb to bind mutants and wild-type neuropsin, conditioned medium derived from each transfectant was immunoprecipitated with Affi-Gel Hz beads (Bio-Rad) conjugated with F12mAb (7.Momota Y. Yoshida S. Ito J. Shibata M. Kato K. Sakurai K. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka S. Eur. J.

There was no difference in the band density of mutants and wild-type neuropsin by Western blotting with 11pAb per μg of protein contents (data not shown). The amidolytic activity of neuropsin was determined basically as described previously (29.Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T.

Briefly, conditioned media of Neuro2a cells transfected with mutants and wild-type neuropsin were treated with lysyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.50) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) conjugated with Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 15 min, and then the amount of mutant and wild-type neuropsin in the medium was determined based on the band density, following reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To determine the amidolytic activity, 12.5–200 mmBoc-Val-Pro-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA), Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA, Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA, and Boc-Asp (benzyloxy)-Pro-Arg-MCA (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan) were mixed with 50 nm mutant and wild-type neuropsin in 96-well plates (Corning Costar, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction proceeded at 25 °C for 0–60 min at 3-min intervals in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% NaN3 and was monitored with a multiwell plate reader (Cytofluor II, PerSeptive Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). The kinetic parameters K mand k cat were obtained by linear regression analysis of the Lineweaver-Burk plot. After 48 h of gene transfection, PC12 cells were washed four times with a low K+ solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmKCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). They were incubated for 2 min with the low K+ solution and then for 2 min with a high K+ solution (140 mmNaCl, 59.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4), and each medium was recovered. Cell lysates were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 0.2 mm EDTA using a sonicator (Ultrasonic Homogenizer, VP-5S, TAITEC, Co., Ltd., Saitama, Japan) and centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 5 min, and then the supernatant was collected.

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.7 mmCaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2, at 4 °C for 1 h and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm glycine, and phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 10 min. After a wash with 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mmboric acid, and 5 mm sodium tetraborate decahydrate, pH 8.0 (BBS), cells were incubated with BBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min and then with primary antibodies in BBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After a wash with BBS, secondary antibodies in BBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin were applied at 4 °C overnight. After a wash with BBS, coverslips were mounted in glycerol-containing Mowiol 4–88 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) and 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane (Sigma) (33.Harlow E. Lane D.

Double-labeled immunofluorescence cytochemistry with anti-Grp78, anti-α-mannosidase II, and anti-chromogranin A antibodies was used to observe the localization of mutant and wild-type neuropsin on the endoplasmic reticulum (30.Huovila A.-P.J.

To investigate the role of the surface loop structure of neuropsin in enzymatic activity and secretion, site-directed mutagenesis was employed in loop C (Gly69–Glu80), theN-glycosylated kallikrein loop (His91–Ile103), and six disulfide bonds (Fig. 1 B). Neuro2a cells transiently transfected with mutant and wild-type neuropsin cDNA were cultured for 36 h. Disruption of the disulfide bonds SS2, SS4, and SS5 interrupted the secretion and caused the enzymes to distribute in the endoplasmic reticulum but not the Golgi complex (data not shown). Since the results show quality control of the enzymes, they were uninformative with regard to the enzymatic activity and secretion. Twelve mutants and the wild-type neuropsin had little amidolytic activity without treatment by lysyl endopeptidase (data not shown) (29.Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K.

Mutations in Asp189 (D206V; S1-specific pocket) and Ser195 (DS211VA; catalytic triad) lacking a protease active pocket resulted in levels of activity ∼200- and ∼800-fold less than the wild type as measured byk cat/K m, respectively (Table I, lines 3 and 4). Alternatively, C208S (SS6) and C233S (SS6), had 70–200-fold less activity than the wild type (Table I, lines 12 and 13), the k cat values being ∼200-fold less than and the K m values almost the same as the wild-type values. Disruptions of loop C (Δ(S87-P94)) and of a disulfide bond SS1 (C39S) caused hydration of the substrate to occur 22 times more slowly than for the wild-type (Table I, lines 5 and 10). Both loop C (Δ(S87-P94)) and C39S (SS1) showed a decrease ink cat values and increase inK m values, indicating that loop C (Gly69–Glu80) and SS1 were necessary for catalytic efficiency. The remaining mutants showed little difference in activity on Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA, relative to the wild-type. The three-dimensional view has revealed that the kallikrein loop of neuropsin forms a narrow P2 pocket (9.Kishi T. Kato M. Shimizu T. Kato K. Matsumoto K. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Hakoshima T. J. Biol.

AMP induces the transition from the active R-state to the inactive (or less active) T-state. Substrates or products in combination with metal cations stabilize the R-state conformation.

The enzyme is active if loop 52–72 can cycle between its engaged and disordered conformations. Fluorescence from a tryptophan reporter group at position 57 is consistent with the conformational states for loop 52–72, observed in crystal structures (17Nelson S.W. Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V.

Presumably, the engaged, disengaged, and disordered conformations of loop 52–72 are possible in both the R- and T-states of FBPase, but only the engaged and disordered conformers of the R-state, and the disengaged conformer of the T-state, have been reported in crystalline complexes (16Choe J.Y.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).A central question remains concerning the allosteric regulation of FBPase: By what mechanism does AMP cooperativity occur in the allosteric inhibition of FBPase? Lipscomb and colleagues (21Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have described potential routes of AMP communication across two different subunit interfaces (C1 to C4 and C1 to C2; Fig.1). In addition, interactions of the N-terminal segment could provide yet another pathway of communication between subunits C1 and C2 (19Ke H.M. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B. Lipscomb W.N. Marcus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutations of residues throughout the enzyme, including both interfaces and loop 52–72, have eliminated AMP cooperativity. In many instances, however, significant changes in kinetic parameters and/or mechanisms that accompany the loss of AMP cooperativity thwart definitive conclusions.Hetero-oligomers, or hybrids, of an otherwise homo-oligomeric protein can be used to great advantage in dissecting mechanisms of thermodynamic coupling between ligands. Hybrid constructs of aspartate carbamoyltransferase have revealed pathways of signal propagation and conformational changes due to the binding of allosteric effectors (22Gibbons I. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Gibbons I. Ritchey J.M. Schachman H.K.

Hybrid enzymes of lactate dehydrogenase fromBifidobacterium longum have demonstrated a concerted transition between the R- and T-states of that enzyme (26Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2971-2976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).On the basis of previous work, distinct homotetramers of FBPase, when combined under the appropriate conditions, undergo spontaneous subunit exchange to form hybrid tetramers. Anion-exchange chromatography cleanly separates most of the hybrid constructs (28Nelson S.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). More recently, Kantrowitz and colleagues (29Kelley-Loughnane N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins. 2001; 44: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported that AMP must bind to two subunits of FBPase to cause significant inhibition. They were unable to investigate the origin of AMP cooperativity, however, because their system was an unresolved mixture of three distinct 2:2 hybrid tetramers (29Kelley-Loughnane N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins. 2001; 44: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our motivation for developing an in vitro subunit exchange protocol lay in its potential to exercise control over the formation and separation of hybrid tetramers. As distinct 2:2 hybrids can be isolated by protocols presented here, specific pathways of cooperativity can be tested. The kinetic and equilibrium binding data presented here show that one molecule of AMP must bind to each half (top/bottom) of the FBPase tetramer to promote cooperative AMP inhibition; however, AMP molecules bound to the same half of the tetramer can still elicit complete allosteric inhibition without cooperativity. Furthermore, the ligation of AMP molecules to any pair of subunits of the tetramer will promote an R- to T-transition.DISCUSSIONKinetic parameters (kcat, ratio of activities at pH 7.5 and 9.5, Km for F16P2, Ka for Mg2+, Hill coefficient for Mg2+, and Ki for F26P2) and kinetic mechanisms of inhibition are virtually identical for hybrid and wild-type enzymes (Table I). Henceforth the discussion will focus on the two phenomena that differ: AMP cooperativity and AMP inhibition.Cooperativity can be a property of the entire oligomer, in which case the Hill coefficient varies smoothly with the number of functional ligand binding sites in hybrid constructs. Such is the case for hybrids of lactate dehydrogenase from Bacillus longum (26Fushinobu S. Kamata K. Iwata S. Sakai H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25611-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if the mechanism of cooperativity relies on the integrity of a specific subunit interface, then mutations at that interface should eliminate cooperativity, whereas mutations elsewhere should have no effect. Cooperativity in the binding of NAD to tetrameric glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, for instance, is sensitive to the O–P interface (36Roitel O. Sergienko E. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16084-16091Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Neither of these scenarios, however, applies to FBPase. The lack of cooperativity in AMP inhibition of the 2:2p hybrid indicates no participation by the C1–C2 interface in this phenomenon. On the other hand, the 0:4 hybrid (Glu-tagged homotetramer) and the 1:3 hybrid (1 subunit AMP−:3 subunits Glu-tagged) have Hill coefficients for AMP of 2.0 and 1.6, respectively, suggesting some correlation between the number of functional binding sites and the Hill coefficient. If 2:2 hybrids can have cooperativity no greater than that of the 1:3 hybrid, then the Hill coefficient of 1.5 for the 2:2q/2:2r hybrid mixture requires either one of the hybrids (2:2q or 2:2r) is dominant and cooperative or that both hybrids are cooperative.Of the two possibilities, mentioned above, the latter is most probable. To have the formation of say the 2:2q hybrid, but not the 2:2r hybrid, requires either a bias in the equilibrium distribution of hybrids or a bias in the kinetics of subunit exchange. Although the relative areas of peaks in the elution profile of Fig. 2A are not consistent with a binomial distribution, we see no evidence that would suggest a thermodynamic bias so large as to exclude the formation of any specific hybrid. Furthermore, we can envision a mechanism of subunit exchange that discriminates against the formation of both hybrids 2:2q and 2:2r, but no mechanism that leads to the formation of just one of these hybrids. Therefore, the data here infer comparable levels of each hybrid in the 2:2q/2:2r mixture and, hence, that both the 2:2q and 2:2r hybrids must have nearly equal AMP cooperativity.Directed mutations that alter AMP cooperativity in a homotetramer of FBPase generally do not support a definitive conclusion regarding the mechanism of cooperativity (37Shyur L.-F.

One can infer little regarding cooperativity in a kinetic mechanism, if the mechanism itself is changed by the experiment. Indeed, the mutation of Lys50 to methionine has no effect on kinetic mechanisms and little or no effect on kinetic parameters, including AMP cooperativity (41Shyur L.-F. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B.

Mutations of Arg49 and Lys50 that result in significant functional perturbations are due most likely to their influence on the conformational dynamics of loop 52–72.

The introduction of proline at position 50 dramatically alters the mechanism of AMP inhibition and, on the basis of fluorescence spectroscopy, greatly changes the conformational dynamics of loop 52–72 (45Nelson S.W.

In contrast, the 2:2p hybrid preserves all of the kinetic properties of the wild-type enzyme, save AMP cooperativity.There are, however, mutations that eliminate AMP cooperativity with only modest effects on other kinetic parameters. Mutations of Lys42, Ile190, Gly191, and Glu192 (residues at the C1–C4 interface) are such examples (39Shyur L.-F. Aleshin A.E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 297: 5076-5081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The above mutants of FBPase exhibit biphasic inhibition by AMP: maximal inhibition of substantially less than 100% at low concentrations of AMP (<10 μm), followed by complete inhibition at concentrations of AMP >10 mm. Lu et al. (38Shyur L.-F. Aleshin A.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7492-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) concluded that such biphasic AMP inhibition is a consequence of lost AMP cooperativity. The 2:2p hybrid, however, has no AMP cooperativity and no biphasic AMP inhibition. An alternative model by Nelson et al. (13Nelson S.W. Kurbanov F. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) accounts for biphasic AMP inhibition as a failure to stabilize the disengaged conformation of loop 52–72. Hence, catalysis in the presence of AMP arises from the T-state of FBPase, and the observed maximal inhibition at low concentrations of AMP is due to the transition from an active R-state to a less active T-state. The later model accounts for biphasic AMP inhibition but says nothing regarding the mechanism of AMP cooperativity.Of the several mutations that eliminate AMP cooperativity in homotetramers of FBPase, the mutation of Arg22 to methionine perhaps makes the most compelling case for the participation of a specific subunit interface in the mechanism of AMP cooperativity. Met22 FBPase exhibits no cooperativity in AMP inhibition yet retains all other wild-type kinetic mechanisms and parameters (37Shyur L.-F. Aleshin A.E. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3005-3010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Arg22 (of subunit C1) hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyl 27 (of subunit C4) in the T-state of wild-type FBPase. This intersubunit hydrogen bond is absent, however, in the R-state. The absence of AMP cooperativity in Met22 FBPase implicates the top/bottom (C1–C4/C2–C3) interface in the phenomenon. As the top/bottom interface extends the entire width of the FBPase tetramer (Fig. 1), the coupling mechanism responsible for cooperativity can involve any pair of AMP molecules bound to opposite sides of the interface. The observation of cooperativity in the 2:2q/2:2r hybrid mixture and its absence in the 2:2p hybrid is fully consistent with a mutation that evidently severs communications between the top and bottom halves of the FBPase tetramer.Although AMP cooperativity may not be inseparably linked to allosteric inhibition, as noted above, AMP affinity and cooperativity are correlated phenomena. Cooperativity is highest and IC50 for AMP is lowest in the 0:4 hybrid (Glu-tagged homotetramer). As the number of AMP− subunits increases in the hybrid, the Hill coefficient declines and IC50 for AMP rises. The 1:3 hybrid and the 2:2q/2:2r hybrid mixture are the exceptions to this trend. In fact, the kinetic properties of the 1:3 hybrid and 2:2q/2:2r hybrid mixture are nearly identical, whereas the 2:2p hybrid has no cooperativity and an IC50 for AMP some 6-fold higher. Evidently, potent and cooperative AMP inhibition of FBPase requires at least one AMP molecule bound to each half (top/bottom) of the tetramer. This finding is in harmony with evidence for pairs of high and low affinity sites for AMP on wild-type FBPase (46El-McGrane M.M. Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10445-10454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The fluorescence data infer a common R-state conformation for hybrids and a global conformational change induced by saturating concentrations of AMP. The Trp57 reporter group behaves as if the 1:3 and 2:2 hybrids are undergoing the same R- to T-state transition as observed in the wild-type enzyme. The 12-fold rise inKd for AMP, exhibited by the 2:2p hybrid relative to theTrp57 homotetramer, reflects most likely the diversion of more AMP binding energy to promote the R- to T-state transition. Hence, one molecule of AMP ligated to each half (top/bottom) of the tetramer is more effective in driving the R- to T-state transition, than a pair of AMP molecules bound to the same half of the tetramer. A 3:1 hybrid (3 subunits AMP−:1 subunit Glu-tagged) of FBPase is poorly inhibited by AMP (IC50 of 340 μm) and, on the basis of fluorescence spectroscopy, cannot drive the R- to T-transition. Data here from thermodynamics and kinetics then are in substantial agreement: Potent and cooperative inhibition of FBPase occurs by the binding of one AMP molecule to each of the bottom and top halves of the tetramer, driving an R- to T-state transition.These findings indicate two possible pathways of allosteric inhibition: a cooperative pathway, triggered by the binding of a pair of AMP molecules to opposites sides of the top/bottom interface, and a noncooperative pathway, triggered by the binding of a pair of AMP molecules to the same side of the top/bottom interface. Given the relative IC50 values for AMP inhibition of the 2:2 hybrid tetramers, AMP prefers binding to opposite sides of the top/bottom interface. Formycin A 5′-monophosphate (FMP) and 2′(3′)-O-(trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-monophosphate, however, cause complete allosteric inhibition with no cooperativity (7Scheffler J.E. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6659-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,45Nelson S.W. Choe J.-Y. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29986-29992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For reasons unknown, the later effectors may prefer binding to the same side of the top/bottom interface of the wild-type tetramer, and thus the absence of cooperativity in allosteric inhibition. Crystal structures of human FBPase, fully ligated with AMP and with FMP, however, reveal no discernable differences (47Iversen L.F. Brzozowski M. Hastrup S. Hubbard R. Kastrup J.S. Larsen I.K. Nærun L. Nørskov-Lauridsen L. Rasmussen P.B. Thim L. Wiberg F.C. Lundgren K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, differences in AMP and FMP complexes of FBPase must lie in partially ligated states of the enzyme, a conclusion at least consistent with the observed functional properties of the 2:2 hybrid tetramers.Ackers et al. (48Ackers G.K. Doyle M.L. Myers D. Daugherty M.A. Science. 1992; 255: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) have proposed a “symmetry rule” governing the transition of hemoglobin from its T- to R-states. The hemoglobin tetramer is composed of two αβ dimers. The association of at least one ligand to each of the αβ dimers of the hemoglobin tetramer favors a T- to R-state transition. In contrast, the R- to T-state transition for FBPase occurs whether ligands bind to opposite halves or to the same half of the tetramer.How then is it possible for AMP to promote an R- to T-state transition in FBPase with and without cooperativity? A possible explanation appears in Fig. 7, where ΔGb is the free energy change in the ligation of AMP to an “isolated subunit” of FBPase, ΔGtert is the free energy penalty in overcoming tertiary conformational restraints due to the assembly of the “isolated subunit” into an R-state relative to a T-state tetramer, and ΔGRT is the free energy penalty in overcoming quaternary conformational restraints in the R- to T-state transition. Because unligated and singly ligated tetramers favor the R-state, ΔGRT > ΔGtert. Because doubly ligated tetramers are in the T-state, however, 2ΔGtert > ΔGRT. The last two inequalities can be combined: 2ΔGRT > 2ΔGtert > ΔGRT. Cooperative binding of AMP to the 2:2q hybrid tetramer requires only that ΔGb + ΔGtert > ΔGb + ΔGRT − ΔGtert, or equivalently, 2ΔGtert > ΔGRT, which clearly agrees with the relative free energies of unligated, singly ligated, and doubly ligated FBPases.Figure 7Thermodynamics of cooperative (left) and noncooperative (right) inhibition of 2:2 hybrid tetramers of FBPase by AMP. Free energy terms ΔGb, ΔGtert, ΔGRT, and ΔGp are defined in the text. AMP cannot bind to subunits withcrosses. R-state subunits are rounded, whereas T-state subunits have corners. Predominant forms of the tetramer in solution at equilibrium are represented with bold outlines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To account for noncooperative binding of AMP, we assume a thermodynamic penalty (ΔGp in Fig. 7) in the binding of two AMP molecules to the same half of the tetramer. Such a thermodynamic penalty is consistent with the weaker binding affinity of the third and fourth molecules of AMP to the wild-type tetramer (46El-McGrane M.M. Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10445-10454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Noncooperative binding of AMP then requires ΔGb + ΔGtert = ΔGb + ΔGRT − ΔGtert + ΔGp, or equivalently, 2ΔGtert = ΔGRT + ΔGp. This latter equality and the former combined inequality (2ΔGRT > 2ΔGtert > ΔGRT) together require only that ΔGRT > ΔGp > 0, which is a plausible condition. Hence, the same allosteric effector of FBPase can promote an R- to T-state transition by way of either cooperative or noncooperative binding pathways. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase, EC3.1.3.11; FBPase)1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16P2) to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (1Benkovic S.T. de Maine M.M.

FBPase, a key regulatory enzyme of the gluconeogenic pathway, is itself regulated indirectly through the action of glucagon and insulin and directly by the ligation of AMP and F26P2. AMP and F26P2 inhibit FBPase while simultaneously activating its counterpart in glycolysis, fructose-6-phosphate 1-kinase (3Van Schaftingen E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat.

Antithrombin requires the co-factor, heparin, to efficiently inhibit target proteinases. A specific pentasaccharide sequence (H5) in high affinity heparin induces a conformational change in antithrombin that is particularly important for factor Xa (fXa) inhibition. Thus, synthetic H5 accelerates the interaction between antithrombin and fXa 100-fold as compared with only 2-fold versus thrombin. We built molecular models and identified residues unique to the active site of fXa that we predicted were important for interacting with the reactive center loop of H5-activated antithrombin.

The x-ray crystal structure of fXa reveals that Gln61 forms part of the S1′ and S3′ pocket, suggesting that the P′ region of the reactive center loop of antithrombin is crucial for mediating the acceleration in the rate of inhibition of fXa by H5-activated antithrombin.

The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge at the point of the prothrombinase complex, of which fXa is a key component along with factor Va and phospholipids (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kiesel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The serpin antithrombin (ATIII) controls a number of important coagulation enzymes including fXa and thrombin with the aid of the co-factor, heparin (physiologically represented by heparan sulfate chains) (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin: Structure and Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 159-217Google Scholar). In the absence of heparin, ATIII is a relatively ineffective inhibitor of fXa and thrombin (kass [fXa] = 2.6 × 103m−1·s−1;kass [thrombin] = 1 × 104m−1·s−1 (3Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin accelerates the interaction between ATIII and target proteinases by two distinct mechanisms. First, long chain heparin is able to act as a “template,” to which both ATIII and the proteinase bind, bringing inhibitor and proteinase into close proximity (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Berliner L.J.

Second, a specific pentasaccharide sequence present in high affinity heparin (5Choay J. Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Sinay P. Casu B. Gatti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The template mechanism has been shown to be important for accelerating the interaction between ATIII and both thrombin and fXa (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin: Structure and Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 159-217Google Scholar, 5Choay J. Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Sinay P. Casu B. Gatti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In contrast, the conformational change induced by heparin pentasaccharide (H5) results in a 100-fold increase in the rate of interaction between ATIII and fXa, compared with only a 2-fold increase in the rate of interaction versus thrombin (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin: Structure and Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 159-217Google Scholar). Thus, synthetic H5 is able to “target” ATIII to fXa, and therefore this molecule is an important potential therapeutic that has just successfully completed phase II clinical trials for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (10Büller H.R. Circulation. 2000; 102 (The Rembrandt Investigators): 2726-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To understand why H5 is able to substantially accelerate the interaction between ATIII/fXa but not ATIII/thrombin, we built molecular models of these complexes and identified proteinase/serpin interactions in the fXa/ATIII complex that were absent in the thrombin/ATIII complex. Our modeling studies suggested that five residues in the active site of fXa made interactions specific to fXa/ATIII: Glu37, Glu39, Gln61, Ser173, and Phe174 (enzyme residues numbered according to equivalent positions in chymotrypsin). Site-directed mutants of these residues in human fXa were generated and tested for their susceptibility to inhibition by ATIII in the presence and absence of H5. The results demonstrate that mutation of one residue, Gln61, which forms part of the S1′ and S3′ pockets, 2Subsites and RCL residues are numbered according to the convention of Schechter and Berger (47Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thus, in addition to providing a molecular explanation of the acceleration effect, our data provide the first evidence that residues C-terminal to the reactive center of the serpin are involved in mediating the acceleration of inhibition.

The “mutate” facility within Quanta (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to change the sequence of the P7–P5′ of ecotin (SSPVSTMMHCPV) to that of the P7–P5′ region of the RCL of ATIII (AVVIAGRSLNPN). The structure of trypsin, all of the mutated ecotin apart from the P7–P5′ region, and the inhibitor Rpr208815 were then deleted to leave the structure of fXa with the P7–P5′ sequence of ATIII positioned in the active site. The structure of trypsin in complex with pancreatic trypsin inhibitor was superposed onto the model, and this structure was used as a template to correctly position the P1 Arg of ATIII into the S1 subsite of fXa. The edit sequence facility within Quanta was also used to add additional residues (P8 Thr, P9 Ser, P6′ Arg, and P7′ Val) to the P and P′ ends of our peptide. The entire model of fXa in complex with the P9–P7′ sequence of the RCL of ATIII was then subjected to CHARMm minimization, first with the proteinase and the backbone atoms of the peptide constrained and then later with no constraints. Minimization was performed to convergence. A Ramachrandran plot revealed that all residues in our modeled RCL peptide were in allowed conformations. Similar methods were used to build the model of thrombin in complex with the P9–P7′ region of the RCL of ATIII. Subsequent to the completion of the modeling and experimental studies described, the x-ray crystal structure of the Michaelis serpin-protease complex was determined by Ye et al. (1I99; Ref. 24Ye S. Cech A.L. Belmares R. Bergstrom R.C. Tong Y. Corey D.R. Kanost M.R. Goldsmith E.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to build a complete model of the complex between H5-activated antithrombin and human factor Xa using the structure of serpin 1K in complex with rat trypsin as a template. The structure of H5-activated antithrombin was first superposed onto the serpin 1K molecule in the Michaelis serpin-protease complex using the sequence alignment and superposition facilities available in Quanta (MSI Inc., San Diego). The two structures superposed with a root mean square deviation of 1.3 Å over 333 Cα atoms. We then used the structure of serpin 1K as a template to build a model of the RCL of antithrombin using the homology modeling tools available in Quanta. The RCL of antithrombin is one residue longer than that of serpin 1K, and hence one residue was inserted with respect to the template after P6′. To accommodate this extra residue, we performed a local refinement (using CHARMm) upon the region from P4′–P8′. In this way we obtained a model of antithrombin with the loop in a similar conformation to that seen in the x-ray crystal structure of the Michaelis serpin-protease complex. We superposed the x-ray crystal structure of human factor Xa (PDB code1F0R) onto the structure of rat trypsin portion of the Michaelis serpin-protease complex. The two structures superposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.42 Å over 183 Cα atoms. The structure of serpin 1K in complex with rat trypsin was then removed to leave a model of the Michaelis complex between antithrombin and factor Xa. Initial inspection of the preliminary model revealed two minor steric clashes (the first between the side chain of P9 and Glu147 in factor Xa and the second between Ser230 and Lys148 of factor Xa). No other steric clashes between the proteinase and the body of the serpin were observed. The final model was refined (and the two clashes resolved) using CHARMm, first with the backbone residues constrained and later with no constraints. The construction of the expression system for fX using the pNut vector will be described elsewhere. 3E. P. Bianchini, Y. B. Louvain, P.-E. Marque, M. A. Juliano, L. Juliano, and B. F. Le Bonniec, submitted for publication. The site-directed mutagenesis of the fX sequence in the pNut vector was accomplished by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using a PCR-based strategy. Several clones of each mutation in the pNut-fX vector were sequenced and analyzed for protein expression. Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with the wild type and mutant pNut-fX vectors. Stable cell lines were selected by the addition of 100 μm methotrexate to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 5 IU/ml penicillin, 5 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Isolated colonies were screened for fX expression by immunoassay and activity measurements. Serum-free medium containing the recombinant fX protein was applied to a nitrocellulose membrane and was probed using the monoclonal anti-human fX antibody (4 μg/ml). Clones that expressed the enzyme were detected by alkaline phosphatase color development. For large scale expression of the recombinant proteins, selected stable cell lines described above were allowed to reach 80% confluence before the medium type was changed to a phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (serum-free) that was supplemented with 5 IU/ml penicillin, 5 μg/ml of streptomycin, 100 μmmethotrexate, 10 μg/ml of vitamin K1, and 50 μm zinc sulfate. The media from the cells were collected every 48 h for five collections and were stored at −20 °C. Factor X was partially purified from the pooled media using the barium citrate purification method described previously (25Rudolph A.E. Mullane M.P. Porche-Sorbet R. Tsuda S. Miletich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28601-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fX protein was precipitated by the addition of 60 mm barium chloride, followed by the addition of 32 mm citrate. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 15 mm sodium citrate and was dialyzed overnight in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g and loaded onto a Hi-TrapTM Q column. fX was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of 0.15–1 mNaCl in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, over 50 ml. Sterile glycerol (final concentration, 10% (v/v)) was added, and the samples were aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at −70 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by silver staining or transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with a monoclonal anti-human fX antibody (4 μg/ml), and visualized with alkaline phosphatase detection. Factor X was activated by incubating with 100 nm Russell’s viper venom factor Xa activator for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) PEG 8000 (25Rudolph A.E. Mullane M.P. Porche-Sorbet R. Tsuda S. Miletich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28601-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All enzyme assays described henceforth were also performed in this assay buffer at 37 °C. The concentration of factor Xa was determined by an active site-specific immunoassay using biotinylated Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone as described previously (27Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16176-16181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Mann K.G. Williams E.B. Krishnaswamy S. Church W. Giles A. Tracy R.P. Blood. 1990; 76: 755-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of fXa was routinely measured by determining the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate IEGR-amc using wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm for excitation and emission, respectively, over 10 min using a BMG Fluorostar plate reader. For each of the fXa mutants, theKm values for the IEGR-amc substrate were determined by monitoring the change in fluorescence over a range of substrate concentrations (usually 1–200 μm). TheKm values for the EGR-amc substrate for fXaS173A, fXaF174A, and wild type fXa were determined by monitoring the change in fluorescence over a range of substrate concentrations (usually 1–500 μm). The initial rate of hydrolysis (ν) was plotted against the concentration of substrate, and the data were fitted to the equation: ν =Vmax [S]/(Km + [S]), where ν is the rate of change for a given concentration of substrate [S]. Second order rate constants for the association between fXa and ATIII were measured using discontinuous assays as described by Olson et al. (29Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using plasma-derived ATIII. A fixed concentration of fXa (1 nm) was incubated with 0.01–1.5 μm ATIII over various time periods. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 80 μm IEGR-amc substrate, and the residual amount of fXa activity was measured. In those reactions that contained H5, it was present at a concentration of at least 500 nm or in 5-fold excess over the ATIII concentration, whichever was the greater value. The natural log of the residual fXa activity was plotted versus time for each concentration of ATIII, the slope of the line yielding an observed rate of inhibition, kobs. Thekobs values were plotted against their corresponding ATIII concentration, and linear regression of the plots yielded the slope from which the kass for the reaction was obtained. The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) was determined with a fixed concentration of fXa (10–200 nm) with increasing molar ratios of ATIII to enzyme in the presence and absence of H5. These reactions were allowed to incubate to completion, and the residual fXa activity was measured, following which residual activity was plotted against the molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme. Linear regression analysis of the plotted values yields an intercept with thex axis, which in turn equates to the SI. The complexes formed between fXa and ATIII were analyzed by separation on a 10% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with a chicken anti-human ATIII antibody (7 μg/ml), and visualized by alkaline phosphatase detection. The hypothesis investigated in this study was that differences in the active site of thrombin and fXa render the latter enzyme more susceptible to inhibition by H5-activated ATIII. Thus, the objective of our modeling studies was to identify putative interactions between the RCL of ATIII and fXa that were absent in the thrombin/RCL model. To identify such residues, the two models were superposed, and the RCL/active site interactions in each were compared. It is important to note that residues that formed interactions with the modeled peptide but were conserved between the two enzymes were not targeted for site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, we did not investigate the position Gln192, which has been the subject of extensive investigation by others (30Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this section, we describe the putative interactions that were identified and the residues in fXa that were targeted for subsequent site-directed mutagenesis (Figs.1 and2).Figure 2Interactions between residues in the active site of factor Xa and the reactive center loop of antithrombin as predicted by computer modeling studies. A, model of the complex between human factor Xa (gray) and the RCL of antithrombin (red). The side chain atoms of the P8, P4, P1′, P3′, and P6′ residues are in green ball and stick and are labeled. The P1 residue is shown in yellow ball and stick. Residues that were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis in this study are in cyan ball and stick and are labeled. Hydrogen bonds are represented by dashed black lines. The two residues (Tyr99 and Trp215) that together with Phe174 form the S4 specificity pocket are shown inmagenta ball and stick. B, stereo diagram showing the predicted interaction between residue Gln61 and the side chain of P1′ and P3′. Residues P1–P4′ of the RCL of antithrombin are in green stick. The P1, P1′, and P3′ residues are labeled. Shown in red is the 60 loop of factor Xa, with Gln61 in red stick. The two predicted hydrogen bonds to the side chain of P1′ and P3′ are represented by black dashed lines. We predict that Gln61 may be able to form an alternative conformation, which is shown in magenta. In this conformation we predict that Gln61 is able to form a hydrogen bond to the backbone N of P1′ (represented by the blue dashed line). The 60 loop of thrombin is shown in grayin the position that it occupies when thrombin and factor Xa are superposed. The 60F lysine residue can be seen snaking into the active site, occupying a similar position to the side chain Gln61in factor Xa. The figure was prepared using Molscript (48Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 shows a structure-based alignment of thrombin and fXa highlighting residues in the active site that differ between the two enzymes. Fig. 2 shows stereo views of the putative fXa-specific interactions between active site residues of fXa and the RCL of ATIII revealed by the model. Thrombin contains two major insertions with respect to fXa. The “149 loop” is located at the far end of the S1 specificity pocket and comprises a six-residue insertion with respect to fXa (Fig. 1). No additional interactions between this region and the modeled peptide in our fXa/RCL model were found when compared with the thrombin/RCL model. The other major insertion, the “60 loop” is replaced by a short α-helix in fXa (Fig. 2B). Comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of thrombin and fXa reveals that Lys60F protrudes into the active site in thrombin, whereas in fXa, Gln61 occupies an almost equivalent position in three-dimensional space (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, our modeling studies revealed that Gln61 is able to make a hydrogen bond to both the side chains of the P1′ Ser and the P3′ Asn, “bridging” these two residues (Fig. 2B). We predict that the Lys60F present in thrombin, even if optimally placed, would only be able to make one such interaction. Using the rotomer libraries available in Quanta, we also investigated whether Gln61 was capable of making interactions other than those described above. In an alternative conformation, the ɛ oxygen of the side chain of Gln61 could form a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of the peptide bond between P1′ and P2′. However, this interaction would only be predicted to result in one hydrogen bond. Again, the Lys60F residue present in thrombin would be unable to form such an interaction. These data suggest that Gln61 represents a major difference in the active site of fXa as compared with thrombin. We predicted that this residue may confer an enhanced ability to interact with the RCL of ATIII, and to test this prediction we generated the mutant, fXaQ61A. Our model revealed a putative salt bridge between Glu37 of fXa and the P6′ Arg (Fig. 2A). A two-residue insertion in thrombin maps to this region, and comparison of the structures revealed that no equivalent residue to Glu37 exists in thrombin. Furthermore, we noted that Glu39 of fXa, while not directly interacting with residues in the RCL of ATIII in our model, was only 6 Å from the P4′–P5′ peptide bond nitrogen, with which it could potentially interact. We therefore decided to test, via site-directed mutagenesis, whether either Glu37 or Glu39affected the interaction between fXa and H5-activated ATIII. The S side specificity pockets of both fXa and thrombin have been extensively characterized using both biochemical and structural studies. In our model, the P1–P3 residues made numerous contacts with the active site of fXa and thrombin that were conserved between both enzymes. In addition, the specificity of the S2 pocket of both thrombin and fXa has been characterized in some detail (31Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7437-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Pautler E. Zupan A. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

The model indicated that the P4 Ile nestled in a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by Tyr99, Trp215, and Phe174 (Fig.2A). In contrast, the x-ray crystal structure of thrombin revealed that substitution of Tyr99 with Leu and Phe174 with Ile resulted in a shallower and less well defined S4 pocket in this enzyme (17Brinen L.S.

Seven peptides with chain lengths of 10 (M2-10; FKYLLSNYSS), 14 (M2-14), 18 (M2-18), 22 (M2-22), 26 (M2-26), 30 (M2-30) and 35 (M2-35; RSRKTPIFIINQVSLFLIILHSALYFKYLLSNYSS) residues, respectively, were synthesized. CD spectra revealed that M2-10 was disordered, and all of the other peptides assumed partially α-helical secondary structures in 99% trifluoroethanol (TFE)/H2O. In 50% TFE/H2O, M2-30 assumed a β-like structure. The other six peptides exhibited the same CD patterns as those found in 99% TFE/H2O. In 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (4:1 ratio) vesicles, M2-22, M2-26, and M2-35 formed α-helical structures, whereas the other peptides formed β-like structures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (4:1) multilayers showed that M2-10, M2-14, M2-18, and M2-30 assumed β-structures in this environment. Another homologous 30-residue peptide (M2-30B), missing residues SNYSS from the N terminus and extending to RSRKT on the C terminus, was helical in lipid bilayers, suggesting that residues at the termini of transmembrane domains influence their biophysical properties. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that M2-22, M2-26, M2-30B, and M2-35 were α-helical and oriented at angles of 12°, 13°, 36°, and 34°, respectively, with respect to the multilayer normal. This study showed that chain length must be taken into consideration when using peptides representing single transmembrane domains as surrogates for regions of an intact receptor. Furthermore, this work indicates that the tilt angle and conformation of transmembrane portions of G protein-coupled receptors may be estimated by detailed spectroscopic measurements of single transmembrane peptides.

Furthermore, this work indicates that the tilt angle and conformation of transmembrane portions of G protein-coupled receptors may be estimated by detailed spectroscopic measurements of single transmembrane peptides. The folding and structure of integral membrane proteins is driven by entropic factors that cause the apolar side chains of many amino acid residues to seek the interior of lipid bilayers and enthalpic factors that require that the hydrogen bond potential of the peptide group be satisfied in the low dielectric membrane interior (1.Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic analyses indicate that the α-helix is the most favored conformation of membrane-spanning regions of proteins. Indeed, it is believed that preassembled α-helices form in the aqueous cytoplasm of the cell and then insert into the bilayer (2.Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 411-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The thickness of the hydrocarbon milieu of the bilayer depends on the fatty acid composition and is often assumed to be about 30 Å. On this basis, the minimum number of residues that can form an α-helix and span the bilayer is predicted to be 20. However, this prediction assumes that the peptide inserts into the membrane parallel to the bilayer normal. Recent x-ray studies on integral membrane proteins and in particular on rhodopsin show that not all of the transmembrane helices of this protein orient normal to the bilayer (3.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamota M. Miyano M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Thus, in some cases, more than 20 residues will be required to span the bilayer. Similar conclusions are reached upon inspection of other crystal structures (5.Pebay-Peyroula E. Rummel G. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 6.Kimura Y. Vassylyev D.G. Miyazawa A. Kidera A. Matsushima M. Mitsuoka K. Murata K. Hirai T. Fujiyoshi Y.

Biol. 1999; 286: 861-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the number of crystal structures for membrane proteins remains very small in comparison with the proportion of these molecules in cells (8.Garavito R.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 344-349Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9.Tsukihara T. Lee S.J. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1999; 6: 918-927Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Accordingly, many investigators are using peptide fragments as model compounds to examine the biophysical and structural tendencies of transmembrane regions of these proteins (10.Albert A.D. Yeagle P.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 107-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11.Deber C.M. Liu L.P. Wang C. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An unresolved question in these studies is the appropriate length of the model peptide and the influence of length on the ability of the peptide to assume a stable helix in bilayers. This question is important because amino acid residues in transmembrane regions of a protein are often those, such as Val, Ile, and Phe, that assume β-sheet structures in globular proteins (12.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). Although Deber and co-workers (13.Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14.Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the secondary structural preferences of amino acid residues are context-dependent and that these residues have high helix-forming tendencies in membrane mimetic solvents, this correlation was determined using peptides of a constant length. Studies with short peptides indicate that in solution β-sheet formation is maximum for peptides containing 8–12 residues (15.Pillai V.N. Rajasekharan V.N. Mutter M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1981; 14: 122-130Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have been conducting a detailed biophysical analysis on synthetic peptides corresponding to putative domains of the α-factor receptor of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This G protein-coupled receptor recognizes the tridecapeptide pheromone (WHWLQLKPGQPMY-α-factor) and triggers a cascade of intracellular events ultimately resulting in sexual conjugation and diploid formation (16.Dohlman H.G.

In the present communication, we focus on the second transmembrane domain of Ste2p. Peptides of various chain lengths corresponding to the sequence of this domain were synthesized (see Table I for the nomenclature used in this paper and the sequences of the peptide fragments) and examined using both CD spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy to determine their secondary structural preferences and orientation in lipid bilayers. The results provide insights into the influence of peptide chain length on both the propensity of these peptides to form helices in lipid bilayers and their helical orientation in multilayers.Table IHelicities (%) for fragments of the second Ste2p TMD in different membrane mimetic environmentsPeptidesSequencesTFE/H2O ratioDMPC/DMPG vesicles (4:1)99:150:50M2–10FKYLLSNYSS—1-a—, not calculated due to absence of double minima at 208 and 222 nm.——M2–14SALYFKYLLSNYSS4444—M2–18IILHSALYFKYLLSNYSS5255—M2–22SLFLIILHSALYFKYLLSNYSS677258M2–26INQVSLFLIILHSALYFKYLLSNYSS828561M2–30PIFIINQVSLFLIILHSALYFKYLLSNYSS83——M2–30BRSRKTPIFIINQVSLFLIILHSALYFKYLL886158M2–35RSRKTPIFIINQVSLFLIILHSALYFKYLLSNYSS8172921-a —, not calculated due to absence of double minima at 208 and 222 nm.

For the synthesis of all peptides except for M2-30B (Table I), the first Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH (20-fold excess) was loaded manually on a Wang resin (0.4 mmol of OH/g) using the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/4-N,N′-dimethylaminopyridine strategy in dichloromethane. Small amounts of unreacted OH groups on the Wang resin were capped using a 100-fold excess of acetic anhydride in the presence of 4-N,N′-dimethylaminopyridine. After the peptide chain was manually elongated to three amino acid residues (i.e. Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-Ser(tBu)-Ser(tBu)-Wang resin), the resin was loaded on a solid phase peptide synthesizer (model 433A; Applied Biosystems). The coupling strategy utilized FastMoc chemistry with the use of extended coupling times. Double coupling was carried out for each residue usingO-benzotriazolyl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole activation, and capping was accomplished with acetic anhydride in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. Approximately 15% of the resin was separated from the reaction vessel when the peptide chain length reached 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30 residues, respectively. Ultimately, the peptide was elongated to 35 residues. In this strategy, seven portions of resin with peptide chain lengths of 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, and 35 were obtained during one batch synthesis. The synthesis of M2-30B was carried out using a Wang resin (0.4 mmol of OH/g) where the first Fmoc-Leu-OH was loaded manually as described above. The resulting Fmoc-Leu-Wang resin was then transferred to the synthesizer, and chain assembly was completed. Each portion of resin was treated with a cleavage solution containing 0.38 g of phenol, 0.25 ml of thioanisole, 0.12 ml of 1,2-ethanedithiol, 0.25 ml of water, and 5 ml of trifluoroacetic acid. The cleavage reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to a small volume on a rotary evaporator at room temperature. The crude peptides were precipitated by the addition of anhydrous ether and collected by filtration. The crude peptides were lyophilized from TFE/H2O (1:4) before purification. Peptides were purified on a semipreparative μBondapak C18 HPLC column (19 × 300 mm) at room temperature with elution solvents of water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) plus acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at gradients from 10 to 80% acetonitrile over 90–120 min. All peptides were purified to over 98% homogeneity as judged by analytical reverse phase HPLC on a μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm) at room temperature with linear gradients of water (0.025% trifluoroacetic acid) plus acetonitrile (0.025% trifluoroacetic acid) or water (0.025% trifluoroacetic acid) plus methanol (0.025% trifluoroacetic acid). Detection was at 220 nm. The final products were assessed by electrospray mass spectrometry to verify correct intact molecular weight and sequence. Peptides were dissolved in acetonitrile/H2O/acetic acid (50:50:1) at ∼5 pmol/μl. The solution was directly infused at a flow rate of 5.0 μl/min into an electrospray ion trap (LCQ-DECA Thermo Finnigan) operating in the positive ionization mode. All peptides were found to be within 0.5 daltons of the expected mass. The correct sequence order was confirmed by collision-induced dissociation (MS/MS) on the M2-35 peptide. Since all peptides except for M2-30B were synthesized on the same template, portions of the sequence of the M2-35 peptide are replicated in each of the shorter peptides. The +3 and the +4 charge state of the M2-35 peptide were individually isolated and fragmented. The resultant product ions were compared with the theoretical ions from the M2-35 peptide. Fragment ions corresponding to 26 of the 35 amino acids were identified. Furthermore, all ions above the background could be attributed to the M2-35 sequence. No diagnostic product ions were observed from the first 8 amino acids from the N terminus or the last two from the C terminus. The last two amino acids on the C terminus are both serine residues, so the order is equivalent, and the presence of two serines was confirmed by an agreement between calculated and measured values for the predicted fragment ion from the third residue from the C terminus. The sequence of the 8 amino acids of the N terminus was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The longest peptide with 35 residues had previously been confirmed by amino acid analysis (19.Xie H. Ding F.-X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.-F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The peptide synthesized in this study was identical with the authentic sample as judged by co-injection on analytical HPLC. Thus, the sequences of all peptides examined in this investigation have been proven. Peptides corresponding to the second Ste2p TMD (0.17–0.57 mg in 0.10 ml of TFE/H2O (10:1)) were added to 4 mg of DMPC/DMPG (4:1) in 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (4:1). The resulting solution was dried under N2 flow. Residual traces of organic solvent were removed by placing the dried film under vacuum overnight, and the lipid was then resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. The suspension was sonicated at ∼50 °C for 60 min in a W-385 sonicator (Misonix, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) equipped with a cup horn (40% output power). The vesicle preparation was exhaustively dialyzed three times into 600 ml of 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, using Spectrapor 6 dialysis tubing with a 1000 molecular weight cut-off (VWR Scientific Products). The resulting vesicles were then passed through a 0.45-μm polycarbonate centrifugal filter. The calculated molar ratio of peptides to lipid was about 1:50. The final peptide concentrations ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 mm. The CD spectra of the peptides were recorded on an AVIV model 62 DS CD instrument (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ), which was interfaced with a computer used for all mathematical calculations. Two cuvettes with light path lengths of 0.02 and 0.1 cm were used for vesicle suspensions and TFE/H2O solutions, respectively. All spectra were the average of five scans between 300 and 190 nm at an interval of 1 nm with a 1-s integration time at each wavelength. The bandwidth for each measurement was 1 nm. Peptide concentrations in solution and vesicle suspension were determined from UV absorbance using an extinction coefficient of 1340 cm−1m−1 for a single tyrosine residue at 280 nm (23.Carpenter K.A. Schmidt R. Yue S.Y. Hodzic L. Pou C. Payza K. Godbout C. Brown W. Roberts E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15295-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Prior to calculation of the final ellipticity, all spectra were corrected by subtracting the reference spectra of TFE/H2O at the ratio of 99:1 or 50:50 or of a DMPC/DMPG (4:1) vesicle suspension in 0.1 mmphosphate buffer (pH 6.3) without peptides. CD intensities are expressed as mean residue ellipticities (degrees · cm2/dmol). Estimation of α-helical percentages was made using a method initially suggested by Greenfield and Fasman (24.Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar) and later modified by Wu et al.(25.Wu C.S.C. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and Chen et al. (26.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). These methods use ellipticities at either 208 or 222 nm and calculate fractional helicities as follows,fh=([θ]−[θ] 0)/([θ] 100−[θ] 0)Equation 1 where [θ] represents the experimentally observed mean residue ellipticity; values for [θ]0 and [θ]100 corresponding to 0 and 100% helical content at 222 nm were estimated to be 2000 and 30,000 degrees·cm2/dmol, respectively (25.Wu C.S.C. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 26.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). FTIR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature (∼20 °C) on a Nicolet Magna 550 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet Analytical Instruments, Madison, WI) purged with N2 and equipped with a DTGS detector and an ATR accessory (Pike Technologies, Inc., Madison, WI). The infrared beam was polarized using a 1-inch diameter wire grid ZnSe polarizer. For each sample, 1000 interferograms were averaged at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 and processed using one-point zero filling and Happ-Genzel apodization. For orientation studies, lipid films on the top surface of germanium ATR crystals (55 × 10 × 4 mm with 45° beveled edges) were obtained by slowly evaporating the vesicle suspension (250 μl) in the presence or absence of peptides. The ATR crystals were previously cleaned with chloroform, TFE, and methanol, followed by 30-min plasma cleaning in a PDC-32G cleaner (Harrick, Ossining, NY). For transmission spectra, 100 μl of sample was dried on a CaF2 window (25-mm diameter). Following deposition, the ATR crystals or CaF2 windows were transferred to a desiccator, where the films were rehydrated by vapor diffusion in an atmosphere maintained at 98% relative humidity using a saturated solution of K2SO4 in water (27.Hunt J.F. Rath P. Rothschild K.J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15177-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rehydration was allowed to proceed for a minimum of 18 h at room temperature. The spectrum for the respective phospholipid multilayers without peptide was subtracted to yield the difference spectrum of each peptide in the multilayer. 100 μl of the preformed lipid vesicle with or without peptide was dried on the surface of the CaF2 window (25-mm diameter). The windows containing lipid films were rehydrated using the method described above. After recording FTIR spectra from the hydrated film, it was transferred to a dry box (i.e. an environment maintained at less than 10% relative humidity using P2O5), where it was dehydrated by storage at room temperature overnight. After recording FTIR spectra from the dry film in order to confirm dehydration, 8 μl of D2O was added directly to its surface. The sample was tilted until the water had wet the entire surface of the film and then incubated in the dry environment for 30 min in order to allow most of the excess D2O to evaporate. Whereas some of bulk D2O was still visible on the surface of the film, it was transferred to a sealed chamber maintained at a relative humidity of 98% (in D2O) by a saturated solution of K2SO4 in D2O. The amide exchange was allowed to proceed for 18 h. After all of the bulk D2O had evaporated from the surface of the film, FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded in a N2environment. Order parameters for the helical peptides were determined using established methods (28.Arkin I.T. Russ W.P. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29.Smith S.O. Jonas R. Braiman M. Bormann B.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30.Tamm L.K. Talulian S.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7720-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The measured dichroic ratio,R ATR, defined as the ratio between the absorption of light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the surface of the internal reflection element, was used to calculate an order parameter (S) using Equation 2, S=(Ex2−RATREy2+Ez2)(Ex2−RATREy2−Ez2)÷(3cos2α−1)2Equation 2 in which E x, E y, andE z are the integrated absorption coefficients (31.Harrick N.J. Internal Reflection Spectroscopy. Interscience Publisher, New York1967Google Scholar). If the film refractive index is independent of the wavelength, Equation2 can be written in a simplified form (Equation 3) by settingE x = 1.398, E y = 1.516, andE z = 1.625 (32.Menikh A. Saleh M.T. Gariepy J. Boggs J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15865-15872Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar),S=(RATR−2)(RATR+1.45)/(3cos2α−1)2Equation 3 in which α represents the angle between the principal transition dipole moment and the molecular director; α = 39° for the amide I mode (28.Arkin I.T. Russ W.P. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7233-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The order parameter S is related to the tilt angle β from the normal of the internal reflection element by Equation 4.S=(3cos2β−1)2Equation 4 Order parameters for the lipids are obtained from the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of the lipid methylene groups by setting α = 90°. A peptide representing the second transmembrane domain of Ste2p was designed to have the sequence RSRKTPIFIINQVSLFLIILHSALYFKYLLSNYSS that extends from Arg74 to Ser108 of the receptor. This peptide includes the entire transmembrane hydrophobic region plus 6 extracellular and 5 cytoplasmic residues (19.Xie H. Ding F.-X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.-F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The complete peptide with the wild-type sequence was synthesized previously and found to form a highly α-helical secondary structure in aqueous TFE, SDS micelles, DMPC vesicles, and multilayers (19.Xie H. Ding F.-X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.-F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20.Ding F.-X. Xie H. Arshava B. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8945-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the above region of Ste2p was chosen to study the effect of chain length on the secondary structures assumed by membrane peptides. We synthesized seven peptide fragments with 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, and 35 residues, respectively, starting from the carboxyl-terminal serine (Ser108). These peptide fragments were named M2-10, M2-14, M2-18, M2-22, M2-26, M2-30, and M2-35, respectively, in which M2 represents the second transmembrane domain and the number following M2- represents the chain length of these peptide fragments (19.Xie H. Ding F.-X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.-F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The peptides were prepared using solid-phase peptide chemistry. To examine the influence of loop residues on the biophysical properties of the second transmembrane domain, one peptide lacking SNYSS (M2-30B) was also synthesized. Membrane peptides usually contain regions that are predominantly hydrophobic, and peptide chains that are assembled on a resin matrix can aggregate either with other peptide chains or with the polymer support. Therefore, low loading substitution of the resin (less than 0.4 mmol/g) was selected for this synthesis. Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-Ser(tBu)-Wang resin was not stable during the standard deprotection in the presence of 20% piperdine/N,N-dimethylformamide, possibly due to diketopiperazine formation upon Fmoc removal. It was determined that using 10% piperidine/N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml for 0.1-mmol scale of resin) for 10 min to deprotect Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-Ser(tBu)-Wang resin followed by immediate reaction with the next amino acid residue minimized the loss of peptide chains. Completion of the deprotection and subsequent coupling reaction were carefully monitored by UV absorbance of the dibenzofulvene-piperidine adduct. The shape and intensity of a CD spectrum between 180 and 240 nm are sensitive to protein secondary structure. As the Ste2p receptor protein is localized to the plasma membrane inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, all of the fragments were analyzed using CD spectroscopy in membrane mimetic media including aqueous TFE and DMPC/DMPG (4:1) vesicles. Qualitative analysis of the α-helicity of a peptide by CD spectroscopy is based on the discernment of characteristic peak shapes. In particular, double minima at 222 and 208 nm and a ratio of the magnitudes of the molar ellipticities at 195 and 222 nm greater than or equal to 2.5:1 are indicative of α-helical structures (33.Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), whereas a single minimum at 217 nm and a maximum at 197 nm are indicative of β-structures (34.Pysh E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35.Woody R.W. Biopolymers. 1969; 8: 669-683Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 36.Madison V. Schellman J. Biopolymers. 1972; 11: 1041-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of these CD spectra was carried out using the ellipticity at 222 nm to approximate percent α-helicities as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Estimated α-helicities are listed in Table I. It should be noted that calculations based on the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm are not"

We demonstrated previously that mutations of the hapten contact residue HTrp-100 to Arg (where H refers to the heavy chain) resulted in increased specificity for digoxin analogs substituted at the cardenolide 16 position. However, mutagenesis of H:CDR1 did not result in such a specificity change despite the proximity of the H:CDR1 hapten contact residue Asn-35 to the cardenolide 16 position. Here we constructed a bacteriophage-displayed library containing randomized mutations at H chain residues 30–35 in a 26–10 mutant containing Arg-100 (26–10-RRALD). Phage were selected by panning against digoxin, gitoxin (16-OH), and 16-acetylgitoxin coupled to bovine serum albumin. Clones that retained wild-type Asn at position 35 showed preferred binding to gitoxin, like the 26–10-RRALD parent. In contrast, clones containing Val-35 selected mainly on digoxin-bovine serum albumin demonstrated a shift back to wild-type specificity. Several clones containing Val-35 bound digoxin with increased affinity, approaching that of the wild type in a few instances, in contrast to the mutation Val-35 in the wild-type 26–10 background, which reduces affinity for digoxin 90-fold. It has therefore proven possible to reorder the 26–10 binding site by mutations including two major contact residues on opposite sides of the site and yet to retain high affinity for binding for digoxin. Thus, even among antibodies that have undergone affinity maturation in vivo, different structural solutions to high affinity binding may be revealed.

Campbell R.L. Petsko G.A. Haber E. Margolies M.N. Sheriff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10310-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Quite different results were obtained, however, when residues 99–101 (Kabat numbering (8.Kabat E.A. Reed-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar)) of H:CDR3, located on the opposite side of the binding pocket to H:CDR1, were randomized (Fig. 2). When panned on 16-substituted congeners linked to BSA, a set of clones was selected with improved binding for the 16-substituted congeners with a concomitant decrease in affinity for digoxin. Sequence analyses of multiple mutants indicated that the mutation of tryptophan 100 to arginine was responsible for the specificity change, a result confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This result was unexpected as HTrp-100 lay on the side of digoxigenin opposite to the cardenolide C16 position (Fig. 2). HTrp-100 accounts for extensive contact with the cardenolide B, C, and D rings. We proposed that substitution of the wt Trp by Arg allowed the hapten to shift toward H:CDR3, thereby providing space for C16 substituents in the region of H:CDR1. In the present study, we planned to further explore possibilities for specificity modulation by looking for complementary or cooperative mutations on opposite sides of the binding site. An H:CDR3 mutant of 26–10, designated 26–10 RRALD (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), with an affinity of 1.9 × 109m−1 for digoxin demonstrated a shift in specificity toward C16 analogs of digoxin. This mutant was used as a template for randomization at H:CDR1 positions 30–35 inclusive. RRALD represents a mutant sequence at positions 99–101 (Kabat numbering (8.Kabat E.A. Reed-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar)). The corresponding wt 26–10 sequence is KWAMD. The phage-displayed library was panned against digoxin, gitoxin, and 16-acetylgitoxin, each coupled to BSA. Analysis of the sequences, binding specificity, and affinity of selected clones indicated that the mutation H:N35V 3Mutants are denoted by the position number, preceded by the wt or parental residue and followed by the mutated residue.3Mutants are denoted by the position number, preceded by the wt or parental residue and followed by the mutated residue. in H:CDR1 resulted in shifting the specificity back to wt. An unexpected observation was that certain Val-35-containing mutants also restored affinity for digoxin in the range of the wt 26–10. Thus, it proved possible to engineer in vitro an antibody with wt-like specificity and high affinity that contained mutations at two major contact residues, each of which when introduced independently lowered affinity for digoxin, thus revealing unexpected plasticity of the 26–10 combining site. This observation is in contradistinction to antibodies obtained following affinity maturation in vivo, where the central and contact residues of the combining site are generally conserved and little possibility of further structural differentiation was expected. Nucleotide sequences encoding the 26–10 Fab, from H chain position Glu-H1 to Arg-H228 (Kabat numbering (8.Kabat E.A. Reed-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S.

Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 26–10 Fab was detected on the surface of bacteriophage M13 as a fusion protein with M13 protein 3. Excision of the gene 3 portion resulted in secretion of soluble 26–10 Fab into the culture supernatant (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as described (10.Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Lerner R.A. Burton D.R. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 119-124Google Scholar). Vector pComb3–26-10-RRALD was selected from a phage-displayed 26–10 library randomized at amino acids 99–101 in H:CDR3 (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This clone produced Fab with lower affinity for digoxin (K a = 1.5 × 109m−1) relative to 26–10 wt but increased specificity for 16-substituted congeners. We used this as a template to introduce a cassette containing randomized residues at positions H30–35 inclusive (H:CDR1). DNA from the randomized H:CDR1 library (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was cut with AccI and AatII, and DNA from the pComb3–26-10 RRALD vector was cut with the same enzymes. The 1413-bp RRALD fragment was gel-purified and ligated as described previously (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting H:CDR1/RRALD library was introduced by electroporation into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue F′ cells. Infection of the XL1-Blue library with VCSM13 helper phage (XL1-Blue F′ and VCSM13 are from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) generated a library of phage with surface Fab containing six substituted positions in H:CDR1. Phage were recovered and concentrated by polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation from bacterial supernatants (10.Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Lerner R.A. Burton D.R. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 119-124Google Scholar). Bacteriophage yield was quantitated by counting of ampicillin-resistant E. colicolonies on agar plates. The site-directed mutant 26–10 N35V was constructed as follows: an oligonucleotide complementary to positions 382–426 of the pComb3 vector, containing an MfeI restriction site, and a reverse primer complementary to positions 489–512, containing the mutation N35V, were used to make a PCR fragment containing the sequence encoding Val-35 at the 3′ end. This PCR fragment was then used as a forward primer to obtain a larger PCR fragment with a BamHI sequence at its 3′ end. The reverse primer was complementary to positions 876–897 and contained the BamHI sequence. This 515-bp PCR fragment was cut withMfeI and BamHI, and the resultant 480-bpMfeI/BamHI fragment was cloned into the pComb3–26-10-RRALD vector. The double mutant 26–10 H:N35V/W100R was made by ligating two DNA fragments: a 2611-bpAccI/AatII fragment of the vector pComb3–26-10-RRALD containing the mutation H:N35V described above, ligated with a 1413-bp AccI/AatII fragment of pComb3–26-10-W100R. The construction of the pComb3–26-10-W100R mutant was described previously (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The presence of the two mutations N35V and W100R in the final construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Enrichment of the bacteriophage expressing specifically bound Fab mutants was achieved by successive rounds of binding to cardiac glycoside-BSA-coated microtiter wells (Costar 3690, Cambridge, MA) followed by washing, elution, re-infection, and growth according to the procedure of Barbas and Lerner (10.Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Lerner R.A. Burton D.R. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 119-124Google Scholar). Cardiac glycoside-BSA coupling was described previously (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phage from each panning round was grown in E. coli without the VCSM13 helper, and phagemid DNA was isolated from a 50-ml culture using a Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). An aliquot was sequenced to estimate the minimum complexity of the sequences in the mutated H:CDR1 region. Phage were analyzed after four successive rounds of biopanning. A 1-μg sample of pooled phagemid DNA from the final panning round was cut with NheI and SpeI and re-ligated to remove gene 3 (10.Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Lerner R.A. Burton D.R. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 2. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 119-124Google Scholar). After re-ligation, the DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue cells and plated on Luria-Bertani medium/carbenicillin plates. Bacterial colonies were isolated and screened for Fab production and antigen binding by ELISA. The DNA sequences of cardiac glycoside ELISA-positive clones were determined using the dideoxy sequencing method. Fab was produced as described previously (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bacterial supernatants were tested in a direct binding ELISA in 96-well microtiter plates coated with BSA alone, cardiac glycoside-BSA, or goat anti-mouse Fab antibody (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells were coated with antigen and blocked with 3% BSA in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, 0.15m NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide. Bacterial supernatant was added and incubated for 3 h at room temperature and detected after a 2-h room temperature incubation with peroxidase-labeled F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM using the TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and neutralization with 1.0m phosphoric acid. Color development was measured at 450 nm in a Bio-Tek ELISA reader. Affinities for digoxin were measured on dilute bacterial supernatants using a saturation equilibrium assay (5.Short M.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by using filtration through glass fiber filters to separate bound and free [3H]digoxin (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA). Each tube contained a constant amount of Fab, one of twelve serial dilutions of [3H]digoxin (1.1 × 10−7m to 3.0 × 10−11m), depending on preliminary screening, and 0.5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse Fab antibody. The goat anti-mouse Fab antibody was necessary to efficiently retain the anti-digoxin Fab on the filter (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis was used to determine affinities. The specificity (relative affinity) of Fab for different cardiac glycosides was determined using a competition ELISA assay, described previously (7.Krykbaev R.A. Liu W.R. Jeffrey P.D. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8149-8158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Wells of microtiter plates were coated with either digoxin-BSA, gitoxin-BSA, or 16-acetylgitoxin-BSA and contained a constant amount of Fab and serial dilutions of cardiac glycosides. Each mutant Fab was tested on ELISA with the 16-substituted congeners and digoxin as competitors.

Open table in a new tab Previously, by panning from a randomized 5-mer H:CDR3 library (positions 99–101) displayed on bacteriophage, we selected mutants of the anti-digoxin Fab 26–10, which preferentially bound to analogs of digoxin substituted at the C16 position of the cardenolide (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The shift in specificity proved to be attributable to the substitution of Arg for Trp at position 100. The mutant 26–10-RRALD (residues 99–101) was chosen as a parent clone for construction of a randomized H:CDR1 library (residues 30–35 inclusive) (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to examine the effects on affinity and specificity in the presence of mutations on the opposite side of the combining site. The original H:CDR1 library (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) contained 107 clones and represents the maximum diversity in the H:CDR1-RRALD library constructed here. (Because this is a second generation library made from the first Maxi-Prep of the H:CDR1 library and an insert containing H:CDR3 RRALD, it is not possible to determine the library size by counting colonies.) The library was panned four times on digoxin-BSA, and two congeners of digoxin substituted at C16: gitoxin (16-OH) and 16-acetylgitoxin coupled to BSA. Secreted Fab were tested for binding to digoxin-BSA and goat anti-mouse Fab antibody. More than 90% of clones selected after four rounds of panning for each cardiac glycoside bound digoxin in an ELISA. Twenty-five digoxin-binding clones were selected from pannings on each of the three cardiac glycosides. DNA sequence analyses of 21 clones from panning on digoxin-BSA, 20 from gitoxin-BSA, and 22 from 16-acetylgitoxin-BSA are shown in Table I. Several sequences were observed more than once. Sixteen unique sequences were found following panning on digoxin-BSA, 18 for gitoxin-BSA, and 17 for 16-acetylgitoxin-BSA. The affinities (K a) for digoxin were measured for most clones (Table I), revealing a range of ≤ 0.2 to 10.5 × 109m−1. The average affinity 4The lower limits of measurement in the affinity assay are ≤ 5 × 106m−1 (4.Schildbach J.F. Panka D.J. Parks D.R. Jager G.C. Novotny J. Herzenberg L.A. Mudgett-Hunter M. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4640-4647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculations of average affinity assume, for these digoxin-binding clones, K a = 0.01 × 109m−1. for clones selected using digoxin-BSA was 4.5 × 109m−1 (including duplicates), 1.06 × 109m−1 for gitoxin-BSA-selected clones, and 1.54 × 109m−1for 16-acetylgitoxin-BSA-selected clones. By comparison, the affinity of wt 26–10 in parallel assays was 13 × 109m−1, and the affinity of the parental mutant 26–10-RRALD was 1.9 × 109m−1. Specificities of mutant Fabs for the three analogs were determined using competition ELISA for representative clones. In general, two different specificity patterns were found in all groups selected by all three analogs: one similar to the parent RRALD mutant (increased relative affinity for 16-substituted analogs) and the other resembling that of the wt 26–10 specificity, where digoxin is bound to a greater extent than 16-substituted analogs. There was an absolute correlation between the presence of a Val residue at position 35 and wt-like specificity (Table I); in addition, Asn at position 35 was always associated with heteroclitic binding to gitoxin, similar to the parent mutant 26–10-RRALD. Among 16 clones, each with a unique sequence selected on digoxin-BSA, all but one expressed Val at position 35. As noted above, digoxin-BSA-selected clones exhibited significantly higher affinity for digoxin and wt-like specificity associated with the presence of HVal-35. Among 18 gitoxin-BSA-selected clones, eight expressed valine, and for the larger analog 16-acetylgitoxin, one of 17 clones expressed Val at position 35. Asn-35, the wt 26–10 residue, was not observed among digoxin-BSA-selected clones but was present frequently in clones selected by the other congeners, as was Ser-35. To test the effect of the mutation N35V independently of other H:CDR1 residue mutations, we constructed by site-directed mutagenesis the mutant 26–10-RRALD-N35V (Table I). This single mutation resulted in a 3-fold increase in affinity for digoxin relative to 26–10-RRALD, associated with reversion to the wt-like specificity (Table I). We also constructed a double mutant, H:N35V/W100R, on the wt background. The affinity of this mutant Fab for digoxin was 3-fold lower than that of 26–10-RRALD. The affinity of the mutant 26–10-KRAMD constructed previously (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and that of 26–10-RRALD are approximately the same. Thus, the mutation N35V has opposite effects upon affinity when combined with the sequences KRAMD versus RRALD at positions 99–101. Accordingly, the effects on the affinity of double mutations at the contact residues at positions 35/100 depend on the context of other mutations in H:CDR3. Residues other than H35 in CDR1 also modulate affinity as only certain RRALD mutants with Val-35 have improved affinity (Table I). However, the specificity of the 26–10 H:N35V/W100R mutant is reverted to wt-like specificity as inall selected clones (Table I) and other site-directed mutants, indicating a consistent correlation of specificity with the identity of the residue at H35. Amino acid substitutions at positions H30–32 were diverse (Table I). At position 33, where Tyr is a hapten contact residue in the crystal structure of the Fab 26–10:digoxin complex (3.Jeffrey P.D. Strong R.K. Sieker L.C. Chang C.Y. Campbell R.L. Petsko G.A. Haber E. Margolies M.N. Sheriff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10310-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), an aromatic residue was present in 35 of 51 clones. At position 34, which points into the hydrophobic core of VH, only the aliphatic residues Ile, Leu, Val, and the aromatic Tyr and Phe were observed. The distribution of amino acid substitutions at residues 30–34 in the experiment reported here using a 26–10-RRALD parent was very similar to that determined previously in experiments using the wt 26–10 as the parental clone for H:CDR1 mutagenesis (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The conservation of these residues is in accordance with the hypothesis that the general binding site motif is maintained in the mutants expressing non-wt residues at the nominal contact residues H35 and H100. However, in the wt background, HAsn-35 is nearly always selected (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in contrast to HVal-35 when the parental clone is 26–10-RRALD. The 26–10 mutant with sequence RRALD at positions 99–101 in H:CDR3, obtained previously by selection from a phage-displayed library (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), has an affinity for digoxin of 1.9 × 109m−1 as compared with the wt affinity of 13 × 109m−1. The wt sequence in this region is KWAMD. Extensive consensus sequences indicated that the mutation H:W100R was responsible for improvement in specificity for 16-conjugated digoxin analogs associated with a decrease in affinity for digoxin. A site-directed mutant, 26–10-W100R, resulted in a 6- to 7-fold decrease in affinity for digoxin (6.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Demirjian A. Margolies M.N. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), associated with increase in relative binding to C16-substituted digoxin analogs. In the work reported here, substitution of Val-35 for the wt Asn in H:CDR1 on the background of 26–10 RRALD restored digoxin binding and 26–10-like specificity in several clones (Table I), apparently also dependent on the context of other residues in H:CDR1. Among 14 clones with affinities for digoxin higher than that for the parent clone 26–10-RRALD, eight were selected by digoxin. All retained the wt HTyr-33 or the aromatic substitutions Trp or Phe. HTyr-33 is a contact residue to digoxin in the wt 26–10 Fab:digoxin complex (Fig. 2). The preponderance of Tyr at H33, as well as the strong preponderance of aliphatic Leu, Val, Ile, and aromatic residues at position 34, which points into the hydrophobic core of VHin the wt structure, suggest that the local conformation of H:CDR1 is conserved to a considerable degree in the mutant clones containing Arg-100 and substitutions for wt HAsn-35, particularly Val. A similar set of consensus amino acids was observed (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) at positions 33 and 34 in randomized H:CDR1 libraries using, as template, the wt 26–10 in which the wt residue at position 100 is Trp. We also showed previously that wide variations in amino acid side chains were permissible at residues 30–32 of the H:CDR1 loop in the wt 26–10. To test the proposal that the substitution of Val at position 35 in 26–10 RRALD is responsible for increasing digoxin binding and reversion to wt specificity, we constructed the mutant 26–10 RRALD N35V. This mutant demonstrated a 3-fold increase in digoxin binding and a reversion to wt specificity (Table I). However, the same mutation (N35V) in the wt background reduces digoxin binding more than 90-fold (11.Schildbach J.F. Shaw S.Y. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Herzenberg L.A. Jager G.C. Jeffrey P.D. Panka D.J. Parks D.R. Near R.I. Novotny J. Sheriff S. Margolies M.N. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This last result is consistent with previous analyses of digoxin-BSA-selected mutants from an H:CDR1 library of wt 26–10 (5.Short M.K. Jeffrey P.D. Kwong R.F. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28541-28550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), where virtually all digoxin-binding clones retain the wt Asn at H35 and specificity shifts were not observed. Thus, combined non-conservative mutations at two contact residues, H35 and H100, each of which separately results in a significant decrease in affinity for digoxin, taken together restore digoxin affinity in some instances (e.g. clone D17) nearly to wt 26–10 levels. This result is particularly unexpected as each of the two residues in the wt accounts for significant interactions with hapten. HTrp-100 makes extensive van der Waals contact with residues from the B, C, and D rings of digoxin. On the other side of the binding pocket, there is tight complementarity between HAsn-35 and the C16 position of the cardenolide (3.Jeffrey P.D. Strong R.K. Sieker L.C. Chang C.Y. Campbell R.L. Petsko G.A. Haber E. Margolies M.N. Sheriff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10310-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HAsn-35 forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyls of HSer-95 and HTyr-47, two other hapten contact residues. Mutagenesis limited to position H35 resulted in decreased affinity for digoxin (11.Schildbach J.F. Shaw S.Y. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Herzenberg L.A. Jager G.C. Jeffrey P.D. Panka D.J. Parks D.R. Near R.I. Novotny J. Sheriff S. Margolies M.N. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Bulkier substituents ablated binding, consistent with tight complementarity between HAsn-35 and the cardenolide. HAsn-35 is involved in hydrogen bonding to other residues in a majority of Fab crystal structures (summarized by Padlan (12.Padlan E.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)) and is thought to thereby stabilize the binding site in many antibodies. Although this may be the case in the wt 26–10, where the H:N35V substitution is deleterious, in the reordered combining site of the 26–10 mutants described here, containing Val-35 and Arg-100, this hydrogen bond network is not critical to effect high affinity digoxin binding. We had assumed that these bonds resulted in partial compensation to HSer-95 and HTyr-47 for the lack of solvent and the general hydrophobic environment when digoxin is bound. The preponderance of Val at H35 among selected mutants and the increased affinity of the mutant N35V would argue, however, that the absence of these hydrogen bonds is not as deleterious as expected (11.Schildbach J.F. Shaw S.Y. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Herzenberg L.A. Jager G.C. Jeffrey P.D. Panka D.J. Parks D.R. Near R.I. Novotny J. Sheriff S. Margolies M.N. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We reported previously cooperativity between two hapten contact residues to increase the affinity for a cardiac glycoside analog (7.Krykbaev R.A. Liu W.R. Jeffrey P.D. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8149-8158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) for Fab 26–10 in which a 26–10 phage-displayed mutant containing the mutation W100R was further mutagenized in the H:CDR3 region at positions 94–98 and mutant phage selected on 16-substituted digoxin analogs. A set of mutants was recruited with further increase in specificity for 16-substituted haptens due to the additional contact residue mutation H:S95G. These mutants bound gitoxin (16-OH) with affinities up to 150-fold greater than that of the wt 26–10 for digoxin. Cooperativity between contact residues was also reported previously for the germline-encoded Ab McPC603 (13.Glockshüber R. Stadlmüller J. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3049-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The finding that two contact residue mutations in a high affinity Ab obtained in a secondary immune response provide an alternative mode for high affinity hapten binding has not, to our knowledge, been observed during affinity maturation in vivo, where in general mutations that enhance affinity occur in non-contact amino acids or even amino acids distant from the site (14.Hawkins R.E.

Mutagenesis studies of contact residues of Abs where the structure has been determined crystallographically indicate that mutations of contact residues most often result in a significant decrease in affinity for antigen (although a few contact residues may be energetically unimportant) (11.Schildbach J.F.

Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14095-14103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as affinity maturation in vivoinvolves stepwise selection and expansion of mutant B cell clones with resultant enhanced affinity, mutations such as 26–10-H:W100R or 26–10-H:N35V would be unlikely to be selected in vivo, although there are rare examples of recruitment of low affinity clones (24.Manser T. Parhami-Seren B. Margolies M.N. Gefter M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Engineering of Abs in vitro, however, allows sets of cooperative mutations to be revealed irrespective of the individual contributions of each residue and independent of the temporal order of mutations. For 26–10, comparison of the unliganded Fab and the ligand-bound Fab demonstrates superimposition of structure without evidence for induced fit. Nonetheless, despite our previous assumption that 26–10 would have limited plasticity following differentiation during the secondary immune response, resulting in high affinity, it is possible to produce mutants in vitro with alternative contact residues that satisfy the requirements of high affinity binding to digoxin. Whether this unexpected diversity is related to a binding site mode dependent on pure hydrophobic interactions, with exclusion of water, or whether it may occur in other binding sites involving additional types of interactions or those differing in shape is not known. Affinity maturation in vivo proceeds via a selection mechanism that strongly favors single-point somatic mutations that are either neutral or produce enhanced antigen affinity, whereas mutations that reduce affinity are disfavored. If this is the case, then the selection of two mutations that individually reduce affinity but together show increased affinity may be a rare event in vivo. The final end product of antibody maturation may be as much a product of the path of mutation from germline to secondary antibody as a true optimization of antibody-antigen interactions. In the course of antigen-driven selection in vivo, alternative contact residues resulting in higher affinity binding have not been observed. The findings reported here, in which mutations of two contact residues distant from each other result in the formation of a binding site that is functionally equivalent to the wt, indicate that even high affinity secondary-response Abs may exhibit greater structural combining site differentiative capacity during the course of mutagenesis ex vivo than expected.

https://openalex.org/W1987935298,"Cancer is a multi-step, multi-genetic event. Whether oncogenic mutations cooperate with one another to transform cells and how is not well understood. The Friend murine retroviral erythroleukemia model involves mitogenic activation of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) by the virus env gene (F-gp55), aberrant over-expression of the transcription factor PU.1, and inactivating mutations in p53. In this report we demonstrate that concurrent expression of F-gp55 and PU.1 in erythroid target cells, in vivo, cooperate to accelerate erythroleukemia induction. Early in the disease, prior to the detection of clonal leukemic cells, activation of the EpoR by F-gp55, but not erythropoietin, resulted in transcriptional upregulation of PU.1 through a trans regulatory mechanism. This could occur in the absence of an integrated provirus within the PU.1 gene locus. The regulation of PU.1 transcription in established erythroleukemia cell lines differed depending upon the level of PU.1 protein present. Our results suggest that the action of F-gp55 contributes to both early and late stages of Friend erythroleukemia and that persistence of F-gp55 expression may be required not only to initiate erythroleukemia but to also maintain erythroleukemia following Friend virus infection."
