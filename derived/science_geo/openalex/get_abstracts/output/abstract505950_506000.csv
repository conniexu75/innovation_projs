https://openalex.org/W2165933771,"Cichlid fishes are famous for large, diverse and replicated adaptive radiations in the Great Lakes of East Africa. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cichlid phenotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of five lineages of African cichlids: the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an ancestral lineage with low diversity; and four members of the East African lineage: Neolamprologus brichardi/pulcher (older radiation, Lake Tanganyika), Metriaclima zebra (recent radiation, Lake Malawi), Pundamilia nyererei (very recent radiation, Lake Victoria), and Astatotilapia burtoni (riverine species around Lake Tanganyika). We found an excess of gene duplications in the East African lineage compared to tilapia and other teleosts, an abundance of non-coding element divergence, accelerated coding sequence evolution, expression divergence associated with transposable element insertions, and regulation by novel microRNAs. In addition, we analysed sequence data from sixty individuals representing six closely related species from Lake Victoria, and show genome-wide diversifying selection on coding and regulatory variants, some of which were recruited from ancient polymorphisms. We conclude that a number of molecular mechanisms shaped East African cichlid genomes, and that amassing of standing variation during periods of relaxed purifying selection may have been important in facilitating subsequent evolutionary diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2087474788,"Microbial community responses in soils from the Arctic to the Amazon often enhance the longer-term temperature sensitivity of respiration, particularly in soils with high carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and in soils from cold regions, suggesting that carbon stored in Arctic and boreal soils could be more vulnerable to climate warming than currently predicted. Much of the large amount of carbon stored in soils is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide through soil microbial respiration. It is thought that a warming induced stimulation of soil microbial respiration rates could increase soil carbon dioxide emissions and hence induce a positive climate feedback effect, but the response of soil microbial communities to changing temperatures remains uncertain. This paper investigates the role of microbial community level responses in controlling the temperature sensitivity of respiration in soils from the Arctic to the Amazon. The authors find that the microbial community level response enhances the longer-term temperature sensitivity of respiration more often than it reduces it. The strongest enhancing responses are observed in soils with high carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and in soils from cold climatic regions, suggesting that the substantial carbon stores in Arctic and boreal soils could be more vulnerable to climate warming than currently predicted. Soils store about four times as much carbon as plant biomass1, and soil microbial respiration releases about 60 petagrams of carbon per year to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide2. Short-term experiments have shown that soil microbial respiration increases exponentially with temperature3. This information has been incorporated into soil carbon and Earth-system models, which suggest that warming-induced increases in carbon dioxide release from soils represent an important positive feedback loop that could influence twenty-first-century climate change4. The magnitude of this feedback remains uncertain, however, not least because the response of soil microbial communities to changing temperatures has the potential to either decrease5,6,7 or increase8,9 warming-induced carbon losses substantially. Here we collect soils from different ecosystems along a climate gradient from the Arctic to the Amazon and investigate how microbial community-level responses control the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. We find that the microbial community-level response more often enhances than reduces the mid- to long-term (90 days) temperature sensitivity of respiration. Furthermore, the strongest enhancing responses were observed in soils with high carbon-to-nitrogen ratios and in soils from cold climatic regions. After 90 days, microbial community responses increased the temperature sensitivity of respiration in high-latitude soils by a factor of 1.4 compared to the instantaneous temperature response. This suggests that the substantial carbon stores in Arctic and boreal soils could be more vulnerable to climate warming than currently predicted."
https://openalex.org/W1998683102,"The isolation of human monoclonal antibodies is providing important insights into the specificities that underlie broad neutralization of HIV-1 (reviewed in ref. 1). Here we report a broad and extremely potent HIV-specific monoclonal antibody, termed 35O22, which binds a novel HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) epitope. 35O22 neutralized 62% of 181 pseudoviruses with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) <50 μg ml(-1). The median IC50 of neutralized viruses was 0.033 μg ml(-1), among the most potent thus far described. 35O22 did not bind monomeric forms of Env tested, but did bind the trimeric BG505 SOSIP.664. Mutagenesis and a reconstruction by negative-stain electron microscopy of the Fab in complex with trimer revealed that it bound to a conserved epitope, which stretched across gp120 and gp41. The specificity of 35O22 represents a novel site of vulnerability on HIV Env, which serum analysis indicates to be commonly elicited by natural infection. Binding to this new site of vulnerability may thus be an important complement to current monoclonal-antibody-based approaches to immunotherapies, prophylaxis and vaccine design."

https://openalex.org/W1977572530,"Endogenous RNA transcripts are shown to mediate recombination with yeast chromosomal DNA; as the level of RNAs in the nucleus is quite high, these results may open up new understanding of the plasticity of repair and genome instability mechanisms. As the name implies, DNA repair by homologous recombination generally is thought of as occurring between two DNA molecules. However, it has been shown that RNA can also be used in artificial settings. Francesca Storici and colleagues now demonstrate that endogenous RNA transcripts can mediate recombination with yeast chromosomal DNA. This result suggest that the direct flow of genetic information from RNA to DNA in cells might be much more common than was thought, and as the level of RNA in the nucleus is quite high, these results may open up a new understanding of the plasticity of repair and genome instability mechanisms. Homologous recombination is a molecular process that has multiple important roles in DNA metabolism, both for DNA repair and genetic variation in all forms of life1. Generally, homologous recombination involves the exchange of genetic information between two identical or nearly identical DNA molecules1; however, homologous recombination can also occur between RNA molecules, as shown for RNA viruses2. Previous research showed that synthetic RNA oligonucleotides can act as templates for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in yeast and human cells3,4, and artificial long RNA templates injected in ciliate cells can guide genomic rearrangements5. Here we report that endogenous transcript RNA mediates homologous recombination with chromosomal DNA in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed a system to detect the events of homologous recombination initiated by transcript RNA following the repair of a chromosomal DSB occurring either in a homologous but remote locus, or in the same transcript-generating locus in reverse-transcription-defective yeast strains. We found that RNA–DNA recombination is blocked by ribonucleases H1 and H2. In the presence of H-type ribonucleases, DSB repair proceeds through a complementary DNA intermediate, whereas in their absence, it proceeds directly through RNA. The proximity of the transcript to its chromosomal DNA partner in the same locus facilitates Rad52-driven homologous recombination during DSB repair. We demonstrate that yeast and human Rad52 proteins efficiently catalyse annealing of RNA to a DSB-like DNA end in vitro. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of homologous recombination and DNA repair in which transcript RNA is used as a template for DSB repair. Thus, considering the abundance of RNA transcripts in cells, RNA may have a marked impact on genomic stability and plasticity."

These structures are seen in maps derived from spectroscopic surveys that reveal networks of structure that are interconnected with no clear boundaries. Extended regions with a high concentration of galaxies are called 'superclusters', although this term is not precise. There is, however, another way to analyse the structure. If the distance to each galaxy from Earth is directly measured, then the peculiar velocity can be derived from the subtraction of the mean cosmic expansion, the product of distance times the Hubble constant, from observed velocity. The peculiar velocity is the line-of-sight departure from the cosmic expansion and arises from gravitational perturbations; a map of peculiar velocities can be translated into a map of the distribution of matter. Here we report a map of structure made using a catalogue of peculiar velocities. We find locations where peculiar velocity flows diverge, as water does at watershed divides, and we trace the surface of divergent points that surrounds us. Within the volume enclosed by this surface, the motions of galaxies are inward after removal of the mean cosmic expansion and long range flows. We define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster, which we call Laniakea.

https://openalex.org/W2054981831,"SWEETs and their prokaryotic homologues are monosaccharide and disaccharide transporters that are present from Archaea to plants and humans. SWEETs play crucial roles in cellular sugar efflux processes: that is, in phloem loading, pollen nutrition and nectar secretion. Their bacterial homologues, which are called SemiSWEETs, are among the smallest known transporters. Here we show that SemiSWEET molecules, which consist of a triple-helix bundle, form symmetrical, parallel dimers, thereby generating the translocation pathway. Two SemiSWEET isoforms were crystallized, one in an apparently open state and one in an occluded state, indicating that SemiSWEETs and SWEETs are transporters that undergo rocking-type movements during the transport cycle. The topology of the triple-helix bundle is similar yet distinct to that of the basic building block of animal and plant major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters (for example, GLUTs and SUTs). This finding indicates two possibilities: that SWEETs and MFS transporters evolved from an ancestral triple-helix bundle or that the triple-helix bundle represents convergent evolution. In SemiSWEETs and SWEETs, two triple-helix bundles are arranged in a parallel configuration to produce the 6- and 6 + 1-transmembrane-helix pores, respectively. In the 12-transmembrane-helix MFS transporters, four triple-helix bundles are arranged into an alternating antiparallel configuration, resulting in a much larger 2 × 2 triple-helix bundle forming the pore. Given the similarity of SemiSWEETs and SWEETs to PQ-loop amino acid transporters and to mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs), the structures characterized here may also be relevant to other transporters in the MtN3 clan. The insight gained from the structures of these transporters and from the analysis of mutations of conserved residues will improve the understanding of the transport mechanism, as well as allow comparative studies of the different superfamilies involved in sugar transport and the evolution of transporters in general."
https://openalex.org/W2020559800,"During the last several years, various chemical methods have been used for synthesis of a variety of metal nanoparticles. Most of these methods pose severe environmental problems and biological risks; therefore the present study reports a biological route for synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles using Pseudomonas aeruginosa rhamnolipids (RLs) (denoted as RL@ZnO) and their antioxidant property. Formation of stable RL@ZnO nanoparticles gave mostly spherical particles with a particle size ranging from 35 to 80 nm. The RL@ZnO nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermal gravimetric analysis. The UV-vis spectra presented a characteristic absorbance peak at ∼ 360 nm for synthesized RL@ZnO nanoparticles. The XRD spectrum showed that RL@ZnO nanoparticles are crystalline in nature and have typical wurtzite type polycrystals. Antioxidant potential of RL@ZnO nanoparticles was assessed through 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl, and superoxide anion free radicals with varying concentration and time of the storage up to 15 months, while it was found to decline in bare ZnO nanoparticles. Similarly, the inhibitory effects on β-carotene oxidation and lipid peroxidation were also observed. These results elucidate the significance of P. aeruginosa RL as effective stabilizing agents to develop surface protective ZnO nanoparticles, which can be used as promising antioxidants in biological system."

https://openalex.org/W1964743951,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulatory molecules in tumor suppressor and oncogenic pathways. However, the magnitude of the contribution of lncRNA expression to normal human tissues and cancers has not been investigated in a comprehensive manner. Here we explored the biology of the lncRNA MALAT1 and considered the potential significance in mesenchymal stem cells from myeloma patients. By using assays such as RNA interference, luciferase, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and RNA immunoprecipitation, we showed that in mesenchymal stem cells MALAT1 promoted the activation effect of the key transcription factor Sp1 on LTBP3 promoter by modulating recruitment of Sp1 to the LTBP3 gene that regulated the bioavailability of TGF-β in particular. Our data suggested that lncRNA MALAT1 directly interacted with Sp1 and LTBP3 promoter to increase expression of LTBP3 gene. The specificity and efficiency of activation were ensured by the formation of a stable complex between MALAT1 and the LTBP3 promoter, direct interaction of MALAT1 with Sp1, and recruitment of Sp1 to the promoter. In this study, we showed that the mechanism of transcriptional activation of LTBP3 promoter depended on MALAT1 initiated from neighboring gene LTBP3 and involved both the direct interaction of the Sp1 and promoter-specific activation. Our knowledge of the role of MALAT1 in cellular transformation is pointing toward its potential use as a biomarker and a target for novel therapeutic approaches in multiple myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W2113694503,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a major positive regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a principle trigger of cell death, under the condition of oxidative stress. However, the mechanism by which cytosolic GSK-3β translocates to mitochondria, promoting mPTP opening, remains unclear. Here we addressed this issue by analyses of the effect of site-directed mutations in GSK-3β on mitochondrial translocation and protein/protein interactions upon oxidative stress. H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were transfected with GFP-tagged GSK-3β (WT), a mutant GSK-3β insensitive to inhibitory phosphorylation (S9A), or kinase-deficient GSK-3β (K85R). Time lapse observation revealed that WT and S9A translocated from the cytosol to the mitochondria more promptly than did K85R after exposure to oxidative stress. H2O2 increased the density of nine spots on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of anti-GSK-3β-immunoprecipitates by more than 3-fold. MALDI-TOF/MS analysis revealed that one of the spots contained voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2). Knockdown of VDAC2, but not VDAC1 or VDAC3, by siRNA attenuated both the mitochondrial translocation of GSK-3β and mPTP opening under stress conditions. The mitochondrial translocation of GSK-3β was attenuated also when Lys-15, but not Arg-4 or Arg-6, in the N-terminal domain of GSK-3β was replaced with alanine. The oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial translocation of GSK-3β was associated with an increase in cell death, which was suppressed by lithium chloride (LiCl), a GSK-3β inhibitor. These results demonstrate that GSK-3β translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria in a kinase activity- and VDAC2-dependent manner in which an N-terminal domain of GSK-3β may function as a mitochondrial targeting sequence.

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that mitochondria play crucial roles not only in ATP production as a powerhouse but also in mechanisms of cell death.

Once opened, the mPTP allows entry of any molecule of <1.5 kDa, resulting in matrix swelling and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, which induce outer membrane disruption and ATP depletion, respectively. Opening of the mPTP is triggered by several factors including Ca2+ overload, oxidative stress, elevated phosphate concentration, and adenine nucleotide depletion (1.Miura T. Tanno M.

However, GSK-3β inhibitors potentially have serious adverse effects because of the multifunctional nature and ubiquitous presence of GSK-3β. In fact, knock-out of GSK-3β in mice is embryonic lethal (21.Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R.

Therefore, for clinical application of GSK-3β inhibition to tissue protection, it is crucial to specifically suppress GSK-3β relevant to promotion of mPTP opening. To this end, we focused on the mechanism of GSK-3β translocation to mitochondria and its impact on cell viability in the present study. We demonstrated that GSK-3β translocates to the mitochondria in a kinase activity-dependent manner under the condition of oxidative stress. The translocation is facilitated by interaction with VDAC2 in which an N-terminal domain of GSK-3β may also be involved as a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The results indicate that VDAC2 and the N-terminal domain of GSK-3β are novel therapeutic targets for various pathological conditions including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. H9c2 or HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were used for experiments when they were 70–90% confluent. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared by using a mitochondrial isolation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

To construct a GSK-3β-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, the coding region of rat GSK-3β cDNA lacking its stop codon was cloned into the vector pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) at the BglII and SalI sites and in-frame with the enhanced GFP coding region. To construct a constitutively active (S9A), kinase-deficient (K85R), and mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) mutant (R4A, R6A, and K15A) GSK-3β, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. H9c2 cells were transfected with each plasmid using Cell Line Nucleofector kit L (Lonza) and used for further analyses. Transfection efficiencies were ∼10% for wild type, S9A, K85R, R4A, R6A, and K15A and ∼25% for GFP control. To generate an expression vector for FLAG-tagged VDAC2, the coding region of VDAC2 was amplified from rat cDNA by PCR using LA Taq with GC buffer (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and the following primers: 5′-AAAAGCGGCCGCGATGGCTGAATGTTGTGTACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAAGGATCCTTAAGCCTCCAATTCCAAGG-3′ (reverse). The PCR fragment was cloned into the NotI and BamHI sites of p3xFLAG-CMVTM-7.1 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich). The cDNA sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Three different siRNAs for VDAC isoforms were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys siRNA Service, and the one that most efficiently suppressed the expression of VDAC mRNA was used in the present study. The sequences of sense and antisense siRNA were: VDAC1, GAUACACUCAGACUCUAAATT (sense) and UUUAGAGUCUGAGUGUAUCTT (antisense); VDAC2, CAGAAAGUAUGUGAAGAUUTT (sense) and AAUCUUCACAUACUUUCUGTT (antisense); and VDAC3, GACUCUUGAUACCAUAUUUTT (sense) and AAAUAUGGUAUCAAGAGUCTT (antisense). Transfection of siRNA (100 nmol/liter) into cells was performed using a Nucleofector kit (Lonza). Two days after transfection, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red (Invitrogen) for 7 min and put in an incubator on an inverted microscope (TE2000-E, Nikon) in the presence or absence of H2O2 (10 µmol/liter). Images were obtained by time lapse laser scanning for 40 ms every 6 s using a charge-coupled device camera (ORCA-AG, Hamamatsu Photonics) for 15 min and then analyzed with AQUACOSMOS software (Hamamatsu Photonics). Still images of MitoTracker Red staining and GFP-GSK-3β signal before and 3 min after exposure to H2O2 at a magnification of 400× were further analyzed by image analysis software (Photoshop CS6, Adobe). The background fluorescence was cut off using a constant threshold value before the images were merged. Pixels positive for MitoTracker Red (total mitochondria) and pixels positive for both MitoTracker Red and GFP-GSK-3β (GFP-positive mitochondria) were counted, and the ratio of the latter to the former (GFP-positive mitochondria/total mitochondria) was used as an index for the mitochondrial localization of GFP-GSK-3β constructs. H9c2 cells were transfected with VDAC2 siRNA or control siRNA and stained with Mito Tracker Red (0.2 µmol/liter) for 15 min, and time lapse observation of the mitochondrial morphology was achieved by N-SIM super-resolution microscopy (Nikon). To construct a super-resolution image, nine images (three different directions for three different phases) were captured in 2D-SIM mode with a temporal resolution of 0.6 s/frame. Super-resolution images were recorded every 10 s for 15 min for the time lapse observation. Intracellular ROS levels were monitored by DCF fluorescence (Invitrogen). H9c2 cells were loaded with DCF according to the manufacturer's protocol. DCF-loaded cells underwent 120-min hypoxia/30-min reoxygenation using hypoxic GasPak pouches (BD Biosciences) or exposure to antimycin A (50 µmol/liter) for 1 h in the presence of LiCl or a vehicle. Treatment with LiCl or the vehicle was started 30 min before hypoxia/reoxygenation or antimycin A exposure and continued until the end of the experiments. DCF fluorescence was recorded by a FLoid Cell Imaging Station (Invitrogen) at 1 h after exposure to antimycin A or at 30 min after reoxygenation. To determine the level of superoxide production in cells expressing GFP-tagged GSK-3β, a Total ROS/Superoxide Detection kit (Enzo Life Sciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were loaded with Superoxide Detection Solution and then incubated for 30 min. After washing the cells twice with wash buffer, the cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence images of orange fluorescence, indicating superoxide, in GFP-positive cells at a magnification of 400× were analyzed by counting positive pixels per cell by image analysis software (Photoshop CS6, Adobe). The LDH activity of the culture medium was assayed with CytoTox96 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LDH activity in the medium as a percentage of total cellular LDH activity in the well was used as an index of cell necrosis. Mitochondrial permeability was monitored by calcein using an Image-iTTM LIVE Mitochondrial Transition Pore Assay kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modification. Cells were incubated with 0.25 µmol/liter calcein and MitoTracker Red for 15 min, and the medium was changed to calcein-free medium containing 4 mmol/liter cobalt chloride (CoCl2). CoCl2 does not reach inside mitochondria and quenches cytosolic calcein fluorescence, resulting in selective mitochondrial accumulation of calcein as long as the mPTPs are closed. After 15-min incubation, cells were pretreated with 30 mmol/liter LiCl or a vehicle for 60 min before treatment with 100 µmol/liter H2O2 for 2 h. The calcein-stained area overlapped with the MitoTracker Red-stained area was used as an index of mitochondria with closed mPTPs, and the extent of mPTP opening was determined by the decline in the ratio of the overlapped area to the MitoTracker Red-stained area (calcein-positive mitochondria/total mitochondria). Whole cell lysates of H9c2 cells exposed to H2O2 or a vehicle were harvested using CellLytic-M Mammalian Cell Lysis/Extraction agent (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at −80 °C for later use. The samples were immunoprecipitated with a GSK-3β antibody (Abcam) as reported previously (18.Nishihara M. Miura T. Miki T. Tanno M. Yano T. Naitoh K. Ohori K. Hotta H. Terashima Y. Shimamoto K. Modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex in GSK-3β-mediated myocardial protection.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 43: 564-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were then separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis using a ReadyPrepTM 2-D Starter kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions as follows. The protein samples were mixed with Rehydration Buffer (Bio-Rad) for isoelectrical focusing. The immobilized pH gradient gel strips (pH range, 3–10; 7 cm; Bio-Rad) were rehydrated in 125 µl of samples diluted with ReadyPrep Rehydration/Sample Buffer with a final protein concentration of 0.6 g/µl for 12 h at 20 °C. Isoelectric focusing was performed on the pre-rehydrated immobilized pH gradient gel strips at 20 °C in four steps: (i) 250 V for 15 min and (ii) 4000 V for 1 h in a linear mode where voltage increases are in a linear fashion to the set voltage followed by (iii) 4000 V for 3 h and (iv) 500 V for 24 h in a rapid mode where voltage is limited by the set current value using a Protean isoelectric focusing cell (Bio-Rad). When isoelectrical focusing was completed, the focused immobilized pH gradient strips were incubated in Equilibration Buffer I (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, and 2% (w/v) DTT) from the ReadyPrep 2-D Starter kit for 20 min with gentle shaking. Then Equilibration Buffer I was discarded, and Equilibration Buffer II (containing iodoacetamide) was added to each strip with gentle shaking for 10 min. Strips were then mounted on top of 12% gels (Mini-Protean TGX Precast Gels, Bio-Rad) in wells filled with warm agarose (0.5% low melting point agarose in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and a trace of bromphenol blue). The gel box apparatus was filled with running buffer, and the gels were run at 150 V for 1 h. After second dimension electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue at 4 °C for 24 h, scanned by a laser scanner (GT-X970, Epson), and then analyzed using PDQuest 2-D Analysis Software. A total of eight gels, four for vehicle-treated cells and four for H2O2-exposed cells, were analyzed under the same experimental conditions. Nine protein spots with an increase in stain density of 3-fold or more in response to H2O2 stimulation were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS. Spots of interest in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels were excised in small cubes of ∼1 mm square in size. After reduction and alkylation, in-gel digestion was performed with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were subsequently separated on a HiQsilC18W-3 column (100-µm inner diameter × 100 mm; KYA Technology, Tokyo, Japan). 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; solvent A) and 0.1% TFA in 70% acetonitrile (solvent B) were used for elution. The gradient was 5–50% for solvent B over 50 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Separated peptides were spotted onto 384-well AB OptiTOF MALDI plate inserts (AB Sciex). Peptide fractions were collected every 30 s, and 150-nl peptide fractions were overlaid with 700 nl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 80 mg/ml ammonium citrate, 70% acetonitrile, and 0.1% TFA. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a 4800 Plus MALDI-TOF/TOF Analyzer (AB Sciex) with 4000 Series Explorer version 3.5 software (AB Sciex). A tryptic BSA standard (KYA Technology) and a six-peptide mixture (AB Sciex) were used to calibrate the mass accuracy. MS/MS acquisitions of MS spectra with a signal to noise ratio over 100 were carried out using air as the collision gas and a collision energy of 1 kV. Data were processed by Protein Pilot versions 2.0 and 3.0 (AB Sciex) using the Paragon search algorithm (23.Shilov I.V. Seymour S.L. Patel A.A. Loboda A. Tang W.H. Keating S.P. Hunter C.L. Nuwaysir L.M. Schaeffer D.A. The Paragon Algorithm, a next generation search engine that uses sequence temperature values and feature probabilities to identify peptides from tandem mass spectra.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1638-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). TOF/MS data were searched against the human International Protein Index database (version 3.63). Group mean data are shown as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was used for testing differences among group mean data. Differences between groups in response to oxidative stress were examined by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. When analysis of variance indicated a significant overall difference, multiple comparisons were performed using the Student-Newman-Keul post hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To explore the mechanism of GSK-3β translocation to mitochondria, we first examined the relationship between kinase activity of GSK-3β and extent of mitochondrial translocation of GSK-3β in response to oxidative stress. We prepared GFP-tagged wild-type GSK-3β (WT) and its site-directed mutants, constitutively active GSK-3β (S9A) and kinase-deficient GSK-3β (K85R). H9c2 cells were transfected with WT, S9A, or K85R and stained with MitoTracker Red, and time lapse observation by fluorescence microscopy was performed during 15-min exposure to H2O2 (10 µmol/liter). WT gradually translocated from the cytosol to the mitochondria as indicated by an increase in overlap of green fluorescence and red fluorescence (Fig. 1, A and B). The mitochondrial translocation of WT was followed by cell death as revealed by plasma membrane disruption and severe cell deformation. S9A signals appeared to be present in some of the mitochondria even before H2O2 challenge, and S9A translocated to the mitochondria more promptly than did WT, leading to cell death (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2 and supplemental Movie 1A). In contrast, mitochondrial translocation of K85R was much slower than that of WT and was accompanied by a lower prevalence of cell death compared with that of WT or S9A (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2. and supplemental Movie 1B). These findings indicate that mitochondrial translocation of GSK-3β is dependent on its kinase activity, although involvement of a factor besides GSK-3β activity is indicated by a low but significant level of co-localization of K85R with mitochondria. This notion was further supported by the finding that treatment with LiCl, which reduces GSK-3β activity both directly and by increasing inhibitory Ser-9 phosphorylation (24.Jope R.S. Lithium and GSK-3: one inhibitor, two inhibitory actions, multiple outcomes.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 441-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), reduced mitochondrial localization of WT both before and after exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The GFP control that was not tagged with GSK-3β remained only in the cytoplasm throughout the experiments (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that fusion with GFP per se did not induce translocation of GSK-3β. Although GFP-tagged GSK-3β might not have behaved exactly the same as endogenous GSK-3β because of its large molecular size (32.7 kDa) and the biophysical property of GFP, mitochondrial translocation of endogenous GSK-3β induced by H2O2 was confirmed by Western blotting for mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of H9c2 cells (Fig. 1C) as was GSK-3β in the rat myocardium (18.Nishihara M. Miura T. Miki T. Tanno M. Yano T. Naitoh K. Ohori K. Hotta H. Terashima Y. Shimamoto K. Modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex in GSK-3β-mediated myocardial protection.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 43: 564-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amount of GSK-3β co-immunoprecipitated with cyclophilin D, a matrix protein, and with Rieske, a subunit of complex III, increased after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1D), suggesting that GSK-3β resides in the matrix side of the inner membrane after the translocation.FIGURE 2.Activity of GSK-3β is associated with cell death. LDH activity in the culture medium was measured at 4 h after addition of H2O2 (100 µmol/liter). -Fold increases in LDH activity compared with the baseline value are shown. *, p < 0.05 versus GFP control. Error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results of quantitative analyses of cell death indicated an association of cell death with mitochondrial translocation of GSK-3β. LDH activity in the culture medium during 4-h treatment with H2O2 (100 µmol/liter), a dose and duration that induced cell death in 12% of H9c2 cells in preliminary experiments, was significantly increased by transfection with WT or S9A, but not by transfection with K85R, compared with GFP control (Fig. 2). As expected, inhibition of GSK-3β by LiCl significantly inhibited the LDH release. The insignificant effect of transfection with K85R on LDH release is most likely explained by low transfection efficiency (∼10%) by nucleofection. Next, we examined whether production of ROS under the condition of pathological stress is regulated by GSK-3β activity. We used two different stimuli to induce ROS production in mitochondria, namely hypoxia/reoxygenation and antimycin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III (25.Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H.

https://openalex.org/W1996974531,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet and is suggested to be a potential antiatherosclerotic agent due to its proposed hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CGA on atherosclerosis development in ApoE(-/-) mice and its potential mechanism. ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet without (control) or with CGA (200 and 400 mg/kg) or atorvastatin (4 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. During the study plasma lipid and inflammatory parameters were determined. Treatment with CGA (400 mg/kg) reduced atherosclerotic lesion area and vascular dilatation in the aortic root, comparable to atorvastatin. CGA (400 mg/kg) also significantly decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol as well as inflammatory markers. Supplementation with CGA or CGA metabolites-containing serum suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced lipid accumulation and stimulated cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 cells. CGA significantly increased the mRNA levels of PPARγ, LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 as well as the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Cholesterol efflux assay showed that three major metabolites, caffeic, ferulic and gallic acids, significantly stimulated cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest that CGA potently reduces atherosclerosis development in ApoE(-/-) mice and promotes cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 macrophages. Caffeic, ferulic and gallic acids may be the potential active compounds accounting for the in vivo effect of CGA."
https://openalex.org/W1975673306,"Background The dysregulated expressions of circulating miRNAs have been detected in various cardiovascular diseases. In our previous experiments, the altered expressions of circulating miRNA-21-5p, miRNA-361-5p and miRNA-519e-5p were confirmed in patients with coronary atherosclerosis by miRNA microarrays. However, the expression levels of these circulating miRNAs in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are still unknown. In the present study, our aims were to examine the expressions of circulating miR-21-5p, miR-361-5p and miR-519e-5p in AMI patients, and assess their clinical applications for diagnosing and monitoring AMI. Results Two different cohorts were enrolled in this study. The first cohort included 17 AMI patients and 28 healthy volunteers, and the second cohort included 9 AMI patients, 9 ischemic stroke patients, 8 patients with pulmonary embolism, and 12 healthy volunteers. Quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA assays were preformed to detect the concentrations of plasma miRNAs and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), respectively. The results showed that the plasma levels of miR-21-5p and miR-361-5p were significantly increased in AMI patients, whereas the concentration of circulating miR-519e-5p was reduced. Interestingly, the levels of these circulating miRNAs correlated with the concentrations of plasma cTnI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that these three circulating miRNAs had considerable diagnostic accuracy for AMI with high values of area under ROC curve (AUC). Importantly, combining the three miRNAs significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, cell experiments demonstrated that these plasma miRNAs may originate from injured cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia. In addition, the levels of all the three circulating miRNAs in ischemic stroke (IS) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were elevated, whereas the decreased level of plasma miR-519e-5p was only detected in AMI. ROC analysis demonstrated that circulating miR-519e-5p may be a useful biomarker for distinguishing AMI from other ischemic diseases. Conclusions Circulating miRNAs may be novel and powerful biomarkers for AMI and they could be potential diagnostic tool for AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2067579927,"Background Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released from Gram-negative bacteria can serve as vehicles for the translocation of virulence factors. Vibrio cholerae produce OMVs but their putative role in translocation of effectors involved in pathogenesis has not been well elucidated. The V. cholerae cytolysin (VCC), is a pore-forming toxin that lyses target eukaryotic cells by forming transmembrane oligomeric β-barrel channels. It is considered a potent toxin that contributes to V. cholerae pathogenesis. The mechanisms involved in the secretion and delivery of the VCC have not been extensively studied. Methodology/Principal Findings OMVs from V. cholerae strains were isolated and purified using a differential centrifugation procedure and Optiprep centrifugation. The ultrastructure and the contents of OMVs were examined under the electron microscope and by immunoblot analyses respectively. We demonstrated that VCC from V. cholerae strain V:5/04 was secreted in association with OMVs and the release of VCC via OMVs is a common feature among V. cholerae strains. The biological activity of OMV-associated VCC was investigated using contact hemolytic assay and epithelial cell cytotoxicity test. It showed toxic activity on both red blood cells and epithelial cells. Our results indicate that the OMVs architecture might play a role in stability of VCC and thereby can enhance its biological activities in comparison with the free secreted VCC. Furthermore, we tested the role of OMV-associated VCC in host cell autophagy signalling using confocal microscopy and immunoblot analysis. We observed that OMV-associated VCC triggered an autophagy response in the target cell and our findings demonstrated for the first time that autophagy may operate as a cellular defence mechanism against an OMV-associated bacterial virulence factor. Conclusion/Significance Biological assays of OMVs from the V. cholerae strain V:5/04 demonstrated that OMV-associated VCC is indeed biologically active and induces toxicity on mammalian cells and furthermore can induce autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2091510620,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment and commonly diagnosed only on late stages. Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and exacerbated tau phosphorylation are molecular hallmarks of AD implicated in cognitive deficits and synaptic and neuronal loss. The Aβ and tau connection is beginning to be elucidated and attributed to interaction with different components of common signaling pathways. Recent evidences suggest that non-fibrillary Aβ forms bind to membrane receptors and modulate GSK-3β activity, which in turn phosphorylates the microtubule-associated tau protein leading to axonal disruption and toxic accumulation. Available AD animal models, ranging from rodent to invertebrates, significantly contributed to our current knowledge, but complementary platforms for mechanistic and candidate drug screenings remain critical for the identification of early stage biomarkers and potential disease-modifying therapies. Here we show that Aβ1–42 injection in the hindbrain ventricle of 24 hpf zebrafish embryos results in specific cognitive deficits and increased tau phosphorylation in GSK-3β target residues at 5dpf larvae. These effects are reversed by lithium incubation and not accompanied by apoptotic markers. We believe this may represent a straightforward platform useful to identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms of early stage AD-like symptoms and the effects of neuroactive molecules in pharmacological screenings."
https://openalex.org/W2014969421,"Given the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens, antimicrobial peptides that can also modulate the immune response may be a novel approach for effectively controlling periodontal infections. In the present study, we used a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture model of gingival epithelial cells and fibroblasts stimulated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of human beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3) and cathelicidin (LL-37) and to determine whether these antimicrobial peptides can act in synergy. The 3D co-culture model composed of gingival fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix overlaid with gingival epithelial cells had a synergistic effect with respect to the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 in response to LPS stimulation compared to fibroblasts and epithelial cells alone. The 3D co-culture model was stimulated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of hBD-3 (10 and 20 µM) and LL-37 (0.1 and 0.2 µM) individually and in combination in the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS. A multiplex ELISA assay was used to quantify the secretion of 41 different cytokines. hBD-3 and LL-37 acted in synergy to reduce the secretion of GRO-alpha, G-CSF, IP-10, IL-6, and MCP-1, but only had an additive effect on reducing the secretion of IL-8 in response to A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS stimulation. The present study showed that hBD-3 acted in synergy with LL-37 to reduce the secretion of cytokines by an LPS-stimulated 3D model of gingival mucosa. This combination of antimicrobial peptides thus shows promising potential as an adjunctive therapy for treating inflammatory periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W1981721092,"Brain and vascular cells form a functionally integrated signalling network that is known as the neurovascular unit (NVU). The signalling (autocrine, paracrine and juxtacrine) between different elements of this unit, especially in humans, is difficult to disentangle in vivo. Developing representative in vitro models is therefore essential to better understand the cellular interactions that govern the neurovascular environment. We here describe a novel approach to assay these cellular interactions by combining a human adult cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) with a fetal ganglionic eminence-derived neural stem cell (hNSC) line. These cell lines provide abundant homogeneous populations of cells to produce a consistently reproducible in vitro model of endothelial morphogenesis and the ensuing NVU. Vasculature-like structures (VLS) interspersed with patches of differentiating neural cells only occurred when hNSCs were seeded onto a differentiated endothelium. These VLS emerged within 3 days of coculture and by day 6 were stabilizing. After 7 days of coculture, neuronal differentiation of hNSCs was increased 3-fold, but had no significant effect on astrocyte or oligodendrocyte differentiation. ZO1, a marker of adherens and tight junctions, was highly expressed in both undifferentiated and differentiated endothelial cells, but the adherens junction markers CD31 and VE-cadherin were significantly reduced in coculture by approximately 20%. A basement membrane, consisting of laminin, vitronectin, and collagen I and IV, separated the VLS from neural patches. This simple assay can assist in elucidating the cellular and molecular signaling involved in the formation of VLS, as well as the enhancement of neuronal differentiation through endothelial signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2129485812,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common and deadly inherited disease, caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that encodes a cAMP-activated chloride channel. One outstanding manifestation of the disease is the persistent bacterial infection and inflammation in the lung, which claims over 90% of CF mortality. It has been debated whether neutrophil-mediated phagocytic innate immunity has any intrinsic defect that contributes to the host lung defense failure. Here we compared phagosomal CFTR targeting, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) production, and microbial killing of the neutrophils from myeloid Cftr-inactivated (Myeloid-Cftr-/-) mice and the non-inactivated control (Cftrfl10) mice. We found that the mutant CFTR that lacked Exon-10 failed to target to the neutrophil phagosomes. This dysfunction resulted in impaired intraphagosomal HOCl production and neutrophil microbial killing. In vivo lung infection with a lethal dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused significantly higher mortality in the myeloid CF mice than in the controls. The myeloid-Cftr-/- lungs were deficient in bacterial clearance, and had sustained neutrophilic inflammation and stalled transition from early to late immunity. These manifestations recapitulated the symptoms of human CF lungs. The data altogether suggest that myeloid CFTR expression is critical to normal host lung defense. CFTR dysfunction in neutrophils compromises the phagocytic innate immunity, which may predispose CF lungs to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2089622171,"Inclusions dissolved in a colloidal membrane assemble into highly uniform finite-sized liquid droplets or rafts consisting of thousands of molecules. The separation of suspensions into distinct liquid phases is important in processes such as gel formation, protein crystallization and in processes in cellular biology. Liquid–liquid phase separation in bulk proceeds through continuous coalescence of droplets until the system completely phase separates. But things get more complicated when suspended colloids, nanoparticles or proteins are confined to interfaces or membranes. Prerna Sharma et al. now show that liquid–liquid phase separation in monolayer membranes composed of two dissimilar chiral colloidal rods yields stable rafts that assemble into cluster crystals at high densities, but also form bonds to create higher-order structures. Detailed observations reveal that membrane distortions arising from the rods' chirality are crucial for stabilizing and assembling the monodisperse membrane clusters, suggesting that chiral inclusions in membranes might more generally have a role in stabilizing assemblages of finite size. Liquid–liquid phase separation is ubiquitous in suspensions of nanoparticles, proteins and colloids. It has an important role in gel formation, protein crystallization and perhaps even as an organizing principle in cellular biology1,2. With a few notable exceptions3,4, liquid–liquid phase separation in bulk proceeds through the continuous coalescence of droplets until the system undergoes complete phase separation. But when colloids, nanoparticles or proteins are confined to interfaces, surfaces or membranes, their interactions differ fundamentally from those mediated by isotropic solvents5,6, and this results in significantly more complex phase behaviour7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here we show that liquid–liquid phase separation in monolayer membranes composed of two dissimilar chiral colloidal rods gives rise to thermodynamically stable rafts that constantly exchange monomeric rods with the background reservoir to maintain a self-limited size. We visualize and manipulate rafts to quantify their assembly kinetics and to show that membrane distortions arising from the rods’ chirality lead to long-range repulsive raft–raft interactions. Rafts assemble into cluster crystals at high densities, but they can also form bonds to yield higher-order structures. Taken together, our observations demonstrate a robust membrane-based pathway for the assembly of monodisperse membrane clusters that is complementary to existing methods for colloid assembly in bulk suspensions14,15,16. They also reveal that chiral inclusions in membranes can acquire long-range repulsive interactions, which might more generally have a role in stabilizing assemblages of finite size13,17."

https://openalex.org/W2038637047,"Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs), a biologically active component of grape seeds, have been reported to possess a wide array of pharmacological and biochemical properties. Recently, the inhibitory effects of GSPs on various cancers have been reported, but their effects on cervical cancer remain unclear. Here, we explored the effect of GSPs on cervical cancer using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, the treatment of HeLa and SiHa cells with GSPs resulted in a significant inhibition of cell viability. Further investigation indicated that GSPs led to the dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. The underlying mechanism was associated with increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bak-1, decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the activation of caspase-3, suggesting that GSPs induced cervical cancer cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, the administration of GSPs (0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4%, w/v) as a supplement in drinking water significantly inhibited the tumor growth of HeLa and SiHa cells in athymic nude mice, and the number of apoptotic cells in those tumors was also increased significantly. Taken together, our studies demonstrated that GSPs could inhibit the growth of cervical cancer by inducing apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, which provides evidence indicating that GSPs may be a potential chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent for cervical cancer."

If midlife obesity prevalence was decreased to 20% and normal weight increased to 40% over the period of 2015-2025, then dementia cases among persons aged 65-69 years would be lower by about 10% in 2050 compared with the ""doing nothing to stop current trends in obesity"" projection.The rising tide of obesity in Australian adults will increase the dementia epidemic expected in future years."

Of importance to their pain management is older people's interaction with health professionals that, if unsatisfactory, may impair the outcome. Aims To add to the limited research specific to older people living with chronic pain in the community, we explored how they perceive their experiences of interacting with health professionals, seeking factors that might optimise these interactions. Methods Purposive sampling was used to recruit men and women >65 years with self-reported musculoskeletal chronic pain. Qualitative individual interviews and one group interview were undertaken with 23 participants. Data were transcribed verbatim and underwent Framework Analysis. Results Three themes were identified. Seeking help illustrates issues around why older people in the community may or may not seek help for chronic pain, and highlights the potential involvement of social comparison. Importance of diagnosis illustrates the desire for professional validation of their condition and an aversion to vague explanations based on the person's age. Being listened to and being heard illustrates the importance of empathic communication and understanding expectations, with due respect for the person's age. Conclusions In common with people of all ages, an effective partnership between an older person in pain and health professionals is essential if pain is to be reported, appropriately assessed and managed, because of the subjective nature of pain and its treatment responses. For older people with pain, perception about their age, by both parties in the partnership, is an additional factor that can unnecessarily interfere with the effectiveness of this partnership. Health professionals should engage with older adults to clarify their expectations about pain and its management, which may be influenced by perceptions about age; and to encourage expression of their concerns, which may also be affected by perceptions about age."
https://openalex.org/W2064599015,"Among other stressors, age and mechanical constraints significantly influence regeneration cascades in bone healing. Here, our aim was to identify genes and, through their functional annotation, related biological processes that are influenced by an interaction between the effects of mechanical fixation stability and age. Therefore, at day three post-osteotomy, chip-based whole-genome gene expression analyses of fracture hematoma tissue were performed for four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats with a 1.5-mm osteotomy gap in the femora with varying age (12 vs. 52 weeks - biologically challenging) and external fixator stiffness (mechanically challenging). From 31099 analysed genes, 1103 genes were differentially expressed between the six possible combinations of the four groups and from those 144 genes were identified as statistically significantly influenced by the interaction between age and fixation stability. Functional annotation of these differentially expressed genes revealed an association with extracellular space, cell migration or vasculature development. The chip-based whole-genome gene expression data was validated by q-RT-PCR at days three and seven post-osteotomy for MMP-9 and MMP-13, members of the mechanosensitive matrix metalloproteinase family and key players in cell migration and angiogenesis. Furthermore, we observed an interaction of age and mechanical stimuli in vitro on cell migration of mesenchymal stromal cells. These cells are a subpopulation of the fracture hematoma and are known to be key players in bone regeneration. In summary, these data correspond to and might explain our previously described biomechanical healing outcome after six weeks in response to fixation stiffness variation. In conclusion, our data highlight the importance of analysing the influence of risk factors of fracture healing (e.g. advanced age, suboptimal fixator stability) in combination rather than alone."
https://openalex.org/W2040704781,"Defining how leukocytes adhere to solid surfaces, such as capillary beds, and the subsequent migration through the extracellular matrix, is a central biological issue. We show here that phospholipase D (PLD) and its enzymatic reaction product, phosphatidic acid (PA), regulate cell adhesion of immune cells (macrophages and neutrophils) to collagen and have defined the underlying molecular mechanism in a spatio-temporal manner that coincides with PLD activity timing. A rapid (t½ = 4 min) and transient activation of the PLD1 isoform occurs upon adhesion, and a slower (t½ = 7.5 min) but prolonged (>30 min) activation occurs for PLD2. Importantly, PA directly binds to actin-related protein 3 (Arp3) at EC50 = 22 nm, whereas control phosphatidylcholine did not bind. PA-activated Arp3 hastens actin nucleation with a kinetics of t½ = 3 min at 300 nm (compared with controls of no PA, t½ = 5 min). Thus, PLD and PA are intrinsic components of cell adhesion, which reinforce each other in a positive feedback loop and react from cues from their respective solid substrates. In nascent adhesion, PLD1 is key, whereas a sustained adhesion in mature or established focal points is dependent upon PLD2, PA, and Arp3. A prolonged adhesion could effectively counteract the reversible intrinsic nature of this cellular process and constitute a key player in chronic inflammation.

A prolonged adhesion could effectively counteract the reversible intrinsic nature of this cellular process and constitute a key player in chronic inflammation. Phosphatidic acid is a key lipid second messenger that mediates many crucial leukocyte-mediated cellular functions relevant to human health (embryological development, tissue repair, and immune surveillance/function) and pathology (vascular disease, chronic inflammatory diseases, and cancers), such as cell adhesion, migration, membrane remodeling, vesicular trafficking, and cell polarization (1.Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Cell migration: integrating signals from front to back.Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). Defining and characterizing the molecular targets of PA in dependent leukocyte signaling networks will help to explain its role in these important cell functions. Cell adhesion involves actin polymerization during embryogenesis, general maintenance of tissue architecture, inflammation, and tissue repair (2.Mahankali M. Peng H.J. Cox D. Gomez-Cambronero J. The mechanism of cell membrane ruffling relies on a phospholipase D2 (PLD2), Grb2 and Rac2 association.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3.Chimini G. Chavrier P. Function of Rho family proteins in actin dynamics during phagocytosis and engulfment.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E191-E196Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells can adhere to either other cells (e.g. leukocytes to endothelium) or to immobilized substrates, such as the extracellular matrix, and these processes are mediated by specific molecules on the cell membrane: cadherins and integrins, respectively. Integrins play a fundamental role when leukocytes exit the capillary bed and begin moving toward an invading pathogen. This leads to actin polymerization and the formation of lamellipodia and the initiation of membrane ruffling. Focal adhesions at the leading edges of lamellipodia give the cell enough traction to pull itself toward the chemoattractant.

The Arp2/3 (actin-related proteins 2/3) complex is critical for the actin cytoskeleton to both control nucleation of actin polymerization and to form networks of branched actin in response to a variety of cellular stimulants (6.Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. The interaction of Arp2/3 complex with actin: nucleation, high affinity pointed end capping, and formation of branching networks of filaments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3, and five additional subunits, ARPC1–5, form the Arp2/3 complex. Nucleation-promoting factors, such as the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) family (7.Burianek L.E. Soderling S.H. Under lock and key: Spatiotemporal regulation of WASP family proteins coordinates separate dynamic cellular processes.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 24: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), are responsible for signaling between Rho GTPase proteins (e.g. Cdc42, Rho, and Rac) and the Arp2/3 complex during actin polymerization (8.Hüfner K. Schell B. Aepfelbacher M. Linder S. The acidic regions of WASp and N-WASP can synergize with CDC42Hs and Rac1 to induce filopodia and lamellipodia.FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An activated WASp-Arp2/3 complex begins actin arborescent polymerization by creating multiple branch points that grow on the initial actin and form a functional actin cytoskeleton (9.Le Clainche C. Didry D. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Activation of Arp2/3 complex by Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein is linked to enhanced binding of ATP to Arp2.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46689-46692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This complex is involved in the establishment of cell polarity, found in macropinocytic cups in the leading edge of motile cells (lamellipodia) and in phagocytosis and wound healing (10.Magdalena J. Millard T.H. Etienne-Manneville S. Launay S. Warwick H.K. Machesky L.M. Involvement of the Arp2/3 complex and Scar2 in Golgi polarity in scratch wound models.Mol. Biol.

Although Arp2/3 plays a central role in cell migration, the importance of Arp2/3-specific activation in the initial steps of leukocyte adhesion to solid surfaces (e.g. capillary beds) has not been examined to date. We present here a new concept in cell signaling with PLD and its enzymatic product, PA, that binds to the cellular motility machinery (chiefly Arp3) and leads to actin polymerization. The two PLD mammalian isoforms (PLD1 and PLD2) play a concerted role in enhancing adhesion at differential temporal levels. This is important to establish a transient adhesion-depolymerization in the physiological context of inflammation. If this is deregulated, it could become a contributing cause of prolonged, chronic inflammation and its related diseases.

Sporulation-specific protein 20 (Spo20) is a yeast protein required for the fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane during yeast sporulation through its interactions with the SNARE complex (11.Neiman A.M.

Cloning of the PABD into the pEGFPC1 vector, leading to pEGFP-Spo20PABD-WT, for use in microscopy of mammalian cells has been described (15.Zeniou-Meyer M. Zabari N. Ashery U. Chasserot-Golaz S.

Murine RAW264.7/LR5 macrophages were from Dr. Dianne Cox (Albert Einstein School of Medicine Yeshiva University, New York) and were initially characterized by her (17.Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. Requirements for both Rac1 and Cdc42 in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis in leukocytes.J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and were maintained in low bicarbonate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator. Viability assays were routinely conducted with 0.4% trypan blue stain in cell preparations prior to all analyses and were >95%. Cells were ultimately resuspended in DMEM, 0.1% BSA at a concentration 1.5 × 106 cells/ml for use in chemotaxis assays. A Mirus-derived transfection protocol using the Ingenio reagent and electroporation was used to transfect plasmid DNAs into RAW264.7/LR5 mouse macrophages. When transfection was completed, cells were immediately plated in 6-well plates (non-tissue culture-treated plastic) in prewarmed RPMI-based medium supplemented with 20% FCS. Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 36 h to allow for maximum protein expression. Optimal protein expression was observed for 36–48 h post-transfection as verified using Western blot analyses of stimulated lysates. Cell adhesion experiments were performed on coverslips that were coated with collagen. For collagen coating, 10 µg/ml collagen in 20 mm acetic acid was prepared from the stock of 5 mg/ml collagen in 20 mm acetic acid. Coverslips were placed in 6-well plates, and 1 ml of collagen was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, after which collagen was aspirated, and the coverslips were gently rinsed with distilled water and air-dried. For the cell adhesion experiment, cells were harvested by trypsinization, counted, and resuspended in serum-free DMEM with 0.1% BSA and 3 nm MCP-1. Cells were plated on to the collagen-coated coverslips at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for specific time points. The cell suspension was aspirated, and 4% paraformaldehyde was added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature to fix the cells that were adhered. Cells were stained with hematoxylin. Alternatively, instead of using a chemoattractant, such as MCP-1, for cell stimulation during adhesion assays, a phospholipid was used, specifically 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). It has been demonstrated that the mitogenic properties of PA are dependent on both its chain length and saturation (18.Krabak M.J. Hui S.W. The mitogenic activities of phosphatidate are acyl-chain-length dependent and calcium independent in C3H/10T1/2 cells.Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Long saturated fatty acid-containing PA is more mitogenic than PA with short saturated fatty acids (18.Krabak M.J. Hui S.W. The mitogenic activities of phosphatidate are acyl-chain-length dependent and calcium independent in C3H/10T1/2 cells.Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, the acyl composition of PA determines its binding abilities to the protein phosphatase 2C, with DOPA being more effective (19.Zhang W. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Phospholipase D α 1-derived phosphatidic acid interacts with ABI1 phosphatase 2C and regulates abscisic acid signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9508-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). DOPA was initially prepared in 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA in PBS at an initial concentration of 1 mm and sonicated to obtain unilamellar vesicles (20.Yoon M.S. Sun Y. Arauz E. Jiang Y. Chen J.

Ultimately, cells were stimulated with 0, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 nm concentrations of DOPA in serum-free DMEM with 0.1% BSA for ∼15 min during adhesion for dose-dependent adhesion assays or with 300 nm DOPA in serum-free DMEM with 0.1% BSA for time-dependent adhesion assays. Immunocomplex samples were processed for PLD2 activity in PC8 liposomes and n-[3H]butanol beginning with the addition of the following reagents (final concentrations): 3.5 mm PC8 phospholipid, 45 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), and 1.0 µCi n-[3H]butanol in a liposome form, as indicated (23.Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Phospholipase D: molecular and cell biology of a novel gene family.Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with continuous shaking. The addition of 0.3 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (1:2) stopped the reactions. Lipids were then isolated and resolved by thin layer chromatography. The amount of [3H]PBut (phospho-butanol) that co-migrated with PBut standards was measured by scintillation spectrometry. RAW264.7 cells were transfected using plasmid DNA (if needed) and were plated onto coverslips placed into 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Eighteen h post-transfection, cells were fixed onto the coverslips using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked for 4 h at room temperature using 10% fetal calf serum in PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T), washed three times with PBS-T for 5 min each, and then probed overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit α-Myc-TRITC antibody (specific for Arp3) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) (Fig. 6) in blocking buffer. Coverslips were again washed three times with PBS and then incubated in a 1:200 dilution of phalloidin-AlexaFluor350 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were kept in the dark until needed and were viewed using a Nikon Upright Eclipse 50i tissue culture microscope; a Plan Fluor ×100/1.30 oil objective; and FITC, TRITC, or DAPI fluorescence filters. Photomicrographs were obtained using a Diagnostics Instruments Spot 6 digital camera and MetaVue software. For imaging of polymerized actin in macrophages (FIGURE 3., FIGURE 4.), coverslips were incubated in a 1:200 dilution of phalloidin-TRITC in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, washed as previously stated, and then incubated in a 1:2000 dilution of DAPI in PBS for 5 min at room temperature.FIGURE 4.Effect of PA on adhesion and actin nucleation. A, macrophage adhesion was performed in the presence of PLD-WT or the lipase-inactive mutant of PLD (PLD-KR). RAW264.7/LR5 macrophages were untreated or transfected with 2 µg of PLD1 or PLD2 plasmid DNAs and, 48 h post-transfection, were adhered to collagen-coated coverslips in the presence of 5 nm M-CSF for 45 min.

For detection of YFP-tagged PLD2 and polymerized actin (Fig. 3), we used an excitation filter of 490–510 nm, a dichroic mirror of 515 nm, and an emission filter of 520–550 nm (excitation/emission maxima of YFP are 512 and 529 nm, respectively). Actin was detected using phalloidin-AlexaFluor350 staining (as described above) viewed under a filter set with an excitation filter of 426–446 nm, a dichroic mirror of 455 nm, and an emission filter of 460–500 nm (excitation/emission maxima of CFP are 433 and 475 nm, respectively). In selected experiments, images of macrophages were acquired in a DeltaVision RT system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) fitted with CFP and YFP filter sets for multichannel imaging and high resolution ×60 oil immersion objective. After transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with special lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 µm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The lysates were sonicated, and the presence of overexpressed protein was confirmed by performing SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were treated with 1 µl of monoclonal antibody specific for the respective protein of interest (α-HA IgG for HA-tagged PLD2 or α-actin IgG for actin) and 10 µl of agarose beads (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. After incubation, the immunoprecipitates were washed with LiCl wash buffer (2.1% LiCl, 1.6% Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and NaCl wash buffer (0.6% NaCl, 0.16% Tris-HCl, 0.03% EDTA, pH 7.4), respectively, and sedimented at 12,000 × g for 1 min. The resulting pellets were then analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses onto PVDF membranes that were probed for reactivity with either rabbit α-HA IgG for HA-tagged PLD2 or rabbit α-actin IgG for actin and subsequent goat anti-rabbit HRP IgG antibodies (all from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Enhanced ECL reagents and autoradiography were used to detect immunoreactivities. The method for preparing and detecting protein-lipid binding has been described previously (24.Dowler S. Kular G. Alessi D.R. Protein lipid overlay assay.Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: pl6Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentrations of either DOPA or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipids from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) were spotted onto a PVDF membrane. DOPA or DOPC was dissolved in a 2.0:1.0:0.8 ratio solution of MeOH/CHCl3/H2O. Appropriate amounts of lipid ranging from 1 to 30 µg were spotted onto the membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight with a 3% fatty acid-free BSA solution. The membrane was then incubated overnight with recombinant Arp3 (50 nm). After protein incubation, the membrane was incubated overnight with a rabbit α-Arp3 IgG antibody. The membrane was then incubated with a goat anti-rabbit HRP IgG antibody, and the interaction was detected using chemiluminescence.

Ten µl of cell lysates were added to 85 µl of pyrene-labeled actin-containing buffer, which was purchased as a kit (BK003) from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). Ten µl of actin polymerization buffer was added to the reaction for a final total volume of 105 µl. Actin polymerization was measured for 12 min at 30-s intervals at an excitation of 350–360 nm with a bandwidth of 20 nm and an emission of 401–411 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm in a TECAN Safire2 at room temperature. An in vitro actin polymerization assay was performed as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton) except that the protein of interest (Arp3) was incubated with increasing concentrations of PA for 10 min prior to beginning the assay. The Arp3 recombinant protein was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The difference between means was assessed by the single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Probability of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. M-CSF at 3 nm concentration was found to be an excellent agonist for the study of RAW264.7/LR5 macrophage cell adhesion to collagen-coated microscope coverslips when compared with non-stimulated control cells (Fig. 1A). Macrophages that were fixed to the collagen-coated coverslips and subsequently stained with crystal violet were visualized using bright field microscopy favored a bell-shaped curve during adhesion that was both time- and agonist-dependent (Fig. 1, B and C). We found 30–60-min adhesion and 5 nm M-CSF to be optimal for chemoattractant-mediated adhesion of RAW264.7/LR5 macrophages alone in the absence of protein overexpression. Next, we measured the effect of agonist-mediated adhesion on the endogenous PLD activity of RAW264.7/LR5 macrophages and found that a variety of different macrophage agonists significantly increased PLD activity when compared with the mock-treated cells (Fig. 1D). Cells attached to several extracellular matrix proteins had increased PLD activity to varying degrees, with collagen being the highest (Fig. 1E). Because collagen coating yielded a greater increase in endogenous PLD activity of macrophages, we continued to use this matrix as our adhesion substrate in subsequent experiments. Having observed that adhesion promoted an enhancement in PLD activity, we found that small molecule inhibitors specific for PLD1, PLD2, or both isoforms were effective in abrogating adhesion of RAW264.7/LR5 macrophages to collagen-coated surfaces (Fig. 2A). The dual PLD1/2 inhibitor FIPI, the PLD1-specific inhibitor NCDOB, and the PLD2-specific inhibitor NFOT reduced cell adhesion to colla"
https://openalex.org/W1988885940,"Inflammatory response and articular destruction are common symptoms of osteoarthritis. Cysteine-rich 61 (CCN1 or Cyr61), a secreted protein from the CCN family, is associated with the extracellular matrix involved in many cellular activities like growth and differentiation. Yet the mechanism of CCN1 interacting with arthritic inflammatory response is unclear. This study finds CCN1 increasing expression of oncostatin m (OSM) in human osteoblastic cells. Pretreatment of αvβ3 monoclonal antibody and inhibitors of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and NF-κB inhibited CCN1-induced OSM expression in osteoblastic cells. Stimulation of cells with CCN1 increased phosphorylation of FAK, c-Src, PI3K, and NF-κB via αvβ3 receptor; CCN1 treatment of osteoblasts increased NF-κB-luciferase activity and p65 binding to NF-κB element on OSM promoter. Results indicate CCN1 heightening OSM expression via αvβ3 receptor, FAK, c-Src, PI3K, and NF-κB signal pathway in osteoblastic cells, suggesting CCN1 as a novel target in arthritis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2112256544,"It has been noted that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may be associated with certain disorders and medical procedures. However, most studies to date were done in Europe, and epidemiological data on the United States (US) population are scarce. Gender-based information is even rarer. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess the relative prevalence of each type of association based solely on literature data, because different comorbidities were reported by various groups from different countries using different patient populations and possibly different inclusion/exclusion criteria. In this study, we surveyed and analyzed a large adult BPPV population (n = 1,360 surveyed, 227 completed, most of which were recurrent BPPV cases) from Omaha, NE, US, and its vicinity, all diagnosed at Boys Town National Research Hospital (BTNRH) over the past decade using established and consistent diagnostic criteria. In addition, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients’ diagnostic records (n = 1,377, with 1,360 adults and 17 children). The following comorbidities were found to be significantly more prevalent in the BPPV population when compared to the age- and gender-matched general population: ear/hearing problems, head injury, thyroid problems, allergies, high cholesterol, headaches, and numbness/paralysis. There were gender differences in the comorbidities. In addition, familial predisposition was fairly common among the participants. Thus, the data confirm some previously reported comorbidities, identify new ones (hearing loss, thyroid problems, high cholesterol, and numbness/paralysis), and suggest possible predisposing and triggering factors and events for BPPV."
https://openalex.org/W2050030516,"Detailed knowledge of how the surface physical properties, such as mechanics, topography and texture influence axonal outgrowth and guidance is essential for understanding the processes that control neuron development, the formation of functional neuronal connections and nerve regeneration. Here we synthesize asymmetric surfaces with well-controlled topography and texture and perform a systematic experimental and theoretical investigation of axonal outgrowth on these substrates. We demonstrate unidirectional axonal bias imparted by the surface ratchet-based topography and quantify the topographical guidance cues that control neuronal growth. We describe the growth cone dynamics using a general stochastic model (Fokker-Planck formalism) and use this model to extract two key dynamical parameters: diffusion (cell motility) coefficient and asymmetric drift coefficient. The drift coefficient is identified with the torque caused by the asymmetric ratchet topography. We relate the observed directional bias in axonal outgrowth to cellular contact guidance behavior, which results in an increase in the cell-surface coupling with increased surface anisotropy. We also demonstrate that the disruption of cytoskeletal dynamics through application of Taxol (stabilizer of microtubules) and Blebbistatin (inhibitor of myosin II activity) greatly reduces the directional bias imparted by these asymmetric surfaces. These results provide new insight into the role played by topographical cues in neuronal growth and could lead to new methods for stimulating neuronal regeneration and the engineering of artificial neuronal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2009368899,"Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) has a non-clonal, epidemic population with a few widely distributed and frequently encountered sequence types (STs) called ‘high-risk clusters’. Clinical P. aeruginosa (clinPA) has been studied in all inhabited continents excepted in Africa, where a very few isolates have been analyzed. Here, we characterized a collection of clinPA isolates from four countries of West and Central Africa. Methodology 184 non-redundant isolates of clinPA from hospitals of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Central African Republic were genotyped by MLST. We assessed their resistance level to antibiotics by agar diffusion and identified the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) by sequencing. The population structure of the species was determined by a nucleotide-based analysis of the entire PA MLST database and further localized on the phylogenetic tree (i) the sequence types (STs) of the present collection, (ii) the STs by continents, (iii) ESBL- and MBL-producing STs from the MLST database. Principal Findings We found 80 distinct STs, of which 24 had no relationship with any known STs. ‘High-risk’ international clonal complexes (CC155, CC244, CC235) were frequently found in West and Central Africa. The five VIM-2-producing isolates belonged to CC233 and CC244. GES-1 and GES-9 enzymes were produced by one CC235 and one ST1469 isolate, respectively. We showed the spread of ‘high-risk’ international clonal complexes, often described as multidrug-resistant on other continents, with a fully susceptible phenotype. The MBL- and ESBL-producing STs were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree and our data suggest a poor association between a continent and a specific phylogroup. Conclusions ESBL- and MBL-encoding genes are borne by both successful international clonal complexes and distinct local STs in clinPA of West and Central Africa. Furthermore, our data suggest that the spread of a ST could be either due to its antibiotic resistance or to features independent from the resistance to antibiotics."

The pleiotropic Ranbp2 controls the expression of intrinsic and extrinsic pathological stressors impinging on cellular viability. However, the physiological targets and mechanisms controlled by Ranbp2 in tissue homeostasis, such as RPE, are ill defined. We show that mice, RPE-cre::Ranbp2−/−, with selective Ranbp2 ablation in RPE develop pigmentary changes, syncytia, hypoplasia, age-dependent centrifugal and non-apoptotic degeneration of the RPE, and secondary leakage of choriocapillaris. These manifestations are accompanied by the development of F-actin clouds, metalloproteinase-11 activation, deregulation of expression or subcellular localization of critical RPE proteins, atrophic cell extrusions into the subretinal space, and compensatory proliferation of peripheral RPE. To gain mechanistic insights into what Ranbp2 activities are vital to the RPE, we performed genetic complementation analyses of transgenic lines of bacterial artificial chromosomes of Ranbp2 harboring loss of function of selective Ranbp2 domains expressed in a Ranbp2−/− background. Among the transgenic lines produced, only TgRBD2/3*-HA::RPE-cre::Ranbp2−/−-expressing mutations, which selectively impair binding of RBD2/3 (Ran-binding domains 2 and 3) of Ranbp2 to Ran-GTP, recapitulate RPE degeneration, as observed with RPE-cre::Ranbp2−/−. By contrast, TgRBD2/3*-HA expression rescues the degeneration of cone photoreceptors lacking Ranbp2. The RPE of RPE-cre::Ranbp2−/− and TgRBD2/3*-HA::RPE-cre::Ranbp2−/− share proteostatic deregulation of Ran GTPase, serotransferrin, and γ-tubulin and suppression of light-evoked electrophysiological responses.

https://openalex.org/W2138923724,"Relationships between the neighborhood environment and children's physical activity have been well documented in Western countries but are less investigated in ultra-dense Asian cities. The aim of this study was to identify the environmental facilitators and barriers of physical activity behaviors among Hong Kong Chinese children using nominal group technique.Five nominal groups were conducted among 34 children aged 10-11 years from four types of neighborhoods varying in socio-economic status and walkability in Hong Kong. Environmental factors were generated by children in response to the question ""What neighborhood environments do you think would increase or decrease your willingness to do physical activity?"" Factors were prioritized in order of their importance to children's physical activity.Sixteen unique environmental factors, which were perceived as the most important to children's physical activity, were identified. Factors perceived as physical activity-facilitators included ""Sufficient lighting"", ""Bridge or tunnel"", ""Few cars on roads"", ""Convenient transportation"", ""Subway station"", ""Recreation grounds"", ""Shopping malls with air conditioning"", ""Fresh air"", ""Interesting animals"", and ""Perfume shop"". Factors perceived as physical activity-barriers included ""People who make me feel unsafe"", ""Crimes nearby"", ""Afraid of being taken or hurt at night"", ""Hard to find toilet in shopping mall"", ""Too much noise"", and ""Too many people in recreation grounds"".Specific physical activity-related environmental facilitators and barriers, which are unique in an ultra-dense city, were identified by Hong Kong children.

https://openalex.org/W2038855226,"Background Lower levels of cognitive function have been found to be associated with higher mortality in older people, particularly in dementia, but the association in people with other mental disorders is still inconclusive. Methods and Findings Data were analysed from a large mental health case register serving a geographic catchment of 1.23 million residents, and associations were investigated between cognitive function measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and survival in patients aged 65 years old and over. Cox regressions were carried out, adjusting for age, gender, psychiatric diagnosis, ethnicity, marital status, and area-level socioeconomic index. A total of 6,704 subjects were involved, including 3,368 of them having a dementia diagnosis and 3,336 of them with depression or other diagnoses. Descriptive outcomes by Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences between those with normal and impaired cognitive function (MMSE score<25), regardless of a dementia diagnosis. As a whole, the group with lower cognitive function had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.28, 1.58) regardless of diagnosis. An HR of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.28) per quintile increment of MMSE was also estimated after confounding control. A linear trend of MMSE in quintiles was observed for the subgroups of dementia and other non-dementia diagnoses (both p-values<0.001). However, a threshold effect of MMSE score under 20 was found for the specific diagnosis subgroups of depression. Conclusion Current study identified an association between cognitive impairment and increased mortality in older people using secondary mental health services regardless of a dementia diagnosis. Causal pathways between this exposure and outcome (for example, suboptimal healthcare) need further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2027689068,"Background A new component of the protein antioxidant capacity, designated Response Surplus (RS), was recently described. A major feature of this component is the close relationship between protein antioxidant capacity and molecular structure. Oxidative stress is associated with renal dysfunction in patients with renal failure, and plasma albumin is the target of massive oxidation in nephrotic syndrome and diabetic nephropathy. The aim of the present study was to explore the albumin redox state and the RS component of human albumin isolated from diabetic patients with progressive renal damage. Methods/Principal Findings Serum aliquots were collected and albumin isolated from 125 diabetic patients divided into 5 groups according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In addition to clinical and biochemical variables, the albumin redox state, including antioxidant capacity, thiol group content, and RS component, were evaluated. The albumin antioxidant capacity and thiol group content were reciprocally related to the RS component in association with GFR reduction. The GFR decline and RS component were significantly negatively correlated (R = –0.83, p<0.0001). Age, creatinine, thiol groups, and antioxidant capacity were also significantly related to the GFR decline (R = –0.47, p<0.001; R = –0.68, p<0.0001; R = 0.44, p<0.001; and R = 0.72, p<0.0001). Conclusion/Significance The response of human albumin to stress in relation to the progression of diabetic renal disease was evaluated. The findings confirm that the albumin molecular structure is closely related to its redox state, and is a key factor in the progression of diabetes nephropathy."

https://openalex.org/W2085475463,"Many blood biomarkers have a positive association with stroke outcome, but adding blood biomarkers to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) did not significantly improve its discriminatory ability. We investigated the association of the CHA2DS2-VASc score with unfavourable functional outcome (defined as a 30-day modified Rankin Scale [mRS] ≥ 3) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and examined whether the addition of blood biomarkers (troponin I [TnI], fibrinogen, C-reactive protein [CRP]) affects the model discriminatory ability.We conducted an observational single-centre study of consecutive patients with AIS. All patients were admitted to hospital within 24 hours from the neurological symptoms onset.Of 240 patients (mean age 70.0 ± 8.9 years), unfavourable 30-day outcome occurred in 92 (38.3%). Patients with mRS ≥ 3 were older and more likely to have atrial fibrillation or other comorbidities (all p<0.001). They had higher levels of CRP, fibrinogen, TnI and higher CHA2DS2-VASc and CHADS2 scores (all p<0.05). The adjusted CHA2DS2-VASc score had excellent predictive ability for poor stroke outcome (c-statistic 0.982;95%CI,0.964-1.000, p<0.001). Whilst CRP had the highest sensitivity (83.7%), cardiac TnI was the most specific (97.3%) for prediction of poor stroke outcome (cut-off: >0.09 µg/L). Compared with each of these biomarkers, CHA2DS2-VASc score had significantly better predictive ability for poor stroke outcome (c-statistic for CRP, Fibrinogen and TnI was 0.853;95%CI,0.802-0.895, 0.848;95%CI,0.796-0.891, and 0.792;95%CI,0.736-0.842, all p<0.001, respectively, versus 0.932;95%CI,0.892-0.960, p<0.001 for the CHA2DS2-VASc, all p for the comparisons<0.01). There was no significant difference in the predictive ability of the CHA2DS2-VASc score vs. combinations of the CHA2DS2-VASc and TnI or TnI, fibrinogen and CRP (z statistic 0.369, p = 0.7119; integrated discrimination index 0.00801 and 0.00172, respectively, both p>0.05).The CHA2DS2-VASc score alone reliably predicts 30-day unfavourable outcome of stroke.

https://openalex.org/W2039249121,"The Gram-negative bacterium Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of shigellosis, a diarrhoeal disease also known as bacillary dysentery. S. flexneri infects the colonic and rectal epithelia of its primate host and induces a cascade of inflammatory responses that culminates in the destruction of the host intestinal lining. Molecular characterization of host-pathogen interactions in this infection has been challenging due to the host specificity of S. flexneri strains, as it strictly infects humans and non-human primates. Recent studies have shown that S. flexneri infects the soil dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, however, the interactions between S. flexneri and C. elegans at the cellular level and the cause of nematode death are unknown. Here we attempt to gain insight into the complex host-pathogen interactions between S. flexneri and C. elegans. Using transmission electron microscopy, we show that live S. flexneri cells accumulate in the nematode intestinal lumen, produce outer membrane vesicles and invade nematode intestinal cells. Using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis we identified host proteins that are differentially expressed in response to S. flexneri infection. Four of the identified genes, aco-1, cct-2, daf-19 and hsp-60, were knocked down using RNAi and ACO-1, CCT-2 and DAF-19, which were identified as up-regulated in response to S. flexneri infection, were found to be involved in the infection process. aco-1 RNAi worms were more resistant to S. flexneri infection, suggesting S. flexneri-mediated disruption of host iron homeostasis. cct-2 and daf-19 RNAi worms were more susceptible to infection, suggesting that these genes are induced as a protective mechanism by C. elegans. These observations further our understanding of the processes involved in S. flexneri infection of C. elegans, which is immensely beneficial to the routine use of this new in vivo model to study S. flexneri pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2006424329,"Gender associated differences in vascular reactivity regulation might contribute to the low incidence of cardiovascular disease in women. Cardiovascular protection is suggested to depend on female sex hormones’ effects on endothelial function and vascular tone regulation. We tested the hypothesis that potassium (K+) channels and Na+K+-ATPase may be involved in the gender-based vascular reactivity differences. Aortic rings from female and male rats were used to examine the involvement of K+ channels and Na+K+-ATPase in vascular reactivity. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation was analyzed in the presence of L-NAME (100 µM) and the following K+ channels blockers: tetraethylammonium (TEA, 2 mM), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5 mM), iberiotoxin (IbTX, 30 nM), apamin (0.5 µM) and charybdotoxin (ChTX, 0.1 µM). The ACh-induced relaxation sensitivity was greater in the female group. After incubation with 4-AP the ACh-dependent relaxation was reduced in both groups. However, the dAUC was greater in males, suggesting that the voltage-dependent K+ channel (Kv) participates more in males. Inhibition of the three types of Ca2+-activated K+ channels induced a greater reduction in Rmax in females than in males. The functional activity of the Na+K+-ATPase was evaluated by KCl-induced relaxation after L-NAME and OUAincubation. OUA reduced K+-induced relaxation in female and male groups, however, it was greater in males, suggesting a greater Na+K+-ATPase functional activity. L-NAME reduced K+-induced relaxation only in the female group, suggesting that nitric oxide (NO) participates more in their functional Na+K+-ATPase activity. These results suggest that the K+ channels involved in the gender-based vascular relaxation differences are the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa) in females and Kv in males and in the K+-induced relaxation and the Na+K+-ATPase vascular functional activity is greater in males."
https://openalex.org/W2058971830,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease characterized by abnormal remodeling of small, peripheral pulmonary arteries. Germline mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) gene are a major risk factor for developing PAH. At present, the correlation between the BMPR2 mutation and the patient's prognosis remains controversial despite several investigations. In this study, we explored the functional effects of four BMPR2 mutations to dissect the functional significance of the BMPR2 gene defect. Cellular immunofluorescence assay of four mutants (Tyr67Cys, Thr268fs, Ser863Asn, and Gln433X) revealed that the BMPR2 protein containing Thr268fs, Ser863Asn, or Gln433X exhibited abnormal subcellular localization. The BrdU incorporation and TUNEL assay suggested that any of the BMPR2 mutations Thr268fs, Ser863Asn, or Gln433X could improve endothelial cell apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation. All of the four mutants could inhibit nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in HLMVE cells, and ET-1 levels increased in the cells transfected with mutant Ser863Asn. Our results will improve the understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlations and mechanisms associated with BMPR2 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2064559137,"Purpose Recently, a proof-of-concept study revealed the suitability of transcriptome analyses to obtain and assess changes in the abundance of transcripts in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos after exposure to organic sediment extracts. The present study investigated changes in the transcript abundance in zebrafish embryos exposed to whole sediment samples and corresponding organic extracts in order to identify the impact of different exposure pathways on sediment toxicity. Materials and Methods Danio rerio embryos were exposed to sublethal concentrations of three sediment samples from the Danube River, Germany. The sediment samples were investigated both as freeze-dried samples and as organic extracts. Silica dust and a process control of the extraction procedure were used as references. After exposure, mRNA was isolated and changes in profiles of gene expression levels were examined by an oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray results were compared with bioassays, chemical analysis of the sediments and profiles of gene expression levels induced by several single substances. Results and Discussion The microarray approach elucidated significant changes in the abundance of transcripts in exposed zebrafish embryos compared to the references. Generally, results could be related to Ah-receptor-mediated effects as confirmed by bioassays and chemical analysis of dioxin-like contaminants, as well as to exposure to stress-inducing compounds. Furthermore, the results indicated that mixtures of chemicals, as present in sediment and extract samples, result in complex changes of gene expression level profiles difficult to compare with profiles induced by single chemical substances. Specifically, patterns of transcript abundances were less influenced by the chemical composition at the sampling site compared t the method of exposure (sediment/extract). This effect might be related to different bioavailability of chemicals. Conclusions The apparent difference between the exposure scenarios is an important aspect that needs to be addressed when conducting analyses of alterations in the expression level of mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2070627586,"The assembly and release of retroviruses from the host cells requires a coordinated series of interactions between viral structural proteins and cellular trafficking pathways. Although a number of cellular factors involved in retrovirus assembly have been identified, it is likely that retroviruses utilize additional trafficking factors to expedite their assembly and budding that have not yet been defined. We performed a screen using an siRNA library targeting host membrane trafficking genes in order to identify new host factors that contribute to retrovirus assembly or release. We utilized two retroviruses that follow very distinct assembly pathways, HIV-1 and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) in order to identify host pathways that are generally applicable in retrovirus assembly versus those that are unique to HIV or M-PMV. Here we report the identification of 24 host proteins identified in the screen and subsequently validated in follow-up experiments as contributors to the assembly or release of both viruses. In addition to identifying a number of previously unsuspected individual trafficking factors, we noted multiple hits among proteins involved in modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, clathrin-mediated transport pathways, and phosphoinositide metabolism. Our study shows that distant genera of retroviruses share a number of common interaction strategies with host cell trafficking machinery, and identifies new cellular factors involved in the late stages of retroviral replication."

In contrast to the abundant resources available in the study of mice, few fluorescent protein-harboring porcine models are available for preclinical studies. In this paper, we report the successful generation and characterization of a transgenic DsRed-Monomer porcine model.The transgene comprised a CMV enhancer/chicken-beta actin promoter and DsRed monomeric cDNA. Transgenic pigs were produced by using pronuclear microinjection. PCR and Southern blot analyses were applied for identification of the transgene. Histology, blood examinations and computed tomography were performed to study the health conditions. The pig amniotic fluid progenitor/stem cells were also isolated to examine the existence of red fluorescence and differentiation ability.Transgenic pigs were successfully generated and transmitted to offspring at a germ-line transmission rate of 43.59% (17/39). Ubiquitous expression of red fluorescence was detected in the brain, eye, tongue, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, kidney, testis, and muscle; this was confirmed by histology and western blot analyses. In addition, we confirmed the differentiation potential of amniotic fluid progenitor stem cells isolated from the transgenic pig.This red fluorescent pig can serve as a host for other fluorescent-labeled cells in order to study cell-microenvironment interactions, and can provide optimal red-fluorescent-labeled cells and tissues for research in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and xenotransplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2019496001,"If two species exhibit different nonlinear responses to a single shared resource, and if each species modifies the resource dynamics such that this favors its competitor, they may stably coexist. This coexistence mechanism, known as relative nonlinearity of competition, is well understood theoretically, but less is known about its evolutionary properties and its prevalence in real communities. We address this challenge by using adaptive dynamics theory and individual-based simulations to compare community stabilization and evolutionary stability of species that coexist by relative nonlinearity. In our analysis, evolution operates on the species' density-compensation strategies, and we consider a trade-off between population growth rates at high and low resource availability. We confirm previous findings that, irrespective of the particular model of density dependence, there are many combinations of overcompensating and undercompensating density-compensation strategies that allow stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. However, our analysis also shows that most of these strategy combinations are not evolutionarily stable and will be outcompeted by an intermediate density-compensation strategy. Only very specific trade-offs lead to evolutionarily stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. As we find no reason why these particular trade-offs should be common in nature, we conclude that the sympatric evolution and evolutionary stability of relative nonlinearity, while possible in principle, seems rather unlikely. We speculate that this may, at least in part, explain why empirical demonstrations of this coexistence mechanism are rare, noting, however, that the difficulty to detect relative nonlinearity in the field [...]"
