https://openalex.org/W3038014648,"Aims The objective of this study was therefore to analyze the effect of exceptionally stressful situations, such as the current health risk, on the cognitive and emotive state of the individual, that is, perceived threat and emotional state on affect and mood. Method This was a cross-sectional study with snowball sampling. The sample came to 1014 Spanish adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men). The Perception of Threat from COVID-19 questionnaire, the Affective Balance Scale and the Mood Evaluation Scale were used. Results The results showed that the perception of threat from COVID-19 was related positively to negative affect and emotional signs, that is, sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility. There was a direct positive effect of perceived threat from COVID-19 on sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility moods, while anxiety and anger-hostility had a direct positive effect on perception of threat from the virus. Thus, there was a circular relationship, in which perceived threat influenced the presence of negative mood, and negative mood, in turn, linked to emotions of irritation and agitation from a present situation, promoted the feeling of threat. Conclusions A negative affective balance increases both one’s perception of threat from COVID-19 and negative mood. Thus, knowing the emotional and cognitive effects on the population would enable measures to be put into service to facilitate their effective coping."

However, for use in devices, these structures usually must be transferred to insulating or semiconducting surfaces. Kolmer et al. synthesized precise graphene nanoribbons on the surface of rutile titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) that assisted the cyclode-hydrofluorination of specifically designed precursor molecules through a series of thermally triggered transformations. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy confirmed the formation of well-defined zigzag ends of the nanoribbons as well as their weak interaction with the substrate.

Minxha et al. used single-neuron recordings from patients to understand how the human brain retrieves memories on demand when needed for making a decision and how retrieved memories are dynamically routed in the brain from the temporal to the frontal lobe. When memory was not needed, only medial frontal cortex neural activity was correlated with the task. However, when outcome choices required memory retrieval, frontal cortex neurons were phase-locked to field potentials recorded in the medial temporal lobe. Therefore, depending on demands of the task, neurons in different regions can flexibly engage and disengage their activity patterns. Science , this issue p. eaba3313"
https://openalex.org/W3037169863,"Bacterial biofilms are one of the major issues in the treatment of chronic infections such as chronic wounds, where biofilms are typically polymicrobial. The synergy between species can occur during most polymicrobial infections, where antimicrobial resistance enhances as a result. Furthermore, self-produced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in biofilms results in a high tolerance to antibiotics that complicates wound healing. Since most antibiotics fail to remove biofilms in chronic infections, new therapeutic modalities may be required. Disruption of EPS is one of the effective approaches for biofilm eradication. Therefore, degradation of EPS using enzymes may result in improved chronic wounds healing. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of trypsin, β-glucosidase, and DNase I enzymes on the degradation of dual-species biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus in a wound-like medium. These species are the two most common bacteria associated with biofilm formation in chronic wounds. Moreover, the reduction of minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of meropenem and amikacin was evaluated when combined with enzymes. The minimum effective concentrations of trypsin, β-glucosidase, and DNase I enzymes to degrade biofilms were 1 μg/ml, 8 U/ml, and 150 U/ml, respectively. Combination of 0.15 μg/ml trypsin and 50 U/ml DNase I had a significant effect on S. aureus-P. aeruginosa biofilms which resulted in the dispersal and dissolution of all biofilms. In the presence of the enzymatic mixture, MBECs of antibiotics showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05), at least 2.5 fold. We found that trypsin/DNase I mixture can be used as an anti-biofilm agent against dual-species biofilms of S. aureus-P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W3037177775,"Guiding regeneration Many adult organisms can regenerate neural circuits after injury. However, it is not clear which guidance mechanisms operate to promote axon path finding in the adult. Scimone et al. addressed this question by investigating regeneration of the planarian visual system (see the Perspective by Roberts-Galbraith). Distinct muscle cell populations were found in close association with photoreceptor axons that, together with a neuron class, facilitated visual system assembly after diverse injuries or eye transplantations. These cells exhibited features similar to embryonic guidepost cells and were specified independently of eyes in precise locations by the action of adult positional information cues. Absence of these guidepost-like cells was associated with defective neuronal wiring in regeneration. Science , this issue p. eaba3203 ; see also p. 1428"
https://openalex.org/W3037174362,"The recovery and analysis of ancient DNA and protein from archaeological bone is time-consuming and expensive to carry out, while it involves the partial or complete destruction of valuable or rare specimens. The fields of palaeogenetic and palaeoproteomic research would benefit greatly from techniques that can assess the molecular quality prior to sampling. To be relevant, such screening methods should be effective, minimally-destructive, and rapid. This study reports results based on spectroscopic (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance [FTIR-ATR]; n = 266), palaeoproteomic (collagen content; n = 226), and palaeogenetic (endogenous DNA content; n = 88) techniques. We establish thresholds for three different FTIR indices, a) the infrared splitting factor [IRSF] that assesses relative changes in bioapatite crystals’ size and homogeneity; b) the carbonate-to-phosphate [C/P] ratio as a relative measure of carbonate content in bioapatite crystals; and c) the amide-to-phosphate ratio [Am/P] for assessing the relative organic content preserved in bone. These thresholds are both extremely reliable and easy to apply for the successful and rapid distinction between well- and poorly-preserved specimens. This is a milestone for choosing appropriate samples prior to genomic and collagen analyses, with important implications for biomolecular archaeology and palaeontology."
https://openalex.org/W3037339936,"Objectives Early hospital readmissions or deaths are key healthcare quality measures in pay-for-performance programs. Predictive models could identify patients at higher risk of readmission or death and target interventions. However, existing models usually do not incorporate social determinants of health (SDH) information, although this information is of great importance to address health disparities related to social risk factors. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of social determinants of health on predictive models for potentially avoidable 30-day readmission. Methods We extracted electronic health record data for 19,941 hospital admissions between January 2015 and November 2017 at an academic medical center in New York City. We applied the Simplified HOSPITAL score model to predict potentially avoidable 30-day readmission or death and examined if incorporating individual- and community-level SDH could improve the prediction using cross-validation. We calculated the C-statistic for discrimination, Brier score for accuracy, and Hosmer–Lemeshow test for calibration for each model using logistic regression. Analysis was conducted for all patients and three subgroups that may be disproportionately affected by social risk factors, namely Medicaid patients, patients who are 65 or older, and obese patients. Results The Simplified HOSPITAL score model achieved similar performance in our sample compared to previous studies. Adding SDH did not improve the prediction among all patients. However, adding individual- and community-level SDH at the US census tract level significantly improved the prediction for all three subgroups. Specifically, C-statistics improved from 0.70 to 0.73 for Medicaid patients, from 0.66 to 0.68 for patients 65 or older, and from 0.70 to 0.73 for obese patients. Conclusions Patients from certain subgroups may be more likely to be affected by social risk factors. Incorporating SDH into predictive models may be helpful to identify these patients and reduce health disparities associated with vulnerable social conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3037095441,"Adapted to the task at hand RNA-based catalysts perform fundamental tasks in cellular RNA metabolism, especially in eukaryotes, where RNAs are cut by specialized ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) as part of ribosome assembly or messenger RNA regulation or splicing. Both RNA and protein components play a role in shaping how these large catalytic complexes interact with their RNA substrates. Lan et al. determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of a yeast RNP called ribonuclease MRP both alone and bound to a small RNA substrate. Comparison with the related ribonuclease P revealed differences in both protein and RNA components that enable ribonuclease MRP to recognize substrates with a specific sequence motif, rather than purely recognizing RNA structure as ribonuclease P does. These structures aid in considering how RNPs evolved and why they remain central to eukaryotic RNA processing. Science , this issue p. 656"
https://openalex.org/W3037536273,"Background Ethiopia has shown incredible success in malaria morbidity, mortality, and control. Community empowerment is a milestone to meet the ambitious plans of eliminating malaria by 2030. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate school-based malaria social behavior change communication (SBCC) in terms of community message exposure, acceptance, knowledge, and practices. Methods A community-based pre-posttest study was conducted in five districts of the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. 762 and 759 households were sampled for baseline and end-line, respectively. The intervention engaged students from primary schools on participatory peer education within small groups, followed by exposing parents with malaria messages aimed to influencing ideation and preventive practices. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Proportion/mean differences were computed to compare both surveys on exposure, knowledge, perceptions, and practices at p <0.05. Finally, a regression analysis was conducted between key changes and school-based exposure. Results The study revealed a sharp increase in exposure to malaria messages with effect size (ES) of 65.7%, p <0.001. School specific exposure has grown to 57.8% (ES = 44.5%). Comprehensive knowledge about malaria increased to 39.1% (ES = 14.8%). Identifying mosquito bites as a cause of malaria was increased by ES = 20.8%. A slight reduction in risk perception (ES = 3.3%) and attitude (ES = 3.8%) and a higher rise in self-efficacy (ES = 8.5%) were observed. Community message acceptance in favor of malaria danger control was significantly improved by 10% i.e. an increase in rational decision making to uptake preventive practices. Consistently, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) usage was improved to 63.0% (ES = 25.8%). Giving priority to use ITNs for under five years old children and pregnant women grew by 16.3% and 24.8%, respectively. Significant improvements were observed in treatment-seeking for fever (ES = 16.3%) and early treatment-seeking (ES = 15.5%). Not painting or plastering walls 6 months within spraying changed by ES = 61%. No significant change was observed in drug adherence. The school-based content intensity of exposure had effects on comprehensive knowledge, message acceptance, and ITN utilization. Conclusions Engaging school-aged children effectively advances community exposure, perception, and behaviors. We recommend the inclusion of school-based SBCC in the national malaria control programs."
https://openalex.org/W3037841108,"We estimated the risk of selecting for herbicide resistance in 101 weed species known to occur in wheat and barley crops on farms in New Zealand. A protocol was used that accounts for both the risk that different herbicides will select for resistance and each weed’s propensity to develop herbicide resistance based on the number of cases worldwide. To provide context we documented current herbicide use patterns. Most weeds (55) were low-risk, 30 were medium-risk and 16 high-risk. The top ten scored weeds were Echinochloa crus-galli, Poa annua, Lolium multiflorum, Erigeron sumatrensis, Raphanus raphanistrum, Lolium perenne, Erigeron bonariensis, Avena fatua, Avena sterilis and Digitaria sanguinalis. Seven out of ten high-risk weeds were grasses. The most used herbicides were synthetic auxins, an enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase inhibitor, acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors, and long-chain fatty acid inhibitors. ALS-inhibitors were assessed as posing the greatest risk for more species than other modes-of-action. Despite pre-emergence herbicides being known to delay resistance, New Zealand farmers only applied flufenacet and terbuthlazine with high frequency. Based on our analysis, surveys for herbicide-resistant species should focus on the high-risk species we identified. Farmer extension efforts in New Zealand should address resistance evolution in cropping weeds."

Stem bark of F. krishnae was sequentially extracted with hexane, methanol and water, and these extracts were tested for their antihyperglyceamic activity by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in overnight fasted glucose loaded normal rats. Hexane extract showed significant glucose lowering activity in OGTT, and the triterpene alcohols (cycloartenol+24-methylenecycloartanol) (CA+24-MCA) were isolated together from it by activity guided isolation and characterized by NMR and mass spectroscopy. The ratio of the chemical constituents CA and 24-MCA in (CA+24-MCA) was determined as 2.27:1.00 by chemical derivatization and gas chromatographic quantification. (CA+24-MCA) in high fat diet-streptozotocin induced type II diabetic rats showed significant antidiabetes activity at 1 mg/kg and ameliorated derailed blood glucose and other serum biochemical parameters. Cytoprotective activity of (CA+24-MCA) from glucose toxicity was evaluated in cultured RIN-5F cells by MTT assay and fluorescent microscopy. (CA+24-MCA) in in vitro studies showed enhanced cell viability in RIN-5F cells and significant protection of beta cells from glucose toxicity. Both in in vivo and in vitro studies (CA+24-MCA) showed enhancement in insulin release from the beta cells. In short term toxicity studies in mice (CA+24-MCA) did not show any conspicuous toxic symptoms. The combination of the phytosterols (CA+24-MCA) obtained through activity guided isolation of the stem bark of F. krishnae showed significant activity, and therefore is a promising candidate for new generation antidiabetes drug development."
https://openalex.org/W3037501372,"Previous research regarding Holstein cows has mainly focused on increasing milk yield. However, in order to maximize the economical profits of Holstein cattle farming, it is necessary to fully take advantage of Holstein bulls to produce high-grade beef. The present study aims to investigate different transcriptomic profiling of Holstein bulls and steers, via high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The growth and beef quality traits of Holstein steers and bulls were characterized via assessment of weight, rib eye area, marbling score, shear force and intramuscular fat percentage of the longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle. The results indicated that castration improved the meat quality, yet reduced the meat yield. Subsequently, RNA-seq of the LL muscle from Holstein steers and bulls revealed a total of 56 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We performed the functional enrichment analysis in Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of the DEGs using GOseq R package software and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis using KOBAS tool. Through the integrated analysis of DEGs with reported QTLs and SNPs, seven promising candidate genes potentially affecting the beef quality of LL muscle following castration were discovered, including muscle structural protein coding genes (MYH1, MYH4, MYH10) and functional protein coding genes (GADL1, CYP2R1, EEPD1, SHISA3). Among them, MYH10, GADL1, CYP2R1, EEPD1 and SHISA3 were novel candidate genes associated with beef quality traits. Notably, EEPD1 was associated with both meat quality and reproduction traits, thus indicating its overlapping role in responding to hormone change, and subsequently inducing beef quality improvement. Our findings provide a complete dataset of gene expression profile of LL in Holstein bulls and steers, and will aid in understanding how castration influence meat yield and quality."
https://openalex.org/W3037646282,"Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease lacking known molecular drivers and effective targeted therapies. Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for TNBCs, which have significantly poorer survival rates compared to other breast cancer subtypes. In addition to changes within the coding genome, aberrant enhancer activity is a well-established contributor to tumorigenesis. Here we use H3K27Ac chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map the active cis-regulatory landscape in TNBC. We identify distinct disease subtypes associated with specific enhancer activity, and over 2,500 unique superenhancers acquired by tumor cells but absent from normal breast tissue. To identify potential actionable disease drivers, we probed the dependency on genes that associate with tumor-specific enhancers by CRISPR screening. In this way we identify a number of tumor-specific dependencies, including a previously uncharacterized dependency on the TGFβ pseudo-receptor BAMBI."
https://openalex.org/W3038011710,"Biogeographic regions are defined by taxa with similar distribution patterns. Flowering plants have been widely used to propose biogeographic regionalization schemes because of shared historical or ecological factors that determine their distribution. The Mexican Transition Zone represents the boundary between the Nearctic and Neotropical kingdoms; however, there is no general agreement about the limits and extent of this region. Despite the significance of its role in the history of Mexican biota, no study involving a set of relevant plant taxa validates the magnitude of the Mexican Transition Zone. This work attempts to determine the proportion of flowering plant families and genera that characterize the biogeographic kingdoms and the Mexican Transition Zone. Through identification of distinctive genera it is shown that the Mexican Transition Zone includes the mountains of Mexico, from Oaxaca northwards. The results provide a broad view of the distribution patterns of the flora of Mexico and allow the evaluation of relationships and floristic affinities."
https://openalex.org/W3038050924,"Background Little is known about violence against HIV-positive adolescents and young adults (AYA) in sub-Saharan Africa. This analysis examines experiences of violence victimization, and the perpetrators of this violence, among AYA living with HIV, aged 15–24 years, in Zambia. Methods We analyzed baseline data from 272 AYA (60.1% female, 71.0% perinatally infected) enrolled in Project YES! (Youth Engaging for Success), a randomized controlled trial conducted in four HIV clinics in Ndola, Zambia. Violence measures were adapted from the ICAST-C and the WHO Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence. Youth could report up to 12 perpetrator types for past-year experiences of violence. We estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of physical violence, psychological abuse, and forced sex, disaggregated by sex and age group. Estimates were weighted using sex and age data from the 2013–14 Zambian Demographic and Health Survey to be representative of HIV-positive AYA in Zambia. Results Estimated lifetime prevalence of any violence victimization was 78.2%. Past-year prevalence was 72.0% among males and 74.5% among females. Almost half of AYA (46.1%) had ever experienced polyvictimization (2+ types of violence). Psychological abuse was most common (70.4% lifetime, 65.3% past-year), followed by physical violence (50.8% lifetime, 44.7% past-year) and forced sex (10.4% lifetime, 4.7% past-year). Among past-year victims, males experienced more violence than females from a friend/peer (74.3% vs. 45.1%, p<0.001); females experienced more violence than males from a romantic partner (33.3% vs. 5.0%, p<0.001), parent/caregiver (32.4% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.02), and stranger (19.7% vs. 5.2%, p<0.001). Conclusion The widespread and overlapping prevalence of multiple types of violence highlights the critical need for prevention and response efforts that are tailored to youths’ sex and the perpetrator type. Future research should explore violence victimization and HIV outcomes, and the measurement of psychological abuse and sexual violence, among HIV-positive AYA in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3037319793,"Machine learning (ML) is able to extract patterns and develop algorithms to construct data-driven models. We use ML models to gain insight into the relative importance of variables to predict obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) using the Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography for Selective Cardiac Catheterization (CONSERVE) study, as well as to compare prediction of obstructive CAD to the CAD consortium clinical score (CAD2). We further perform ML analysis to gain insight into the role of imaging and clinical variables for revascularization.For prediction of obstructive CAD, the entire ICA arm of the study, comprising 719 patients was used. For revascularization, 1,028 patients were randomized to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) or coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). Data was randomly split into 80% training 20% test sets for building and validation. Models used extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).Mean age was 60.6 ± 11.5 years and 64.3% were female. For the prediction of obstructive CAD, the AUC was significantly higher for ML at 0.779 (95% CI: 0.672-0.886) than for CAD2 (0.696 [95% CI: 0.594-0.798]) (P = 0.01). BMI, age, and angina severity were the most important variables. For revascularization, the model obtained an overall area under the receiver-operation curve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI = 0.933-0.983). Performance did not differ whether the imaging parameters used were from ICA (AUC 0.947, 95% CI = 0.903-0.990) or CCTA (AUC 0.941, 95% CI = 0.895-0.988) (P = 0.90). The ML model obtained sensitivity and specificity of 89.2% and 92.9%, respectively. Number of vessels with ≥70% stenosis, maximum segment stenosis severity (SSS) and body mass index (BMI) were the most important variables. Exclusion of imaging variables resulted in performance deterioration, with an AUC of 0.705 (95% CI 0.614-0.795) (P <0.0001).For obstructive CAD, the ML model outperformed CAD2. BMI is an important variable, although currently not included in most scores. In this ML model, imaging variables were most associated with revascularization. Imaging modality did not influence model performance. Removal of imaging variables reduced model performance."
https://openalex.org/W3038123258,"Within the southern California Current ecosystem there are two well-documented breaks in marine community structure at Point Conception and Punta Eugenia. We explored the presence of similar breaks in a diverse zooplankton community through metabarcoding of mixed net tow tissue samples collected during an expedition from Monterey to Baja California in February of 2012. We recovered a high diversity of species as well as patterns of species presence that align with their previously documented ranges in this region. We found a clear break at Punta Eugenia in overall zooplankton community structure, while Point Conception was weakly linked to changes in community structure. We analyzed this dataset through two parallel bioinformatic pipelines to examine the robustness of these results. Our overall conclusions were consistent across both pipelines, however there were differences in species detection. This study illustrates the utility of metabarcoding analysis on mixed tissue samples for recovering known patterns of diversity, as well as allowing elucidation of broad patterns of community differentiation across many groups of organisms."

https://openalex.org/W3037111714,"Programmed axonal degeneration, also known as Wallerian degeneration, occurs in immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis and the animal model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Sterile alpha and TIR domain containing protein 1 (SARM1) functions to promote programmed axonal degeneration. To test the hypothesis that loss of SARM1 will reduce axonal degeneration in immune-mediated CNS inflammatory disorders, the course and pathology of EAE was compared in Sarm1 knockout mice and wild type littermates. The clinical course of EAE was similar in Sarm1 knockout and wild type. Analysis of EAE in mice expressing neuronal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) showed significantly less axonal degeneration in Sarm1 knockout mice compared to wild type littermates at 14 days post-induction of EAE. At 21 days post-induction, however, difference in axonal degeneration was not significant. At 42 days post-induction, Sarm1 knockout mice were indistinguishable from wild type with respect to markers of axonal injury, and were similar with respect to axonal density in the lumbar cords. There was no significant change in peripheral immune activation or CNS inflammatory cell infiltration associated with EAE in Sarm1 knockout mice. In conclusion, Sarm1 deletion delayed axonal degeneration early in the course of CNS inflammation, but did not confer long-term protection from axonal degeneration in an animal model of immune-mediated CNS inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3037737059,"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Obesity-related metabolic disorders including dyslipidemia cause impaired collateralization under ischemic conditions, thereby resulting in exacerbated cardiovascular dysfunction. Pemafibrate is a novel selective PPARα modulator, which has been reported to improve atherogenic dyslipidemia, in particular, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterol. Here, we investigated whether pemafibrate modulates the revascularization process in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia.Male wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to two groups, normal diet or pemafibrate admixture diet from the ages of 6 weeks. After 4 weeks, mice were subjected to unilateral hindlimb surgery to remove the left femoral artery and vein. Pemafibrate treatment enhanced blood flow recovery and capillary formation in ischemic limbs of mice, which was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with pemafibrate resulted in increased network formation and migratory activity, which were blocked by pretreatment with the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Pemafibrate treatment also increased plasma levels of the PPARα-regulated gene, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 in WT mice. Systemic administration of adenoviral vectors expressing FGF21 (Ad-FGF21) to WT mice enhanced blood flow recovery, capillary density and eNOS phosphorylation in ischemic limbs. Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with FGF21 protein led to increases in endothelial cell network formation and migration, which were canceled by pretreatment with L-NAME. Furthermore, administration of pemafibrate or Ad-FGF21 had no effects on blood flow in ischemic limbs in eNOS-deficient mice.These data suggest that pemafibrate can promote revascularization in response to ischemia, at least in part, through direct and FGF21-mediated modulation of endothelial cell function. Thus, pemafibrate could be a potentially beneficial drug for ischemic vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3037013688,"Osteoarthritis is a common cause of pain and economic loss in both humans and horses. The horse is recognized as a suitable model for human osteoarthritis, because the thickness, structure, and mechanical properties of equine articular cartilage are highly comparable to those of humans. Although a number of equine experimental osteoarthritis models have been described in the literature, these cases generally involve the induction of osteoarthritis in just one joint of each animal. This approach necessitates the involvement of large numbers of horses to obtain reliable data and thus limits the use of this animal model, for both economic and ethical reasons. This study adapts an established equine model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis to induce osteoarthritis-associated lesions in all 4 fetlock joints of the same horse in order to reduce the number of animals involved and avoid individual variability, thus obtaining a more reliable method to evaluate treatment efficacy in future studies. The objectives are to assess the feasibility of the procedure, evaluate variability of the lesions according to interindividual and operated-limb position and describe the spontaneous evolution of osteoarthritis-associated pathological changes over a twelve-week period. The procedure was well tolerated by all 8 experimental horses and successfully induced mild osteoarthritis-associated changes in the four fetlock joints of each horse. Observations were carried out using clinical, radiographic, ultrasonographic, and magnetic resonance imaging methods as well as biochemical analyses of synovial fluid and postmortem microscopic and macroscopic evaluations of the joints. No significant differences were found in the progression of osteoarthritis-associated changes between horses or between the different limbs, with the exception of higher synovial effusion in hind fetlocks compared to front fetlocks and higher radiographic scores for left fetlocks compared to the right. This model thus appears to be a reliable means to evaluate the efficacy of new treatments in horses, and may be of interest for translational studies in human medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3036998242,"The 'Fuji' line includes many varieties with a similar genetic background and consistent inducement factors with epigenetic occurrence, thus it may be considered an ideal candidate for epigenetic research. In this study, 91 bud mutations of 'Fuji' apple were used as the test materials. Using the genetic variation within 'Fuji' as the control, the characteristics of epigenetic variation at different levels in both varieties and mutant groups were examined. The results showed that: (1) the global genomic DNA methylation level of the 91 bud mutants of 'Fuji' ranged from 29.120%-45.084%, with an average of 35.910%. Internal cytosine methylation was the main DNA methylation pattern. Regarding the variation of methylation patterns of 'Fuji' mutants, the vast majority of loci maintained the original methylation pattern existed in 'Fuji'. CHG methylation variation was the main type of variation; (2) the variation in methylation patterns between the mutant groups was greater than that of methylation levels. Among these patterns, the variation in CHG methylation patterns (including CHG hypermethylation and CHG demethylation) was expected to be dominant. The observed variation in methylation levels was more important in the Color mutant group; however, the variation in methylation patterns was more obvious in both the early maturation and Spur mutant groups. Moreover, the range of variation in the Early-maturation group was much wider than that in the Spur mutant group; (3) epigenetic diversity and genetic diversity were both low between the mutant groups. In the 'Fuji' mutant groups, there was few correlation between genetic and epigenetic variation, and epigenetic differentiation resulted in more loci with moderate or greater differentiation; (4) the purifying selection seemed to play a major role in the differentiation of different groups of 'Fuji' mutants (65.618%), but epigenetic diversity selection still occurred at nearly 35% of loci. Sixteen epigenetic outlier loci were detected."

In recent years a potential role of HPV in colorectal cancer (CRC) has been suggested.To investigate the presence of HPV in colorectal carcinomas and to study the role of p16INK4a as a marker of transcriptionally active HPV infection. In addition, to investigate the correlation between these findings and the CRC prognostic factors.Case control study with 92 cases of colorectal cancers, 75 controls of normal tissue adjacent to the tumor, and 30 controls of precursor lesions, including polyps and colorectal adenomas. Paraffinized samples were used, HPV detection and genotyping were performed by PCR and reverse hybridization by using the INNO LIPA kit, with SPF10 plus primers. The expression of the p16INK4a protein was investigated using immunohistochemistry. Data analysis was performed using descriptive, univariate statistics and survival curves were calculated by using the Kaplan Meier and log-rank method.HPV was detected in 13% of the cases and the most prevalent genotype was HPV 16. HPV DNA was not detected in either control groups. The high expression of p16INK4a was observed in 30% of the cases, but it was not associated to the presence of HPV. The overall survival was 53.3% and was influenced by prognostic factors such as later stage, lymph node and distant metastasis.Based on these results, HPV is unlikely to be involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and p16INK4a expression is not a relevant marker of transcriptionally active HPV infection in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3037578266,"Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in infants and young children but uncommon and usually asymptomatic in adults. In the winter of 2017–2018, a large-scale outbreak of rotavirus in both children and adults was reported in Thailand. The current study focused on the prevalence, genotyping, and molecular characterization of rotavirus infections in Thai adults from July 2016 to December 2019. In 2,598 stool samples collected from adult residents of Bangkok (aged #x2265; 15 years) with acute gastroenteritis, rotavirus was detected via real-time RT-PCR analysis of the VP6 gene. G, P and I genotypes were determined by direct sequencing of VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes, respectively. Our results showed 8.7% (226/2,598) of stool samples were positive for rotavirus. The incidence of rotavirus was high during the winter season of 2017–2018 (17.7%) compared to another studied periods (4.5% between July 2016- October 2017 and 2.8% between March 2018- December 2019). Nucleotide sequencing of VP7 and VP4 revealed G3P[8] as the predominant strain (33.2%,75/226), followed by G9P[8] (17.3%,39/226), and G2P[4] (15.0%,34/226). Uncommon G and P combinations were additionally detected at low frequencies. VP6 sequencing was conducted to discriminate I genotype between the Wa and DS-1 genogroup. The unusual DS-1-like G3P[8] strain was most prevalent amomg rotavirus strains detected in this study (29.6%, 67/226), and the corresponding VP7 sequences showed high nucleotide identity with unusual DS-1-like globally circulating strains. Our study demonstrates that rotavirus outbreaks in adults are attributable not only to high prevalence of RV infection but also the unusual DS-like genogroup. The collective findings reinforce the importance of investigating rotavirus diagnosis in adults suffering from acute gastroenteritis and taking appropriate preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W3037609791,"Intensive pig management involves in a commercial setting the housing and implementation of certain procedures, such as castration and tail docking, which may be stressful for the animal. Good farming practices include the reduction of stress due to management processes, but assessing the level of stress perceived entirely through behavioural observations can be challenging. The monitoring stress-related physiological markers, like glucocorticoids (GC), can be an accurate alternative that would presumably be more objective. In order to avoid an additional stressor by taking blood, a non-invasive approach is advisable. We used an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test and the effect of transport to examine the suitability of different enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring adrenocortical function in domestic pigs using saliva and faeces as sample matrices. An assay measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) with a 3ß,11ß-diol group has proven suited to determine adrenocortical activity, showing an overall increase of 180% in fGCM concentrations related to ACTH administration and of 70% related to transport, respectively. A cortisol EIA was used to detect salivary glucocorticoid (sGC) concentrations, revealing a 1100% increase in sGC concentrations after ACTH administration. The stability of fGCM concentrations post-defecation was determined to assess possible changes in measured fGCM concentrations in unpreserved faecal material over time, with fGCM concentrations being relatively stable (maximal 12% change) under natural conditions for approximately two days after defecation. This implicates that untreated faecal material from pigs can be analysed for up to two days after collection without appreciable level of depreciation in fGCM concentrations. Being able to assess the physiological stress response of domestic pigs non-invasively can help to improve the well-being of commercially reared pigs."
https://openalex.org/W3037712450,"Patient satisfaction is a useful predictor of adherence and outcomes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) treatment. This study explored the satisfaction of Vietnamese CVDs inpatients and outpatients using a scale specifically designed for CVDs patients and examined the factors associated with satisfaction towards CVDs treatment services. Interviews of 600 patients at the Hanoi Heart Hospital were conducted. We developed a measurement scale for both inpatient and outpatient services. Multivariate Tobit regression was used to determine the associated factors with patient satisfaction. For inpatients, Cronbach’s alpha reported for the domains were in the range of 0.72–0.97, while for outpatients, Cronbach’s alpha was within 0.61–0.97. Overall, patients were more satisfied with inpatient services (Mean = 81.8, SD = 5.8) than outpatient services (Mean = 79.7, SD = 5.2, p<0.05). In inpatients, the highest complete satisfaction was in “Attitude of Nurse” item (42.0%), the highest satisfaction score was in “Care and treatment” domain (Mean = 85.6, SD = 9.7) and the lowest in “Hospital facilities” domain (Mean = 78.3; SD = 9.2). Among outpatients, the highest complete satisfaction was in “Attitude of physicians when examining, guiding and explaining to the patient” item (19.7%), the highest satisfaction score was in “Attitude of medical staff” domain (Mean = 82.8; SD = 7.9) and the lowest in “Waiting time” domain (Mean = 76.6; SD = 8.2). People not having health insurances had significantly higher scores in “Waiting time”, “Hospital facilities” and “Attitude of staff” domains (for outpatients) and in “Health service accessibility”, “Hospital facilities” domains (for inpatients) as well as higher total satisfaction score than those having health insurance. Findings discovered through the application of the newly developed instrument showed low satisfaction regarding hospital facilities for inpatients and waiting time for outpatients, suggesting renovation efforts, while inferiority regarding patient satisfaction of health insurance covered patients compared to those without implied policy reform possibility. Further enhancement and validation of the developed instrument was required."
https://openalex.org/W3037832667,"Purpose The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is increasingly used to characterize breast cancer. The peritumor/tumor ADC ratio is suggested to be a reliable and generally applicable index. However, its overall prognostication value remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between the peritumor/tumor ADC ratio and histopathological biomarkers and published prognostic tools in patients with invasive breast cancer. Materials and methods This prospective study included 88 lesions (five bilateral) in 83 patients with primary invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging. The lowest intratumoral mean ADC value on the slice with the largest tumor cross-sectional area was designated the tumor ADC, and the highest mean ADC value on the peritumoral breast parenchymal tissue adjacent to the tumor border was designated the peritumor ADC. The peritumor/tumor ADC ratio was then calculated. The tumor and peritumor ADC values and peritumor/tumor ADC ratios were compared with histopathological parameters using an unpaired t test, and their correlations with published prognostic tools were evaluated with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results The peritumor/tumor ADC ratio was significantly associated with tumor size (p<0.001), histological grade (p = 0.005), Ki-67 index (p = 0.006), axillary-lymph-node metastasis (p = 0.001), and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.006), but was not associated with estrogen receptor status (p = 0.931), progesterone receptor status (p = 0.160), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status (p = 0.259). The peritumor/tumor ADC ratio showed moderate positive correlations with the Nottingham Prognostic Index (r = 0.498, p<0.001) and mortality predicted using PREDICT (r = 0.436, p<0.001). Conclusion The peritumor/tumor ADC ratio was correlated with histopathological biomarkers in patients with invasive breast cancer, showed significant correlations with published prognostic indexes, and may provide an easily applicable imaging index for the preoperative prognostic evaluation of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3037889955,"Alternatives to antibiotics for prevention of respiratory tract infections in cattle are urgently needed given the increasing public and regulatory pressure to reduce overall antibiotic usage. Activation of local innate immune defenses in the upper respiratory tract is one strategy to induce non-specific protection against infection with the diverse array of viral and bacterial pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), while avoiding the use of antibiotics. Our prior studies in rodent models demonstrated that intranasal administration of liposome-TLR complexes (LTC) as a non-specific immune stimulant generated high levels of protection against lethal bacterial and viral pathogens. Therefore, we conducted studies to assess LTC induction of local immune responses and protective immunity to BRDC in cattle. In vitro, LTC were shown to activate peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cattle, which was associated with secretion of INFγ and IL-6. Macrophage activation with LTC triggered intracellular killing of Mannheimia hemolytica and several other bacterial pathogens. In studies in cattle, intranasal administration of LTC demonstrated dose-dependent activation of local innate immune responses in the nasopharynx, including recruitment of monocytes and prolonged upregulation (at least 2 weeks) of innate immune cytokine gene expression by nasopharyngeal mucosal cells. In a BRDC challenge study, intranasal administration of LTC prior to pathogen exposure resulted in significant reduction in both clinical signs of infection and disease-associated euthanasia rates. These findings indicate that intranasal administration of a non-specific innate immune stimulant can be an effective method of rapidly generating generalized protection from mixed viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W3037986757,"Cats positive effects on their owners’ physiological and psychological health, including improved mood and activation of the human prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus in the brain. However, the association between the health benefits provided by cat ownership and the characteristic behaviors and reactions of cats is unclear. We recruited 29 participants to measure human prefrontal cortex activity, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, during interactions with a cat. After the experiments, participants subjectively responded to a questionnaire regarding success rates for interactions with the cat, and completed the Self-assessment Manikin—a scale used to measure emotion. Interactions comprised eight types in four categories (touch, play, train, and feed). This study showed that interactions with a cat significantly activated the prefrontal cortex, regardless of interaction type. During training, the integral values of oxygenated hemoglobin in the left inferior frontal gyrus were the highest in all the interaction categories; however, success rates were lower than in the touch and feed interactions. Regarding the Self-assessment Manikin scores, all interaction categories showed a positive correlation between success rate and valence score, especially in the train and play interactions than in the touch and feed interactions. These results indicate that interactions with a cat activate the prefrontal cortex in humans, including the inferior frontal gyrus region. Moreover, cats’ autonomous behaviors and reactions positively influenced the participants. The characteristic temperament of cats may be a key factor influencing the health benefits of owning cats."
https://openalex.org/W3038005775,"Background Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) Ethiopia achieved significant declines in malaria mortality and incidence and has recently launched malaria elimination in selected low transmission settings. Successful malaria elimination calls for rapid and accurate diagnosis of cases so that the patients can promptly be treated before the occurrence of transmission. Therefore, this study assessed the competency of malaria microscopists using panal slides, and laboratory service availability and readiness in terms of supplies and equipments in malaria elimination targeted districts in Ethiopia. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to June 2018 in all hospitals, health centers and private clinics in 20 malaria elimination targeted districts, selected out of the 6 regional states in Ethiopia. All malaria microscopists available in the study health facilities during the study period were included in the study. Questionnaires were used for interviewing sociodemography of personnel and laboratory supplies. Per World Health Organization (WHO) criteria set for proficiency testing, 10 Giemsa stained malaria slide panels (8 positive low/high density pf/pv/Mixed and 2 negative slides) were administered to each study participant for performance assessment on malaria parasite detection, species identification and parasite count using light microscopy. The slide panels are PCR confirmed and WHO approved ones, which have been stored in the slide banks at the national reference laboratory in Ethiopian Public Health Institute. Result In this assessment, 17(16%) district hospitals, 71(67%) health centers (HCs) and 18(17%) private clinics (PCs) were included. Of the 18 PCs, only 10(55.6%) had license certificate. Of the study facilities, 91.5%(97) use light microscopy, 2.83%(3) use RDTs and 2.9%(3) use both microscopy and RDT to detect malaria. Accessible and appropriate storage of Giemsa was reported by 58.8%(10) hospitals, 81.7%(58) HCs & 72.2%(13) private clinics. Of the 1896 malaria positive & 474 negative slides administered to 237 study participants, 318(16.8%) slides reported falsely negative & 47(9.9%) reported falsely positive. The participants achieved “good” grade [Agreement(A): 84.6%, Kappa(K): 0.6] on parasite detection and “poor” agreement (A: 43.8%; K: 0.11) on every species identification. No or slight agreement seen on differentiation of P. falciparum from other species (A: 28.41%; K:0.29). Above 95%(201) of participants, did not count or used plus system of parasite estimation which is the least accurate and unreccomended method per WHO guideline. Conclusion In the current study, low performance of malaria microscopists particularly in species identification & poor to moderate capacity of laboratories observed. This is really a great obstacle to malaria elimination strategy of the country. Therefore, national malaria control and elimination program in collaboration with partners is supposed to provide comprehensive training for professionals giving laboratory service and to fulfill laboratory supplies to have the gold standard service."
https://openalex.org/W3038025153,"Manipulative strategies of ROS in cancer are often exhibited as changes in the redox and thiol ratio of the cells. Cellular responses to oxidative insults are generated in response to these changes which are triggered due to the rerouting of the metabolic framework to maintain survival under stress. However, mechanisms of these metabolic re-routing are not clearly understood and remained debatable. In the present work, we have designed a context-based dynamic metabolic model to establish that the coordinated functioning of glutathione peroxidase (GTHP), glutathione oxidoreductase (GTHO) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) is crucial in determining cancerous transformation, specifically in gliomas. Further, we propose that the puzzling duality of ROS (represented by changes in h2o2 in the present model) in exhibiting varying cellular fates can be determined by considering simultaneous changes in nadph/nadp+ and gsh/gssg that occur during the reprogramming of metabolic reactions. This will be helpful in determining the pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic fate of gliomas and can be useful in designing effective pro-oxidant and/or anti-oxidant therapeutic approaches against gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W3038039032,"The aim of this trial was to investigate whether a digital device that provides real-time visualized brushing instructions would contribute to the removal of dental plaque over usual brushing instructions.We conducted a single-center, parallel-group, stratified permuted block randomized control trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Eligibility criteria included people aged ≥ 18 years, and exclude people who met the following criteria: severely crowded teeth; using interdental cleaning implement; having external injury in the oral cavity, or stomatitis; having less than 20 teeth; using orthodontic apparatus; visited to a dental clinic; having the possibility of consulting a dental clinic; having a dental license; not owning a smartphone or tablet device; smoker; taken antibiotics; pregnant; an allergy to the staining fluid; and employee of Sunstar Inc. All participants received tooth brushing instructions using video materials and were randomly assigned to one of two groups for four weeks: (1) an intervention group who used the digital device, providing real-time visualized instructions by connection with a mobile application; and (2) a control group that used a digital device which only collected their brushing logs. The primary outcome was the change in 6-point method plaque control record (PCR) score of all teeth between baseline and week 4. The t-test was used to compare the two groups in accordance with intention-to-treat principles.Among 118 enrolled individuals, 112 participants were eligible for our analyses. The mean of PCR score at week 4 was 45.05% in the intervention group and 49.65% in the control group, and the change of PCR score from baseline was -20.46% in the intervention group and -15.77% in the control group (p = 0.088, 95% confidence interval -0.70-10.07).A digital device providing real-time visualized brushing instructions may be effective for the removal of dental plaque."
https://openalex.org/W3037796919,"Early prediction of in-hospital mortality can improve patient outcome. Current prediction models for in-hospital mortality focus mainly on specific pathologies. Structured pathology data is hospital-wide readily available and is primarily used for e.g. financing purposes. We aim to build a predictive model at admission using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes as predictors and investigate the effect of the self-evident DNR (""Do Not Resuscitate"") diagnosis codes and palliative care codes. We compare the models using ICD-10-CM codes with Risk of Mortality (RoM) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) as predictors using the Random Forests modeling approach. We use the Present on Admission flag to distinguish which diagnoses are present on admission. The study is performed in a single center (Ghent University Hospital) with the inclusion of 36 368 patients, all discharged in 2017. Our model at admission using ICD-10-CM codes (AUCROC = 0.9477) outperforms the model using RoM (AUCROC = 0.8797 and CCI (AUCROC = 0.7435). We confirmed that DNR and palliative care codes have a strong impact on the model resulting in a decrease of 7% for the ICD model (AUCROC = 0.8791) at admission. We therefore conclude that a model with a sufficient predictive performance can be derived from structured pathology data, and if real-time available, can serve as a prerequisite to develop a practical clinical decision support system for physicians."
https://openalex.org/W3038113110,"Approximately 30,000 patients with blunt cardiac trauma are recorded each year in the United States. Blunt cardiac injuries after trauma are associated with a longer hospital stay and a poor overall outcome. Organ damage after trauma is linked to increased systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns. However, the interplay between polytrauma and local cardiac injury is unclear. Additionally, the impact of surgical intervention on this process is currently unknown. This study aimed to determine local cardiac immunological and structural alterations after multiple trauma. Furthermore, the impact of the chosen fracture stabilization strategy (reamed versus non-reamed femoral nailing) on cardiac alterations was studied.15 male pigs were either exposed to multiple trauma (blunt chest trauma, laparotomy, liver laceration, femur fracture and haemorrhagic shock) or sham conditions. Blood samples as well as cardiac tissue were analysed 4 h and 6 h after trauma. Additionally, murine HL-1 cells were exposed to a defined polytrauma-cocktail, mimicking the pro-inflammatory conditions after multiple trauma in vitro.After multiple trauma, cardiac structural changes were observed in the left ventricle. More specifically, alterations in the alpha-actinin and desmin protein expression were found. Cardiac structural alterations were accompanied by enhanced local nitrosative stress, increased local inflammation and elevated systemic levels of the high-mobility group box 1 protein. Furthermore, cardiac alterations were observed predominantly in pigs that were treated by non-reamed intramedullary reaming. The polytrauma-cocktail impaired the viability of HL-1 cells in vitro, which was accompanied by a release of troponin I and HFABP.Multiple trauma induced cardiac structural alterations in vivo, which might contribute to the development of early myocardial damage (EMD). This study also revealed that reamed femoral nailing (reamed) is associated with more prominent immunological cardiac alterations compared to nailing without reaming (non-reamed). This suggests that the choice of the initial fracture treatment strategy might be crucial for the overall outcome as well as for any post-traumatic cardiac consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3037320882,"The recent ban of the antimicrobial compound triclosan from use in consumer soaps followed research that showcased the risk it poses to the environment and to human health. Triclosan has been found in human plasma, urine and milk, demonstrating that it is present in human tissues. Previous work has also demonstrated that consumption of triclosan disrupts the gut microbial community of mice and zebrafish. Due to the widespread use of triclosan and ubiquity in the environment, it is imperative to understand the impact this chemical has on the human body and its symbiotic resident microbes. To that end, this study is the first to explore how triclosan impacts the human gut microbial community in vitro both during and after treatment. Through our in vitro system simulating three regions of the human gut; the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon regions, we found that treatment with triclosan significantly impacted the community structure in terms of reduced population, diversity, and metabolite production, most notably in the ascending colon region. Given a 2 week recovery period, most of the population levels, community structure, and diversity levels were recovered for all colon regions. Our results demonstrate that the human gut microbial community diversity and population size is significantly impacted by triclosan at a high dose in vitro, and that the community is recoverable within this system."

https://openalex.org/W3037680564,"Strong early vigour plays a crucial role in wheat yield improvement by enhancing resource utilization efficiency. Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) combines the elite genes of tetraploid wheat with Aegilops tauschii and has been widely used in wheat genetic improvement for its abundant genetic variation. The two SHWs Syn79 and Syn80 were derived from the crossing of the same tetraploid wheat DOY1 with two different Ae. tauschii accessions, AT333 and AT428, respectively. The Syn80 possessed better early vigour traits than Syn79, theretically caused by their D genome from Ae. tauschii. To dissect their genetic basis in a hexaploid background, 203 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of Syn79 x Syn80 were developed to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for four early biomass related traits: plant height (PH), tiller number (TN), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and shoot dry weight (SDW) per plant, under five different environmental conditions. Determined from the data of SNP markers, two genome regions on 1DS and 7D were stably associated with the four early biomass related traits showing pleiotropic effects. Four stable QTLs QPh.saas-1DS, QTn.saas-1DS, QSfw.saas-1DS and QSdw.saas-1DS explaining 7.92, 15.34, 9.64 and 10.15% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, were clustered in the region of 1DS from AX-94812958 to AX-110910133. Meanwhile, QPh.saas-7D, QTn.saas-7D, QSfw.saas-7D and QSdw.saas-7D were flanked by AX-109917900 and AX-110605376 on 7D, explaining 16.12, 24.35, 15.25 and 13.37% of the phenotypic variation on average, respectively. Moreover, these genomic QTLs on 1DS and 7D enhancing biomass in the parent Syn80 were from Ae. tauschii AT428. These findings suggest that these two QTLs from Ae. tauschii can be expressed stably in a hexaploid background at the jointing stage and be used for wheat improvement."

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a nutrient-rich, food-based supplement given to Vietnamese rural women prior to and/or during pregnancy on the growth of their infants during first 24 months of life and to identify maternal and newborn factors associated with the infant’s growth. This prospective cohort study included 236 infants born to mothers who had received nutritional advice or a food supplement from pre-conception to term or from mid-gestation to term as part of a prior randomized controlled trial. Infant anthropometry and feeding information were monitored monthly and the infant weight for age Z-score (WAZ), length for age Z-score (LAZ), and weight for length Z-score (WLZ) were assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age using mixed-effects regression modeling. Compared to the non-supplemented mothers, infants born to mothers receiving food supplementation from mid-gestation to term had significantly higher WLZ only at 18 months (p = 0.03) and did not differ in other outcomes. Supplementation from pre-conception to term did not affect infant growth at any time point during the first 24 months. In the entire study cohort, maternal height and gestational weight gain were positively associated with the infant’s WAZ and LAZ from 6 to 24 months of age. Programs designed to improve gestational weight gain among women performing demanding physical work throughout a reproductive cycle may improve postnatal infant growth.

https://openalex.org/W3037646763,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients typically undergo surgical treatment as teenagers, follow-ups of >5 years are necessary to evaluate effects on peak pulmonary reserves. However, limited data is available regarding the long-term (>10 years) effects of surgical intervention on pulmonary function (PF) in patients with thoracic AIS.To provide long-term (>10 years) information on the PF after posterior spinal fusion for treating main thoracic AIS. We especially investigated whether surgical correction for AIS led to impairment of the PF.A total of 35 patients with main thoracic AIS treated with posterior spinal fusion were included. Radiographs and PF tests, which included measurements of absolute and percent-predicted values of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), were evaluated.Mean age at surgery was 14.9 years (12-19 years). Mean follow-up period was 15.1 years (10-24 years). Although the final postoperative FVC and FEV1 absolute values were higher than the preoperative values, the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.22 and p = 0.08, respectively). Percent-predicted FVC and FEV1 values between preoperative and final postoperative measurements were not statistically different (p = 0.63 and p = 0.29, respectively). However, for the patients who presented with pulmonary impairment preoperatively, both the FVC and FEV1 significantly increased at the final follow-up (p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively).Long-term results of AIS patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion in main thoracic curves demonstrated absolute and percent-predicted PF test values similar to preoperative measurements; thus, indicating that posterior spinal fusion did not decrease PF 15 years after the initial surgery. Instead, patients with severe preoperative pulmonary impairment might show some degree of improvement after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3037016392,"Background & aims The management of patients with refractory ascites (RA) is challenging, particularly at higher age. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established treatment for RA, but safety data in elderly patients are rare. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of TIPS in elderly patients with RA. Methods Overall, 160 consecutive cirrhotic patients receiving a TIPS for RA at Hannover Medical School between 2012 and 2018 were considered for this retrospective analysis. Periinterventional complications such as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) as well as survival were compared between patients <65 and ≥65 years. Propensity score matching was conducted to match elderly TIPS patients and patients treated with paracentesis. Results A number of 53 out of the 160 patients were ≥65 years (33%). Periinterventional course in those ≥65 years appeared to be slightly more complicated than in <65 years as reflected by a significantly longer hospital stay (p = 0.030) and more ACLF-episodes (21% vs. 9%; p = 0.044). 28-day mortality was similar between both groups (p = 0.350), whereas survival of the younger patients was significantly higher at 90 days (p = 0.029) and numerically higher at 1 year (p = 0.171). In the multivariate analysis age ≥65 years remained an independent predictor for 90-day mortality (HR: 2.58; p = 0.028), while it was not associated with 28-day and 1-year survival. Importantly, after matching for potential confounders 1-year survival was similar in elderly patients if treated with TIPS or paracentesis (p = 0.419). Conclusions TIPS placement in elderly patients with RA appears to be slightly more complicated compared to younger individuals, but overall feasible and at least not inferior to paracentesis."
https://openalex.org/W3037054969,"Phrenic nerve injury (PNI) remains one of the most frequent complications during cryoballoon-based pulmonary vein isolation (CB-PVI). Since its introduction in 2013, the use of compound motor action potential (CMAP) for the prevention of PNI during CB-PVI is increasing; however, systematic outcome data are sparse.The CMAP technique was applied in conjunction with abdominal palpation during pacing manoeuvres (10 mV, 2 ms) from the superior vena cava for 388 consecutive patients undergoing CB-PVI between January 2015 and May 2017 at our tertiary arrhythmia centre. Cryoablation was immediately terminated when CMAP amplitude was reduced by 30%.Reductions in CMAP amplitude were observed in 16 (4%) of 388 patients during isolation of the right veins. Of these, 11 (69%) patients did not manifest a reduction in diaphragmatic excursions. The drop in CMAP amplitude was observed in 10 (63%) patients during ablation of the right superior pulmonary veins (PVs) and in 7 (44%) patients during ablation of the right inferior PVs. Postprocedural persistent PNI was observed in three of four patients for a duration of 6 months, with one of these patients remaining symptomatic at the 24-month follow-up. One of the four patients was lost to long-term follow-up.All PNIs occurred during right-sided CB-PVI and were preceded by a reduction in CMAP amplitude. Thus, the standardized use of CMAP surveillance during CB-PVI is easily applicable, reliable and compared with other studies, results in a lower number of PNIs."
https://openalex.org/W3037059749,"Background Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal and child mortality worldwide. Maternal HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment (ART) increase the rate of preterm birth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, limiting progress in prediction, prevention and treatment. While overall γδ T cell levels remain constant, acute HIV infection is associated with a depletion of the Vδ2 subset and an increase in the Vδ1 subset, which do not return to baseline with ART. γδ T cells have also been implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes and we therefore investigated the potential association between maternal HIV infection, peripheral γδ T cell frequencies and preterm birth. Methods Study participants were HIV positive (n = 47) and HIV negative (n = 45) women enrolled in a prospective pregnancy cohort study at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. Women were enrolled in early pregnancy and gestational age was accurately determined by first trimester ultrasound scan. Peripheral blood samples were collected in each trimester and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated. Frequencies of γδ T cells, Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ γδ T cell subsets, and CCR6 chemokine receptor expression were determined by flow cytometry. Results Total γδ T cell levels were similar between HIV positive and HIV negative women throughout pregnancy. However, in each trimester maternal HIV infection was associated with reduced levels of the Vδ2+ subset and increased levels of the Vδ1+ subset, leading to a reversal of the Vδ1/Vδ2 ratio. Timing of ART initiation among HIV positive women did not affect levels of γδ T cells, the Vδ1+ and Vδ2+ subsets, or the Vδ1/Vδ2 ratio. Importantly, preterm birth was associated with lower total γδ T cell levels in early pregnancy and γδ T cell frequencies were lowest in HIV positive women who delivered preterm. Moreover, in the first trimester the proportion of Vδ1+ T cells that were CCR6+ was significantly reduced in HIV+ women and women who delivered preterm, resulting in the lowest proportion of CCR6+ Vδ1 T cells in HIV positive women who delivered preterm. Conclusions Our findings suggest that altered γδ T cell frequencies may link maternal HIV infection and preterm birth. γδ T cell frequencies in early pregnancy may serve as predictive biomarkers to identify women at risk of delivering preterm."
https://openalex.org/W3037595827,"Tracking the origin of propagating wave signals in an environment with complex reflective surfaces is, in its full generality, a nearly intractable problem which has engendered multiple domain-specific literatures. We posit that, if the environment and sensor geometries are fixed, machine learning algorithms can ""learn"" the acoustical geometry of the environment and accurately track signal origin. In this paper, we propose the first machine-learning-based approach to identifying the source locations of semi-stationary, tonal, dolphin-whistle-like sounds in a highly reverberant space, specifically a half-cylindrical dolphin pool. Our algorithm works by supplying a learning network with an overabundance of location ""clues"", which are then selected under supervised training for their ability to discriminate source location in this particular environment. More specifically, we deliver estimated time-difference-of-arrivals (TDOA's) and normalized cross-correlation values computed from pairs of hydrophone signals to a random forest model for high-feature-volume classification and feature selection, and subsequently deliver the selected features into linear discriminant analysis, linear and quadratic Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian process models. Based on data from 14 sound source locations and 16 hydrophones, our classification models yielded perfect accuracy at predicting novel sound source locations. Our regression models yielded better accuracy than the established Steered-Response Power (SRP) method when all training data were used, and comparable accuracy along the pool surface when deprived of training data at testing sites; our methods additionally boast improved computation time and the potential for superior localization accuracy in all dimensions with more training data. Because of the generality of our method we argue it may be useful in a much wider variety of contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3037614818,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a leading cause of foodborne outbreaks of human disease, but they reside harmlessly as an asymptomatic commensal in the ruminant gut. STEC serogroup O145 are difficult to isolate as routine diagnostic methods are unable to distinguish non-O157 serogroups due to their heterogeneous metabolic characteristics, resulting in under-reporting which is likely to conceal their true prevalence. In light of these deficiencies, the purpose of this study was a twofold approach to investigate enhanced STEC O145 diagnostic culture-based methods: firstly, to use a genomic epidemiology approach to understand the genetic diversity and population structure of serogroup O145 at both a local (New Zealand) (n = 47) and global scale (n = 75) and, secondly, to identify metabolic characteristics that will help the development of a differential media for this serogroup. Analysis of a subset of E. coli serogroup O145 strains demonstrated considerable diversity in carbon utilisation, which varied in association with eae subtype and sequence type. Several carbon substrates, such as D-serine and D-malic acid, were utilised by the majority of serogroup O145 strains, which, when coupled with current molecular and culture-based methods, could aid in the identification of presumptive E. coli serogroup O145 isolates. These carbon substrates warrant subsequent testing with additional serogroup O145 strains and non-O145 strains. Serogroup O145 strains displayed extensive genetic heterogeneity that was correlated with sequence type and eae subtype, suggesting these genetic markers are good indicators for distinct E. coli phylogenetic lineages. Pangenome analysis identified a core of 3,036 genes and an open pangenome of >14,000 genes, which is consistent with the identification of distinct phylogenetic lineages. Overall, this study highlighted the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity within E. coli serogroup O145, suggesting that the development of a differential media targeting this serogroup will be challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3037022970,"Antimicrobial resistance is becoming a growing health problem, which has become a challenge for the physicians to control infection and also an economic burden on the healthcare. This increase in resistance to the present antimicrobial agents led the researchers to find some alternative and more efficient drugs which can fight with the resistant microorganisms more effectively. Hence, in silico approach is used to design some novel drugs against various targets of microorganisms. For effective virtual screening of the drugs, there is a need to know about the chemical structure and properties of the antimicrobial agents. Therefore, we have prepared a comprehensive database as a platform for the researcher to search for possible lead molecules. Antimicrobial chemotherapeutics database (ACD) is comprised of ~4100 synthetic antimicrobial compounds as well as ~1030 active antimicrobial peptides. The Antimicrobial peptides are mainly from biological sources but some of them are synthetic in nature. Only those compounds, which are found to be active against either bacteria (both Gram-positive and negative) or fungus, are selected for this database.The ACD database is freely available at URL: http://amdr.amu.ac.in/acd, and it is compatible with desktops, smartphones, and tablets."
https://openalex.org/W3037117214,"The lensless optical fluid microscopy is of great significance to the miniaturization, portability and low cost development of cell detection instruments. However, the resolution of the cell image collected directly is low, because the physical pixel size of the image sensor is the same order of magnitude as the cell size. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a super-resolution scanning algorithm using a dual-line array sensor and a microfluidic chip. For dual-line array sensor images, the multi-group velocity and acceleration of cells flowing through the line array sensor are calculated. Then the reconstruction model of the super-resolution image is constructed with variable acceleration. By changing the angle between the line array image sensor and the direction of cell flow, the super-resolution image scanning and reconstruction are achieved in both horizontal and vertical directions. In addition, it is necessary to study the row by row extraction algorithm for cell foreground image. In this paper, the dual-line array sensor is implemented by adjusting the acquisition window of the image sensor with a pixel size of 2.2μm. When the tilt angle is 21 degrees, the equivalent pixel size is 0.79μm, improved 2.8 times, and after de-diffraction its average size error was 3.249%. As the angle decreases, the image resolution is higher, but the amount of information is less. This super-resolution scanning algorithm can be integrated on the chip and used with a microfluidic chip to realize on-chip instrument."

Cell type-specific transcriptomes are critical to reveal the roles of each cell type in the functions and diseases of the prostate. A primary prostate tissue xenograft model was developed using fresh human prostate tissue specimens transplanted onto male mice that were castrated surgically and implanted with a device to maintain circulating testosterone levels comparable to adult human males. Endothelial cells and epithelial cells were isolated from 7 fresh human prostate tissue specimens and from primary tissue xenografts established from 9 fresh human prostate tissue specimens, using antibody-conjugated magnetic beads specific to human CD31 and human EpCAM, respectively. Transcriptomes of endothelial, epithelial and stromal cell fractions were obtained using RNA-Seq. Global and function-specific gene expression profiles were compared in inter-cell type and inter-tissue type manners. Gene expression profiles in the individual cell types isolated from xenografts were similar to those of cells isolated from fresh tissue, demonstrating the value of the primary tissue xenograft model for studies of the inter-relationships between prostatic cell types and the role of such inter-relationships in organ development, disease progression, and response to drug treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3037108550,"Fractures and fracture networks are key conduits for migration of hydrothermal fluids, water and contaminants in groundwater systems Modeling is widely used to understand the environmental risk associated with migration of pollutant for different hydrogeological conditions. In this paper, we proposed a conceptual and mathematical model of flow and transport phenomena in fractured rock systems, and applied in a arsenic contaminate site as a case study. The groundwater flow model and arsenic migration model in fissure-matrix dual system were established. The results show that the velocity of groundwater is positively correlated with inlet pressure, but not with the porosity of the fracture. When the velocity of groundwater is relatively high, arsenic is transported along with the current in a finger-like manner. The distribution of arsenic concentration on the fracture surface is heterogeneous and the phenomenon of diffusion from the fracture to the matrix is not obvious. Indeed, when the velocity of groundwater is relatively small, the arsenic moves forward slowly, the concentration distribution on the crack surface is relatively uniform, and the diffusion phenomenon from the crack to the matrix is more significant."
https://openalex.org/W3037433834,"We have used a combination of computational and structure-based redesign of the low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase, LMW-PTP, to create new activity towards phosphoinositide substrates for which the wild-type enzyme had little or no activity. The redesigned enzymes retain catalytic activity despite residue alterations in the active site, and kinetic experiments confirmed specificity for up to four phosphoinositide substrates. Changes in the shape and overall volume of the active site where critical to facilitate access of the new substrates for catalysis. The kinetics data suggest that both the position and the combination of amino acid mutations are important for specificity towards the phosphoinositide substrates. The introduction of basic residues proved essential to establish new interactions with the multiple phosphate groups in the inositol head, thus promoting catalytically productive complexes. The crystallographic structures of the top-ranking designs confirmed the computational predictions and showed that residue substitutions do not alter the overall folding of the phosphatase or the conformation of the active site P-loop. The engineered LMW-PTP mutants with new activities can be useful reagents in investigating cell signalling pathways and offer the potential for therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W3038072373,"The MGP single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1800801 has previously been associated with recurrent ischemic stroke in a Spanish cohort. Here, we tested for association of this SNP with ischemic stroke recurrence in a North American Caucasian cohort. Acute ischemic stroke patients admitted between 10/2009 and 12/2016 at three hospitals within a large healthcare system in the northeastern United States that were enrolled in a healthcare system-wide exome sequencing program were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with recurrent stroke within 1 year after index event were compared to those without recurrence. Of 9,348 suspected acute ischemic strokes admitted between 10/2009 and 12/2016, 1,727 (18.5%) enrolled in the exome-sequencing program. Among those, 1,068 patients had exome sequencing completed and were eligible for inclusion. Recurrent stroke within the first year of stroke was observed in 79 patients (7.4%). In multivariable analysis, stroke prior to the index stroke (OR 9.694, 95% CI 5.793-16.224, p ≤ 0.001), pro-coagulant status (OR = 3.563, 95% CI 1.504-8.443, p = 0.004) and the AA genotype of SNP rs1800801 (OR = 2.408, 95% CI 1.079-4.389, p = 0.004) were independently associated with recurrent stroke within the first year. The AA genotype of the MGP SNP rs1800801 is associated with recurrence within the first year after ischemic stroke in North American Caucasians. Study of stroke subtypes and additional populations will be required to determine if incorporation of allelic status at this SNP into current risk scores improves prediction of recurrent ischemic stroke."
