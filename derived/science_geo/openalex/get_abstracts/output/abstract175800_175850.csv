https://openalex.org/W2168025729,"Genetic evidence predicts a causative role for amyloid-beta (A beta) in Alzheimer's disease. Recent debate has focused on whether fibrils (amyloid) or soluble oligomers of A beta are the active species that contribute to neurodegeneration and dementia. We developed two aggregation protocols for the consistent production of stable oligomeric or fibrillar preparations of A beta-(1-42). Here we report that oligomers inhibit neuronal viability 10-fold more than fibrils and approximately 40-fold more than unaggregated peptide, with oligomeric A beta-(1-42)-induced inhibition significant at 10 nm. Under A beta-(1-42) oligomer- and fibril-forming conditions, A beta-(1-40) remains predominantly as unassembled monomer and had significantly less effect on neuronal viability than preparations of A beta-(1-42). We applied the aggregation protocols developed for wild type A beta-(1-42) to A beta-(1-42) with the Dutch (E22Q) or Arctic (E22G) mutations. Oligomeric preparations of the mutations exhibited extensive protofibril and fibril formation, respectively, but were not consistently different from wild type A beta-(1-42) in terms of inhibition of neuronal viability. However, fibrillar preparations of the mutants appeared larger and induced significantly more inhibition of neuronal viability than wild type A beta-(1-42) fibril preparations. These data demonstrate that protocols developed to produce oligomeric and fibrillar A beta-(1-42) are useful in distinguishing the structural and functional differences between A beta-(1-42) and A beta-(1-40) and genetic mutations of A beta-(1-42)."
https://openalex.org/W2073998126,"We have identified Wnt10b as a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis that must be suppressed for preadipocytes to differentiate in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that a specific inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3, CHIR 99021, mimics Wnt signaling in preadipocytes. CHIR 99021 stabilizes free cytosolic β-catenin and inhibits adipogenesis by blocking induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. Preadipocyte differentiation is inhibited when 3T3-L1 cells are exposed to CHIR 99021 for any 24 h period during the first 3 days of adipogenesis. Consistent with this time frame of inhibition, expression of Wnt10b mRNA is suppressed upon induction of differentiation, with a 50% decline by 6 h and complete inhibition by 36 h. Of the agents used to induce differentiation, exposure of 3T3-L1 cells tomethyl-isobutylxanthine or cAMP is sufficient to suppress expression of Wnt10b mRNA. Inhibition of adipogenesis by Wnt10b is likely mediated by Wnt receptors, Frizzled 1, 2, and/or 5, and co-receptors low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6. These receptors, like Wnt10b, are highly expressed in preadipocytes and stromal vascular cells. Finally, we demonstrate that disruption of extracellular Wnt signaling by expression of secreted Frizzled related proteins causes spontaneous adipocyte conversion.

In addition, adipose tissue is an endocrine organ that regulates energy homeostasis through secretion of leptin, Acrp30/adiponectin, resistin, and other factors (1Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 18-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The study of adipocyte biology has been greatly facilitated by development of immortalized preadipocyte lines (e.g. 3T3-L1) (2Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (739) Google Scholar) that differentiate into adipocytes and recapitulate many of the metabolic and endocrine functions of adipocytes in vivo. Analysis of differentiation in preadipocyte lines and in animals has led to a paradigmatic model of the genetic program of adipogenesis (3Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 4MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 5Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). In response to stimulators of adipogenesis, two transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ)1 and C/EBPδ are rapidly and transiently induced. These proteins then stimulate expression of the key adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which together induce expression of the complement of genes necessary to create the adipocyte phenotype. Investigations of factors that regulate progression through this adipogenic program are important for our understanding of adipocyte differentiation. Differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes is regulated by a balance of local and endocrine factors that either stimulate or inhibit differentiation (6MacDougald O.A. Mandrup S. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2002; 13: 5-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Well known factors that stimulate differentiation of preadipocyte lines include glucocorticoid agonists, high concentrations of insulin to stimulate the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, PPARγ agonists, and agents that elevate cAMP (3Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Factors that counter these positive stimuli include Wnt10b, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), epidermal growth factor, and prostaglandin F2α (6MacDougald O.A. Mandrup S. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2002; 13: 5-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Of these, Wnt signaling may be of particular physiological importance because its disruption results in spontaneous differentiation, suggesting that endogenous Wnt signaling activity inhibits adipogenesis. The endogenous activator of Wnt signaling is likely to be Wnt10b because expression of Wnt10b is elevated in preadipocytes and declines upon induction of differentiation. Moreover, ectopic expression of Wnt10b activates the Wnt signaling pathway and potently blocks differentiation (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Wnts are secreted glycoproteins that signal through their Frizzled (Fz) receptors, (8Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) co-receptors (9Bejsovec A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R919-R922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to have profound autocrine and paracrine effects on cellular differentiation and growth. There are >16 mouse Wnts, nine Fz receptors, and two LRP co-receptors, LRP5 and LRP6, and specificity of cellular effects may be influenced by the subset of Wnts and signaling molecules expressed (9Bejsovec A.

When Wnt signaling is active, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is inhibited. This loss of GSK3 activity allows cytosolic β-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus where it binds to the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid-enhancing factor family of transcription factors and activates transcription of Wnt-regulated target genes (12Papkoff J. Aikawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, when Wnt signaling is suppressed, GSK3 phosphorylates β-catenin and targets it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (13Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Activity of Wnt proteins is regulated by secreted inhibitors. For example, Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (14Hsieh J.C. Kodjabachian L. Rebbert M.L. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Dawid I.B. Nathans J. Nature. 1999; 398: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and the family of secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) (15Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) appear to bind and sequester Wnts from their receptors. Another family of Wnt inhibitors, dickkopf, binds to the Wnt co-receptor, LRP6, and inhibits interactions with the Wnt-Fz complex (16Mao B., Wu, W., Li, Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 17Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Thus, preadipocyte differentiation could be influenced not only by Wnts but also through regulation of Fz, LRPs, Wnt inhibitors, or downstream signaling intermediates. In this paper we further investigate the role of Wnt10b and Wnt signaling components in preadipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that activation of Wnt signaling during the first days of adipogenesis blocks differentiation and that disruption of extracellular Wnt signaling causes spontaneous adipocyte conversion. Wnt10b is the best candidate for the endogenous inhibitory Wnt, and expression of this gene declines during adipogenesis in response to cAMP. Wnt10b likely signals through Fz1, Fz2, and/or Fz5 receptors, and LRP5 and/or LRP6 co-receptors, because these genes are expressed in preadipocytes and stromal vascular cells. These data further our understanding of the mechanism whereby active Wnt signaling within preadipocytes restrains these cells from undergoing adipogenesis.

Maintenance and adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were as described previously using methylisobutylxanthine dexamethasone and insulin (MDI) (18Hemati N. Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Groblewski G.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25913-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Lipid accumulation in adipocytes was visualized by staining with Oil Red-O (19Erickson R.L. Hemati N. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16348-16355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To quantify retention of Oil Red-O, stained adipocytes were extracted with 1 ml of 4% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) in isopropanol for 15 min, and absorbance was measured by spectrophotometry at 520 nm. To evaluate triacylglycerol in 3T3-L1 cells, Infinity triglyceride reagent (Sigma) was used following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. C2C12 cells (ATCC) were cultured in 20% fetal calf serum supplemented with chick embryo extract (Invitrogen), and G8 cells (ATCC) were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum as described previously (20Blau H.M. Chiu C.P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 21Oderwald H. Hughes M.J. Jost J.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Kinases (see Fig. 1A) were purified from SF9 cells through use of their His or Glu tag. Glu-tagged proteins were purified as described (22Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and His-tagged proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Kinase assays were performed in 96-well plates with appropriate peptide substrates in a 300-μl reaction buffer (variations on 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin). Peptides had Km values from 1 to 100 μm. CHIR 99021 or CHIR GSKIA was added in 3.5 μl of Me2SO, followed by ATP to a final concentration of 1 μm. After incubation, triplicate 100-μl aliquots were transferred to Combiplate 8 plates (Thermo LabSystems) containing 100 μl/well of 50 μm ATP and 20 mm EDTA. After 1 hour, the wells were rinsed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, filled with 200 μl of scintillation fluid, sealed, and counted in a scintillation counter 30 min later. All of the steps were at room temperature. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as 100 × (inhibitor − no enzyme control)/(Me2SO control − no enzyme control). To evaluate levels of free cytosolic β-catenin, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated for 4 h with Me2SO, 3 μm CHIR 99021, 25 mm NaCl, or 25 mm LiCl, and cellular fractionation was performed as described (23Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on an 11.5% gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and β-catenin was evaluated by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories). All data analysis was performed using Bio-Rad multi-analyst software. Epididymal fat pads from at least 12-week-old FVB mice were surgically removed and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for isolation of stromal vascular cells and adipocytes as described (24Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cushman S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 326-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). White adipose tissue (1.5 g) was digested at 37 °C for 1 h in 6 ml of Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mg of collagenase (Worthington) with continuous agitation. Digested adipose tissue was filtered through a mesh to separate cells from connective and undigested tissues. The cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to separate by buoyant density, adipocytes, which are found at the top of the supernatant, from stromal vascular cells, which are found in the pellet. Adipocytes were transferred equally to two 12-ml polypropylene tubes, each containing 8 ml of RNA Stat60 (Tel-Test), and were mixed thoroughly by vortexing. Likewise, 1 ml of RNA Stat60 was added to the pellet and was mixed by trituration. Total RNA was isolated from stromal vascular cells, primary adipocytes, and 3T3-L1 cells by following the manufacturer's protocol for RNA Stat60. Wnt10b riboprobe template was amplified from 3T3-L1 preadipocyte RNA by reverse transcription-PCR with pan-specific Wnt primers (Table I) as described (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 26Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Fz1, Fz5, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase templates were amplified from preadipocyte RNA by reverse transcription-PCR with specific primers (Table I). Fz2, LRP5, and LRP6 riboprobe templates were PCR-amplified from Fz2 (kind gift of T. Malik, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) (11Malik T.H. Shivdasani R.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), LRP5, and LRP6 cDNAs (kind gift of F. Hess, Merck), respectively. PCR products for Wnt10b (384 bp), Fz1 (474 bp), Fz2 (373 bp), Fz5 (388 bp), LRP5 (417 bp), LRP6 (343 bp), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (250 bp) were cloned into pCRII-Topo (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The vectors were linearized forin vitro transcription reactions with T7 or Sp6 RNA polymerases (Promega) to produce 32P-labeled riboprobes. RNase protection assays were performed essentially as described (27Kaestner K.H. Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Janicot M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) except that 150 mm NaCl was used in the digestion buffer.Table IForward and reverse primers used for amplification of Wnt, Fz, and LRP PCR products CHIR 99021 is a small organic molecule that inhibits GSK3α and GSK3β by competing for their ATP-binding sites.In vitro kinase assays reveal that CHIR 99021 specifically inhibits GSK3β (IC50 = ∼5 nm) and GSK3α (IC50 = ∼10 nm), with little effect on other kinases (Fig. 1A). Because inhibition of GSK3 mediates a subset of the cellular effects of insulin, it is not surprising that CHIR 99021 potentiates and mimics the actions of insulin.2 The fact that inhibition of GSK3 also plays a critical role in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway suggests that CHIR 99021 may activate Wnt signaling as well. To determine whether inhibition of GSK3 by CHIR 99021 mimics stimulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with CHIR 99021 or vehicle for 4 h, at which time cells were separated into cytosolic and membranous fractions. As a positive control for pharmacological activation of Wnt signaling, the cells were also treated with LiCl or a control (NaCl). Immunoblot analysis revealed that CHIR 99021, like LiCl, stabilizes free cytosolic β-catenin (Fig.1B), without substantial change to β-catenin associated with membranes (23Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that inhibition of GSK3 by CHIR 99021 mimics the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We have shown previously that Wnt signaling potently inhibits preadipocyte differentiation (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of Wnt signaling by CHIR 99021 also blocks adipogenesis, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with CHIR 99021 or CHIR GSKIA at days 0 and 2 of the standard differentiation protocol. Although adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells is not affected by treatment with the inactive control molecule, treatment with 1 μm CHIR 99021 results in a complete block of differentiation as assessed by Oil Red-O staining, with partial inhibition observed with 0.3 μm CHIR 99021 (Fig.2A). Extraction and quantification of Oil Red-O indicates that half-maximal inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation is observed with ∼0.3 μmCHIR 99021 (Fig. 2B). Thus, inhibition of GSK3 by CHIR 99021 activates Wnt signaling and blocks adipocyte conversion. Differentiation of preadipocytes has been extensively studied, and a model for the cascade of genetic events involved in adipocyte conversion has emerged (3Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 4MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 5Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Although the rapid and transient induction of adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, does not appear to be affected by treatment of differentiating 3T3-L1 cells with CHIR 99021, induction of the master adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ is completely blocked by this molecule (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, induction of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein, 422/aP2, which is downstream of C/EBPα and PPARγ, is also suppressed (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with our prior findings on the mechanism whereby Wnt signaling inhibits preadipocyte differentiation (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with CHIR 99021 for the first 4 days of differentiation completely blocks adipogenesis (Figs. 2A and3). To determine the window of time during which differentiating preadipocytes are sensitive to CHIR 99021, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with the GSK3 inhibitor for the intervals of time indicated (Fig. 3). Exposure of differentiating preadipocytes to CHIR 99021 for 2- or 3-day intervals suppressed differentiation. Indeed, treatment of preadipocytes during any of the first 3 days of adipogenesis is sufficient to completely block the process. In contrast, exposure to CHIR 99021 during the fourth day resulted in only partial inhibition of adipogenesis, and subsequent treatments did not repress differentiation compared with controls (data not shown). Thus, the adipogenesis program is sensitive to inhibition by Wnt signaling during any of the first 3 days of differentiation. Our previous finding that inhibition of Wnt signaling blocks adipogenesis implicates endogenously produced Wnt proteins in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion was never proven directly, and it remained possible that endogenous Wnts are not involved in the regulation of adipogenesis. For instance, our previous results are also consistent with the possibility that TCF activity is constitutive in preadipocytes or alternatively that TCF activity is regulated by another uncharacterized signal. It was critical, therefore, to test directly the involvement of endogenously produced Wnts in the inhibition of adipogenesis. To determine whether sequestration and inactivation of extracellular Wnts causes differentiation in the absence of inducing agents, we exposed preadipocytes to sFRP-1 or sFRP-2, which appear to inhibit Wnt signaling by interfering with Wnt-Fz receptor interactions (15Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Preadipocytes grown in 10% fetal calf serum were exposed to 100 nm sFRP-1 or sFRP-2 every 2 days for 8 days with treatments initiated at 70% confluence. Fourteen days after the initial treatments, ∼20% of preadipocytes exposed to Wnt inhibitors spontaneously differentiated, whereas less than 1% of control cells differentiated under these conditions as assessed by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 4A). As expected, adipogenesis in response to sFRP-1 or sFRP-2 was associated with induction of the adipogenic transcription factor, C/EBPα, as well as the adipocyte protein, 422/aP2 (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Although less dramatic, preadipocyte differentiation in the absence of inducing agents was also observed with the addition of purified recombinant sFRP-3, Wnt inhibitory factor-1, and dickkopf-1 (data not shown). Spontaneous differentiation of preadipocytes in response to extracellular Wnt inhibitors provides strong evidence that endogenously produced Wnts inhibit adipogenesis. Wnt10b is the best candidate for the endogenous inhibitory Wnt because this protein activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and blocks adipogenesis (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Moreover, Wnt10b mRNA is expressed in dividing and confluent 3T3-L1 cells and is largely suppressed within 24 h of induction of differentiation (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). To determine how rapidly Wnt10b is suppressed, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate, and RNA was isolated at the times indicated. RNase protection analyses revealed that expression of Wnt10b declines by ∼50% within 6 h and is undetectable 36 h after induction of differentiation (Fig. 5A). Rapid suppression of Wnt10b during adipogenesis appears to be required for relieving inhibition of GSK3 during this critical period of differentiation, thus allowing adipocyte conversion to occur. Treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with inducers of differentiation is sufficient to suppress expression of Wnt10b. To identify which component or components of the differentiation mixture (i.e.MDI) suppress Wnt10b, we treated confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with 10% fetal calf serum, methyl-isobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, insulin, or combinations thereof. RNA was prepared after 48 h, and Wnt10b mRNA was analyzed by RNase Protection assay. Although Wnt10b mRNA is not suppressed by 10% fetal calf serum, dexamethasone, and/or insulin, the addition ofmethyl-isobutylxanthine is sufficient to repress Wnt10b (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, activation of PPARγ with troglitazone is not sufficient to repress expression of Wnt10b. Suppression of Wnt10b by methyl-isobutylxanthine does not appear to be cell type-specific because this compound also causes a similar decline in expression of Wnt10b in C2C12 and G8 myoblast cell lines (Fig. 5C). Suppression of Wnt10b RNA by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor methyl-isobutylxanthine suggests that elevation of intracellular cAMP is responsible for the decline of Wnt10b during adipogenesis. To confirm that cAMP regulates expression of Wnt10b, confluent preadipocytes were treated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (methyl-isobutylxanthine), a cell-permeable analog of cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP), or an activator of adenylate cyclase (forskolin). After 48 h, RNA was isolated, and repression of Wnt10b in response to these treatments was observed by RNase protection assay (Fig. 5D). Thus, elevated cAMP appears to be the primary signal for repression of Wnt10b during adipogenesis. The Fz family of Wnt receptors is comprised of nine members, and the specificity of interactions between individual Wnts and Fz remains largely uncharacterized. As an initial step toward identifying the Fz through which inhibitory effects of Wnt10b are transduced, we have determined which Fz are expressed within preadipocytes. After cloning and sequencing fragments complementary to each mouse Fz mRNA, RNase protection assays were used to assess the level and pattern of expression of individual Fz during the course of adipogenesis. Fz1, Fz2, and Fz5 mRNAs are expressed at high levels in preadipocytes and are suppressed during differentiation (Fig.6A), suggesting that one or more of these Wnt receptors could mediate the inhibition of adipogenesis by Wnt10b. Although suppression of Wnt10b during adipogenesis is almost exclusively due to elevated cAMP, repression of Fz1, Fz2, and Fz5 mRNAs requires more than one component of the differentiation mixture and appears to be correlated with whether adipogenesis occurs (data not shown). The decline of Fz during adipogenesis will render preadipocytes refractory to secretion of Wnts from neighboring cells, and thus suppression of Fz may be required for differentiation to occur. Wnt signaling is mediated through Wnt receptors, Fz, and Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 (28Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D.

Nature. 2000; 407: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). To determine which LRP is expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, RNase protection analyses of LRP5 and LRP6 were performed. Our data indicate that both LRP5 and LRP6 are expressed constitutively throughout differentiation (Fig.6B). Although the relative affinity of Wnts for LRPs is unknown, based upon the specific activity of our probes, LRP5 is more highly expressed in preadipocytes than LRP6 and thus may be more important for mediating Wnt signals. In contrast to Wnt10b and Fz receptors (Fig. 6A), whose expression declines during adipogenesis, the constitutive expression of LRP5 and LRP6 suggests that suppression of these proteins is not required for adipogenesis and perhaps that these proteins serve other functions within fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We have used 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to characterize the regulation of Wnt10b, Fz receptors, and LRP co-receptors during adipogenesis. To determine whether these members of the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in regulation of preadipocyte differentiation in vivo, we examined expression of each gene in RNA from stromal vascular cells and primary adipocytes. After collagenase treatment of mouse white adipose tissue and fractionation of cell types by buoyant density centrifugation (24Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cushman S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 326-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), RNA was prepared and analyzed by RNase protection assay. Expression of Wnt10b is high in stromal vascular cells and is undetectable in primary adipocytes (Fig.7A), which is consistent with the decline observed during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig.5A) and with Wnt10b playing a regulatory role for adipogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, expression of Fz1, Fz2, and Fz5 in stromal vascular cells but not primary adipocytes suggests that these Wnt receptors may mediate the inhibitory effect of Wnt10bin vivo (Fig. 7B). Unlike the constitutive expression observed in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, suppression of LRP5 and LRP6 in primary adipocytes compared with stromal vascular cells suggests that decline of these co-receptors during adipogenesis requires in vivo signals. Differentiation of preadipocytes is controlled by factors that either repress or stimulate adipogenesis (6MacDougald O.A. Mandrup S. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2002; 13: 5-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Of the inhibitory forces, Wnts appear to be particularly important. Although activation of Wnt signaling during the first days of adipogenesis blocks differentiation (Figs. 2 and 3), disruption of extracellular Wnt signaling results in spontaneous adipogenesis (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that preadipocytes secrete a Wnt or Wnts, which feedback to restrain preadipocytes from undergoing adipogenesis. Wnt10b is an excellent candidate for the endogenous inhibitory Wnt because it blocks adipogenesis through activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) and because expression of Wnt10b declines during adipogenesis in a time frame consistent with subsequent differentiation. Of the standard inducers of differentiation, elevated intracellular cAMP is the primary stimulus for decreasing expression of Wnt10b mRNA (Fig. 5). Inhibition of adipogenesis by Wnt10b is likely mediated by Wnt receptors Fz1, Fz2, and Fz5 because these receptors, like Wnt10b, are expressed in preadipocytes and stromal-vascular cells but not in 3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes (Figs. 6 and 7). In addition, the Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 may mediate the Wnt10b signal because both of these genes are expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and stromal vascular cells. In summary, these data indicate that Wnt signaling through Fz receptors and LRP co-receptors is critical for regulation of adipogenesis and potentially for development of white adipose tissue. Mechanistic analyses of Wnt signaling have been hindered by an inability to purify many members of the Wnt signaling pathway while maintaining their biological activity. To circumvent this problem, we have ectopically expressed Wnts or signaling intermediates to examine the effects of Wnt signaling on adipogenesis. A limitation of this method, however, is that constitutive expression of these signaling molecules does not permit analyses of the time frame during which Wnt signaling inhibits the differentiation program. This problem can be largely overcome with the use of pharmacological agents. Lithium is widely used to mimic Wnt signaling because it inhibits GSK3 and stabilizes free cytosolic β-catenin (30Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, the concentrations needed to reduce GSK3 activity have nonspecific effects on other signaling pathways (30Hedgepeth C.M. Conrad L.J. Zhang J. Huang H.C. Lee V.M. Klein P.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Herein we demonstrate that CHIR 99021 is a highly specific inhibitor of GSK3, and CHIR 99021 activates Wnt signaling as assessed by stabilization of free cytosolic β-catenin and inhibition of adipogenesis in vitro (Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, this small, lipid-soluble molecule provides an ideal tool with which to analyze kinetic and mechanistic aspects of Wnt signaling and its role in differentiation. We have used CHIR 99021 to investigate the mechanism whereby the Wnt signaling pathway blocks preadipocyte differentiation. Activation of Wnt signaling with CHIR 99021 inhibits adipogenesis and the induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ, without detectable effects on transient induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (Fig. 2). Although C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are regulated primarily by methyl-isobutylxanthine and dexamethasone, respectively, expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ is highly correlated with whether preadipocytes undergo adipogenesis (4MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar,31Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Analyses of the mechanism whereby other molecules inhibit adipogenesis (e.g. retinoic acid, TGF-β, TNFα, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo-P-dioxin) reveal a similar pattern of gene expression in which C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are transiently induced, but induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ is inhibited (32Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kurebayashi S. Sumitani S. Kasayama S. Jetten A.M. Hirose T. Endocr. J. 2001; 48: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Chen C.L. Brodie A.E. Hu C.Y. Obes. Res. 1997; 5: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, the time during adipogenesis in which preadipocytes are sensitive to inhibition by CHIR 99021 (Fig. 3) is similar to the time of sensitivity to TNFα, retinoic acid, TGF-β, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo-P-dioxin. These similarities in mechanism of inhibition probably indicate that after day 3 of differentiation, expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ is self-supporting through positive feedback regulation, and thus, adipogenesis is not susceptible to inhibition by these factors. Based upon the paradigmatic view of the adipogenic program (3Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 4MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 5Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), the ability of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ to induce expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ may be subject to inhibition by apparently disparate signaling pathways (i.e. TNFα, TGF-β, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo-P-dioxin, and retinoic acid), all of which result in inhibition of adipogenesis. Alternatively, these agents might act to disrupt the positive feedback loop between C/EBPα and PPARγ. Although pharmacological agents are available to suppress GSK3 activity, there are no such agents that block the Wnt pathway upstream of this enzyme. Thus, to determine whether endogenous Wnts repress differentiation, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with soluble Wnt inhibitors, sFRP-1 and sFRP-2, and we observed considerable spontaneous adipogenesis (Fig. 4). Treatment with Wnt inhibitors consistently stimulated spontaneous adipocyte differentiation prior to background differentiation of control preadipocytes. Although adipogenesis in response to soluble Wnt inhibitors was dramatic in Fig. 4, differentiation in some experiments was only severalfold above background. This variability in the percentage of differentiation may be related to the confluence of the preadipocytes when inhibitor was added, the half-life of the inhibitor, and/or the specificity of Wnt inhibitors for endogenous Wnts. Although both sFRPs and cAMP mimetics are weak adipogenic agents when added alone, sFRPs, like cAMP, may synergize with insulin, glucocorticoids, or other positive effectors of adipogenesis to achieve more complete differentiation. In response to adipogenic cues, preadipocytes suppress expression of Wnt10b to relieve the autocrine repression of differentiation (Fig. 5). These cells, however, could still respond to inhibitory effects of Wnt10b from paracrine sources. Thus, loss of Fz receptors during differentiation may be required for an individual cell to become refractory to Wnts secreted from neighboring cells (Fig. 6). In addition to Wnt10b, Fz1, Fz2, and Fz5, other members of the Wnt signaling pathway such as Wnt5a, sFRP-2, dickkopf-3, dvl2, and TCF3 are also repressed (43Ross S. Erickson R. Gerin I. DeRose P. Bajnok L. Longo K. Misek D. Kuick R. Hanash S. Atkins K. Andresen S. Nebb H. Madsen L. Kristiansen K. MacDougald O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). These data indicate that there is a loss of many Wnts, Wnt regulators, and Wnt signaling intermediates during the process of adipogenesis. This loss may be required because of cross-talk between the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and other signaling pathways. For example, recent evidence indicates that the signaling pathway for TGF-β, another well known inhibitor of adipogenesis, can interact with the Wnt signaling pathway intermediates such as axin (36Furuhashi M. Yagi K. Yamamoto H. Furukawa Y. Shimada S. Nakamura Y. Kikuchi A. Miyazono K. Kato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5132-5141Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and members of the TCF/lymphoid-enhancing factor family of transcription factors. Thus, loss of Wnt signaling intermediates may be necessary to ensure that differentiating preadipocytes are refractory to inhibitors of adipogenesis that act by co-opting part of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We have shown that Wnt signaling is an adipogenic switch that inhibits differentiation when on and that must be shut off for adipocyte conversion to proceed (FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4 and Ref. 7Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Work by Reusch et al. (37Reusch J.E. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) has shown that expression of constitutively active CREB likewise causes spontaneous differentiation. Given that cAMP activates CREB and also causes repression of Wnt10b (Fig. 5), it is tempting to speculate that the spontaneous adipogenesis that results from expression of constitutively active CREB may be, in part, through repression of Wnt10b. Likewise, other genetic interventions that cause spontaneous adipogenesis (e.g. enforced expression of C/EBPα or PPARγ) will also inhibit Wnt10b. Although activators of adipogenesis are expected to repress expression of Wnt10b, it could also be that inhibitors of adipogenesis do so through enforced expression of Wnt10b. Consistent with this idea, a recent report indicates that TNFα stimulates Wnt10b expression in a human gastric cancer cell line (38Saitoh T. Kirikoshi H. Mine T. Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 1187-1192PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that Fz1, Fz2, and Fz5 are expressed in preadipocytes and thus serve as candidate Fz for mediating repressive effects of Wnt10b on adipogenesis. However, we3 and others (39Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) have observed that Fz4 is expressed in primary adipocytes but not during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Although mechanisms of Fz4 action have not been well characterized, this raises the possibility that Wnts play a role in regulation of adipocyte metabolism or other functions within the fully differentiated state. Wnt signaling plays an integral role in differentiation and development of cells and tissues across a wide range of phylogeny. In addition, Wnts play critical roles in regulation of cell growth. Indeed, Wnt10b was originally cloned because of its ability to cause mammary tumor formation (40Lee F.S. Lane T.F. Kuo A. Shackleford G.M. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2268-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although function of Wnt10b has not been extensively characterized, it is believed to have functions in development of mammary gland and hair follicles (41Lane T.F. Leder P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 42Reddy S. Andl T. Bagasra A., Lu, M.M. Epstein D.J. Morrisey E.E. Millar S.E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 107: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with Wnt10b playing an important role in adipogenesis in vitroand likely in vivo, based upon expression in stromal vascular cells but not in adipocytes. Further definition of the roles of Wnt10b in development of adipose tissues, and potentially as a modulator of obesity, await development and analyses of appropriate animal models."

Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). For many of these physiological responses, calcineurin exerts its effects by regulating members of the nuclear factor ofactivated T cells (NFAT)1 family of transcription factors. Calcineurin directly dephosphorylates NFAT transcription factors, causing their activation and translocation to the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 11Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, calcineurin is activated under specific environmental conditions, such as exposure to high extracellular levels of Ca2+ or Na+, elevated temperature, and prolonged incubation with α-factor (Fig.1) (12Cyert M.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 647-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Under many of these conditions, calcineurin is required to maintain cell viability. One consequence of calcineurin-dependent signaling is increased expression ofFKS2/GSC2, which encodes a β-1,3-glucan synthase (13Mazur P. Morin N. Baginsky W., El- Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. Nielsen J.B. Foor F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 24-bp region of the FKS2 promoter, termed the CDRE (calcineurin-dependentresponse element), is necessary and sufficient to direct Ca2+-induced calcineurin-dependent gene expression (14Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). TheCRZ1/TCN1/HAL8 transcription factor was identified as an activator of CDRE-driven transcription as well as a substrate phosphoprotein for calcineurin (14Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 15Mendizabal I. Rios G. Mulet J.M. Serrano R. de Larrinoa I.F.

Crz1p contains a zinc finger motif for DNA binding and binds specifically to the CDRE.crz1 mutants display similar phenotypes to those of calcineurin mutants, and in calcineurin mutants these phenotypes are suppressed by CRZ1 overexpression (14Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 16Matheos D. Kingsbury T. Ahsan U. Cunningham K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, Crz1p functions downstream of calcineurin to effect calcineurin-dependent responses. Calcineurin controls Crz1p activity by regulating its subcellular localization (17Stathopoulos-Gerontides A. Guo J. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When calcineurin-dependent signaling is low, Crz1p is phosphorylated and resides primarily in the cytosol. Once calcineurin is activated, however, it dephosphorylates Crz1p, causing its rapid translocation to the nucleus. This change in localization is the result of increased nuclear import and decreased nuclear export of Crz1p (18Boustany L. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 608-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,19Polizotto R. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, although Crz1p and NFAT display only limited sequence similarity, their modes of regulation by calcineurin are remarkably similar. In addition to FKS2, transcription of several other genes is regulated in a calcineurin/Crz1p-dependent manner. These genes, PMC1, PMR1, and ENA1/PMR2, all encode P-type ATPases that are required for distinct aspects of ion homeostasis. PMC1 encodes a Ca2+-ATPase responsible for Ca2+ sequestration in vacuole (20Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and PMR1 similarly transports Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the Golgi apparatus (21Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K.

Ca2+induces transcription of both PMC1 and PMR1 in a calcineurin/Crz1p-dependent manner, and expression of these genes is required for yeast growth under high Ca2+conditions (24Cunningham K. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). ENA1 encodes a plasma membrane Na+/Li-ATPase that is required for growth in the presence of high concentrations of these ions (25Haro R. Graciadebles B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). ENA1 expression is induced by Ca2+ and Na+ in a calcineurin/Crz1p-dependent manner and by osmotic stresses through the high osmolarity-induced (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (26Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this report, we present a comprehensive identification of yeast genes whose expression is regulated in a calcineurin-dependent manner. We activated calcineurin signaling in vivo by exposing yeast cells to high extracellular levels of Ca2+ or Na+ and used DNA microarrays to analyze the resulting changes in gene expression in the presence and absence of FK506. In this way we identified genes whose expression is dependent on calcineurin and also characterized the transcriptional output of calcineurin-dependent signaling under two different environmental conditions. Furthermore, we examined the transcriptional response of crz1Δ cells under these same conditions. These studies confirm that Crz1p is the major, and possibly the only, effector of calcineurin-regulated gene expression in yeast. We also establish a DNA-binding site for Crz1p, 5′-GNGGC(G/T)CA-3′, using methylation interference analysis and in vitro site selection. Analysis of the upstream regions of calcineurin-dependent genes identified a common sequence motif that closely matches this site. This observation is consistent with direct regulation of calcineurin-dependent genes by Crz1p. The wild-type strain used in this study was S. cerevisiae DBY7286 (MATa ura3-52 GAL2) (28Ferea T.L. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Rosenzweig R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9721-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). YHY804 (MATa ura3-52 GAL2 crz1::KANMX4) was constructed by one-step gene replacement method mentioned integrating kanMX in theCRZ1 locus in the strain DBY7286 as described previously (14Stathopoulos A.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli GST-Crz1p expression plasmid, pRSP121, was made by inserting a HindIII/SalI fragment containing the CRZ1 open reading frame into pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) digested with HindIII and XhoI (19Polizotto R. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% dextrose) was used. Where noted, YPD containing either 0.4 mCaCl2 or 1.6 m NaCl was mixed with an equal volume of YPD to achieve final concentrations of 0.2 mCaCl2 and 0.8 m NaCl. YPD containing 0.4m CaCl2 was buffered to pH 5.0 with 7.5 mm succinate to prevent precipitation of CaPO4. Where noted, a 20 mg/ml stock solution of FK506 (Fujisawa, Inc., Deerfield, IL), in ET (90% ethanol and 10% Tween) or ET was also added to YPD at a 1:20,000-fold dilution (FK506 final concentration, 1 μg/ml). Cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (buffered to pH 5.0 with 7.5 mm succinate) containing ET solution to a density of 0.6 × 107 cells/ml (A600 = 0.6). The culture was divided in two. One part was supplemented with ET at 30 °C for 15 min, and the other part was supplemented with FK506 (1.0 μg/ml final concentration) in ET at 30 °C for 15 min. Cells were collected for thet = 0-min sample. Next, an equal volume of YPD medium (pH 5.0) containing ET and 0.4 m CaCl2 was added to the ET-treated culture (final concentration, 0.2 mCaCl2). An equal volume of YPD medium (pH 5.0) containing FK506 (1.0 μg/ml) and 0.4 m CaCl2 was also added to the FK506-treated culture (final concentration, 0.2m CaCl2). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, frozen at −80 °C, and processed for RNA extraction (see below). Cells were cultured with or without FK506 treatment and exposed to CaCl2 as described for experiments 1 and 2. Samples were collected from the drug-treated and control cultures at 15 and 30 min after Ca2+ addition. Wild-type strain DBY7286 and the crz1Δ strain YHY804 were cultured and exposed to CaCl2 as described for Experiments 1 and 2. Samples were collected at 15 and 30 min after Ca2+addition. Cells were grown in YPD medium (pH 5.0) at 30 °C to a density of 0.6 × 107 cells/ml (A600 = 0.6). The culture was divided in two. One part was supplemented with ET at 30 °C for 15 min, and the other part was supplemented with FK506 (1.0 μg/ml) in ET at 30 °C for 15 min. Cells were collected for the t = 0-min sample. Next, an equal volume of YPD medium (pH 5.0) containing ET solution and 1.6 m NaCl was added to the ET-treated culture (final concentration 0.8 m NaCl). An equal volume of YPD medium (pH 5.0) containing FK506 (1.0 μg/ml) and 1.6 m NaCl was also added to the FK506-treated culture (final concentration, 0.8m NaCl). Samples were collected 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after Na+ addition. Cells were cultured with or without FK506 treatment and exposed to 0.8m NaCl as described for Experiments 5 and 6. Samples were collected from the drug-treated and control cultures at 30 and 45 min after Na+ addition. Wild-type strain DBY7286 and the crz1 mutant strain YHY804 were cultured and exposed to NaCl as described for Experiments 5 and 6. Samples were collected at 30 and 45 min after Na+ addition. Total RNA was extracted by the hot acid phenol method as described (30Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). mRNA was purified from total RNA using the Micro-FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Quantitation of RNA was carried out by UV spectroscopy. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA by reverse transcription and incorporated Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP (AmershamBiosciences) into the cDNA. The fluorescently labeled product was recovered and used as a hybridization probe as described previously (31DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar). The time course experiments were performed by directly comparing the abundance of mRNA relative to the t = 0 sample as shown in Table I. mRNA from the t = 0 sample was labeled with Cy3 (represented as green color), and mRNA from treated samples, harvested at the indicated times, was labeled with Cy5 (represented as red color). mRNA levels of thecrz1 mutant strain were compared with those of the isogenic wild-type strain as shown in Table I. mRNA from the crz1mutant strain was labeled with Cy5, and mRNA from the isogenic wild-type strain was labeled with Cy3. Yeast open reading frame DNA microarrays were prepared, processed, and analyzed as described previously (31DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar). The microarrays were scanned with a Gene Pix 4000 scanner (Axon instruments, Foster City, CA), and the Gene Pix 4000 software package was used to locate spots in the microarray. Each microarray experiment was performed in duplicate. Data analysis was performed using the software GeneCluster and TreeView (32Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13267) Google Scholar). For most data sets, results from two independent microarrays were averaged, and a gene was considered to have consistently altered expression if its average fold change in duplicate arrays was more than two.

Open table in a new tab GST-Crz1p expressed from pRSP121 in E. coli strain BLR was purified from French press extracts using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CDRE probe was generated by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides (CDREB, 5′-TCGACAAGCGCACAGCCACCGACTGGTG-3′ and CDRET, 5′-GATCCACCAGTCGGTGGCTGTGCGCTTG-3′) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Full-length products were purified from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (5 m urea, 15% acrylamide, 1× TBE), and each labeled oligonucleotide was then annealed to its unlabeled compliment by heating to 100 °C and slowly cooling the mixture (1.5 pmol of CDRET, 1.5 pmol of CDREB, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2). Methylation of 0.5 pmol of CDRE was carried out in dimethyl sulfate reaction buffer (50 mm sodium cacodylate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% dimethyl sulfate) for 5 min. EMSA was then carried out as described below using 0.5 pmol of methylated CDRE and 30 pmol of GST-Crz1p. The bands corresponding to the “bound” and “free” CDRE were identified by autoradiography and isolated from the gel. Cleavage at methylated bases was carried out by resuspending the samples in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, and incubating for 15 min at 90 °C, followed by the addition of NaOH to 100 mm and incubating an additional 30 min. The fragments were then separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (20% acrylamide, 1× TBE, 5 m urea) and visualized by autoradiography. The EMSA was carried out in 20 μl of gel shift buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.5 pmol of methylated CDRE, 30 pmol of GST-Crz1p, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was run on a native 4% polyacrylamide TBE gel, dried down, and visualized by autoradiography. GST-Crz1p purified from E. coli (see above) was incubated with a partially degenerate pool of DNA sequences. Sequences that bound GST-Crz1p were then isolated using EMSA, amplified by PCR, and enriched by carrying out three more cycles of EMSA followed by PCR. Finally, the selected sequences were subcloned and sequenced. Experimental details of each step are as follows. A 60-nucleotide oligonucleotide, 5′-CAGTCAGTTCAAAGCTTCAT(N)20AAGTCTAGAACTGACTAGTC-3′ (where N is any of the four bases and the HindIII and XbaI sites in the constant regions that were included for subcloning are underlined) was made double-stranded by PCR using primers complementary to the constant regions (primer 1, 5′-GACTAGTCAGTTCTAGACTT-3′, and primer 2, 5′-CAGTCAGTTCAAAGCTTCAT-3′) and 20 cycles under the following conditions: 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 50 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. The PCR was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs) except that 1 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled primer 2 was included in the reaction. Primer 2 was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) as recommended by the manufacturer and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). The double-stranded product (dsR60) was gel isolated from a native 8% polyacrylamide/TBE gel. The first round of EMSA was performed in 50 μl of gel shift buffer (see above) to which 10 pmol of dsR60, 3 μg (29 pmol) of pure GST-CRZ1p, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) were added. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the bound molecules were separated from the free on a native 4% acrylamide/TBE gel, and the bound fraction was localized by comparison with a parallel lane in which the CDRE sequence localized within a 60-bp DNA fragment served as probe. The bound fraction was electroeluted from the gel slice, ethanol-precipitated, and amplified by PCR as described above. Rounds 2–4 were carried out like round one except that 6 pmol of dsR60 were used in the EMSA. Following PCR amplification of round 4, the selected molecules were digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting clones were sequenced using BigDye (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed at the Stanford PAN Facility (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). For each gene that was expressed ≥4-fold more in wild-type than crz1Δ cells in at least one experiment (40 total), 800 bp of DNA sequence upstream of the ATG was analyzed using MEME (www.sdsc.edu/MEME/meme/website/meme.html) (33Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar) and Regulatory Sequence Analysis tools (embnet.cifn.unam.mx/∼jvanheld/rsa-tools/) (34van Helden J. Andre B. Collado-Vides J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 16: 177-187Google Scholar) to identify common motifs. Crz1p-binding sequences identified through site selection were also analyzed using MEME. The goal of these studies was to identify, in a comprehensive manner, the genomic targets of the calcineurin/Crz1p signaling pathway. To this end, we exposed yeast to either 200 mm Ca2+ or 0.8 mNa+, and we used DNA microarrays to examine the gene expression of all of the open reading frames nominally encoded by theS. cerevisiae genome (see “Experimental Procedures”). The DNA microarray experiments performed in this study are summarized in Table I. First, to identify genes regulated by Ca2+ or Na+, we characterized the pattern of gene expression at several times from 5 to 60 min after exposure of yeast to these ions. In each case the Ca2+ or Na+-treated sample was compared with the same culture prior to ion addition. Second, to identify the specific subset of genes that are regulated by the calcineurin signaling pathway, we carried out the same time course analysis using cells treated with FK506, a specific inhibitor of calcineurin, prior to the addition of either Na+ or Ca2+ (see “Experimental Procedures”). Third, we directly compared the transcriptional response of FK506-treated cells to that of non-drug-treated cells after Ca2+ or Na+ addition. Finally, to examine the role of the Crz1p transcription factor, we compared the transcriptional response of a crz1 strain (YHY804) to that of its isogenic wild-type parent (DBY7286) after treatment with Ca2+ or Na+. Data collected from all of these experiments were organized by hierarchical clustering. This method groups genes according to their similarity in expression pattern, such that genes that display the most similar patterns throughout the data set are arranged together (32Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13267) Google Scholar). The clustered data were then graphically displayed using the TreeView program (Fig.2) (32Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13267) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). An overview of the DNA microarray results is presented in Fig. 2. Of the 6,166 genes that could be scored, expression of 2,523 (41%) was altered at least 2-fold in two or more experiments. These genes were selected for further analyses. Some general patterns are apparent from visual inspection of these data. First, cells exposed to Ca2+ showed significant changes in gene expression by 5 min (974 genes). The number of genes showing ≥2-fold changes reached a maximum at 15 min (1509 genes) and then declined slightly at 30 min (1176 genes) and further at 60 min (287 genes). Thus, samples taken 15 and 30 min after Ca2+ addition showed the greatest overall change in gene expression. For this reason, when comparing FK506-treated versus non-treated cells and crz1 versus wild-type cells after exposure to Ca2+, we restricted our analysis to these time points. In contrast, the number of genes whose transcript levels changed by ≥2-fold within 15 min of transfer to high Na+ medium was considerably smaller (189 genes). More changes were observed by 30 min (1219 genes), and overall changes in gene expression peaked at 45 min (1493 genes) and then decreased by 60 min (1265 genes). Thus, in further characterizations of Na+-treated cells, we analyzed changes only at the 30- and 45-min time points. Inspection of this full data set reveals several characteristics of the calcineurin-dependent gene cluster. First, only a small subset of the genes whose transcript levels change in response to Ca2+ or Na+ is calcineurin-dependent (Fig. 2). Second, under these conditions, calcineurin mainly mediates activation of gene expression rather than repression, as the most prominent differences in FK506-treated samples reflect decreased expression levels. Third, there is notable similarity in the gene expression patterns of FK506-treated cells and crz1 cells, suggesting that Crz1p is required for most calcineurin-dependent changes in gene expression. Finally, the magnitude and number of calcineurin-dependent changes in gene expression is significantly greater in response to Ca2+ treatment than Na+ treatment, although this is not the case for the overall changes as noted above. These points will be discussed further below. Our entire data set is available at www.stanford.edu/group/cyert/microarray.html. We used two criteria to identify genes whose induction by Ca2+ or Na+ was dependent on calcineurin. First, we identified genes whose expression was increased more than 2-fold by Ca2+ or Na+ in the time course experiments (experiments 1 and 3, see Table I). In total, 934 genes were induced more than 2-fold by Ca2+ at either 15 or 30 min, and 931 total genes were induced more than 2-fold by Na+ at 30 or 45 min. Second, we assessed the extent to which the expression of each of these genes was reduced by calcineurin inhibition by direct comparison of FK506-treated and non FK506-treated cells exposed to Ca2+ or Na+ (experiments 5 and 6, see Table I). Specifically, we defined the Green/Red expression ratio from the Ca2+ + FK506/Ca2+ or Na+ + FK506/Na+ DNA microarrays as a calcineurin dependence score (CNCa, and CNNa, respectively, see Fig.3), where the green-labeled sample corresponds to non-drug-treated cells and the red-labeled sample corresponds to FK506-treated cells. For these analyses we sampled two different time points, 15 and 30 min for Ca2+ and 30 and 45 min for Na+, and the larger of these two values was used to represent the calcineurin dependence of each gene. Genes with a calcineurin dependence score of ≥2 were considered to be calcineurin-regulated.FIG. 3Calcineurin-dependent genes. A, list of genes with calcineurin dependence score ≥2 following exposure to both Ca2+ and Na+ (CNCa and CNNa ≥2). The Crz1p dependence score (CRZCa and CRZNa) is also shown. (See text for explanation of dependence scores.) Expression data for each gene are displayed using TreeView (see legend for Fig. 2). Gene names and functions were downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Data base (genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/).

These studies were extended to neuronal cell culture employing the parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Pretreatment with EGCG (0.1–10 μm) attenuated human neuroblastoma (NB) SH-SY5Y cell death, induced by a 24-h exposure to 6-OHDA (50 μm). Potential cell signaling candidates involved in this neuroprotective effect were further examined. EGCG restored the reduced protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) activities caused by 6-OHDA toxicity. However, the neuroprotective effect of EGCG on cell survival was abolished by pretreatment with PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (1 μm). Because EGCG increased phosphorylated PKC, we suggest that PKC isoenzymes are involved in the neuroprotective action of EGCG against 6-OHDA. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed that EGCG prevented both the 6-OHDA-induced expression of several mRNAs, such as Bax, Bad, and Mdm2, and the decrease in Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xL. These results suggest that the neuroprotective mechanism of EGCG against oxidative stress-induced cell death includes stimulation of PKC and modulation of cell survival/cell cycle genes.

Consistent with these findings is the fact that antioxidants and iron chelator-based neuroprotective strategies are at the focus of attention in determining how to neutralize OS-induced damage. Dietary antioxidants, especially tea and tea polyphenols, have attracted increasing interest because of their well reported biological effects including radical scavenging (3Salah N. Miller N.J.

This effect was achieved by preventing the translocation to the nucleus of the inflammatory and OS-responsive transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (10Levites Y. Youdim M.B.H. Maor G.

On the other hand, tea or more specifically its polyphenolic fraction has been reported to decrease the incidence of carcinogen-inducing malignancies in animal models (12Stoner G.D. Mukhtar H. J.

Med. 2000; 29: 1222-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Neuronal damage, emerging from OS, has been reported to involve regulation of cell signaling molecules, as well as activation of apoptotic pathways (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 22Satoh T. Nakatsuka D. Watanabe Y. Nagata I. Kikuchi H. Namura S.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested a fundamental role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of cell survival and programmed cell death (24Whelan R.D. Parker P.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J.

Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this line, it was shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor prevented the decline in PKC activity as a consequence ofN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity in primary rat cortical neurons (28Tremblay R. Hewitt K. Lesiuk H. Mealing G. Morley P. Durkin J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) protected the hippocampal cell line from glutamate toxicity, and this effect was mediated through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (26Maher P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the regulation of ERK1/2 and JNK activities in neurodegeneration induced by reactive oxygen species has been reported previously (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is supported by the fact that specific pathway inhibitors conferred protection against different cell death-promoting agents (22Satoh T. Nakatsuka D. Watanabe Y. Nagata I. Kikuchi H. Namura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 288: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 29Singer C.A. Figueroa-Masot X.A. Batchelor R.H. Dorsa D.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that flavonoids can activate MAPK signaling cascades in both neuronal and extraneuronal tissues; the flavonoid catechin was shown to counteract the induction of both ERK1/2 and JNK, induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein in primary cultures of mice striatal neurons (30Schroeter H. Spencer J.P. Rice-Evans C. Williams R.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Furthermore, green tea polyphenol fraction and EGCG were demonstrated to modulate ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways in human hepatoma HepG2 (31Yu R. Jiao J.J. Duh J.L. Gudehithlu K. Tan T.H. Kong A.N. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and cervical squamous carcinoma HeLa cells (32Chen C., Yu, R. Owuor E.D. Kong A.N. Arch. Pharm. Res. 2000; 23: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and/or inhibit Ras-MAPK pathway in human prostate cancer DU145 cells (33Chung J.Y. Park J.O. Phyu H. Dong Z. Yang C.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2022-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).The aim of the present study was to investigate the different aspects involved in neuronal damage induced by 6-OHDA, a neurotoxin that induces cell death via OS (34Glinka Y.Y. Youdim M.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 292: 329-332PubMed Google Scholar, 35Choi W.S. Yoon S.Y., Oh, T.H. Choi E.J. O'Malley K.L. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and in neuroprotection afforded by EGCG. We have shown that EGCG prevents neuronal cell damage at low concentrations, whereas high doses promote cell death. Our results suggest the involvement of PKC and ERK1/2 as well as modulation of cell survival/cell cycle genes in the neuroprotective action of EGCG.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of EGCG against 6-OHDA-induced oxidative damage. Detailed investigation on the mechanism mediating this neuroprotective effect shows, for the first time, that restoration of the reduced PKC and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels induced by 6-OHDA, as well as modulation of antiapoptotic-related genes, mediate EGCG action. Given that the neuroprotective action of EGCG was blocked by inhibition of PKC activity, we suggest that activation of PKC is part of the neuroprotective mechanisms that are activated by this polyphenol to counteract death signals in neuronal cells. However, the possible contribution of the established radical scavenging action of EGCG cannot be ruled out.These results are in accordance with our recent studies showing that green tea extract or its individual EGCG polyphenol can prevent mice striatal dopamine depletion and nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss in the MPTP mice model of Parkinson's disease (13Levites Y. Weinreb O. Maor G. Youdim M.B.H. Mandel S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Further support comes from in vitro studies, where green tea and black tea extracts were shown to exhibit potent neuroprotection against 6-OHDA-induced damage in NB SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells, via inhibition of nuclear translocation of the OS and inflammatory-responsive transcription factor NF-κB (10Levites Y. Youdim M.B.H. Maor G. Mandel S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Moreover, EGCG or Ginkgo biloba extract, known to be enriched with flavonoids, protects hippocampal neurons from β-amyloid-derived peptide (Aβ)- or nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity (18Choi Y.T. Jung C.H. Lee S.R. Bae J.H. Baek W.K. Suh M.H. Park J. Park C.W. Suh S.I. Life Sci. 2001; 70: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 19Bastianetto S. Ramassamy C. Dore S. Christen Y. Poirier J. Quirion R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1882-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 39Bastianetto S. Zheng W.H. Quirion R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2268-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the polyphenol epicatechin was shown to attenuate neurotoxicity induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein in mouse-derived striatal neurons (30Schroeter H. Spencer J.P. Rice-Evans C. Williams R.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that EGCG was equally potent against the cellular toxicity caused by Aβ and by the active metabolite of MPTP, methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in NB SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). Our recent studies have clearly shown that EGCG is not only able to protect but even to rescue PC12 cells against the Aβ-(25–35, 1–40, 1–42) toxicity.2 This highlights the pharmacological potential use of EGCG after the damage has been caused.EGCG has a concentration window of neuroprotective action: it protects against 6-OHDA at concentrations up to 10 μm, whereas higher doses are pro-toxic. This bell-shaped pattern is typical of antioxidative drugs, such as green tea extract (10Levites Y. Youdim M.B.H. Maor G. Mandel S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), vitamin C (40Halliwell B. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 25: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), R-apomorphine (41Gassen M. Pinchasi B. Youdim M.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Deacon E.M. Pongracz J. Griffiths G. Lord J.M. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and dopamine (36Gassen M. Gross A. Youdim M.B. Mov. Dis. 1998; 13: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), being neuroprotective at low (1–10 μm) concentrations, while having pro-oxidant activity at higher (10–50 μm) concentrations.There is evidence from neuronal and non-neuronal models that PKC may be necessary for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and it has also been implicated in the control of cell survival and programmed cell death (24–27,42). The rapid loss of neuronal PKC activity is a common consequence of several brain damages, such as ischemia (43Cardell M. Wieloch T. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 44Busto R. Globus M.Y. Neary J.T. Ginsberg M.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and glucose deprivation (45Small D.L. Monette R. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J. Barbe G. Mealing G. Morley P. Buchan A.M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, PKC activation has been suggested to represent a pivotal therapeutic target. Only a small number of compounds have been reported to prevent the decline in PKC activity, observed in response to a variety of insults. These include brain-derived neurotrophic factor or vasoactive intestinal peptide, which were shown to protect primary rat cortical neurons (28Tremblay R. Hewitt K. Lesiuk H. Mealing G. Morley P. Durkin J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and mice white matter tissue (46Gressens P. Marret S. Martin J.L. Laquerriere A. Lombet A. Evrard P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2574-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), respectively, against excitotoxic insults, through activation of PKC. We found that 6-OHDA toxicity is accompanied by a decline in phosphorylated PKC levels, suggesting that promotion of cell death by 6-OHDA involves inactivation of PKC. This effect was completely abolished by pretreatment with EGCG. In addition, EGCG increased phosphorylated PKC, suggesting that EGCG-mediated protection of neuronal cells from 6-OHDA damage is dependent on PKC activation. This is supported by the findings that the general PKC inhibitor GF 109203X completely abolished the protection induced by EGCG in response to 6-OHDA toxicity. PMA, a direct activator of PKC, mimicked the protection afforded by EGCG against the toxin, further indicating the crucial role of PKC in cell survival. EGCG significantly increases the levels of PKC-α and -ε isoforms in mouse hippocampus.2 These isoforms play a crucial role in cell survival pathways (24Whelan R.D. Parker P.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Maher P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gubina E. Rinaudo M.S. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Mufson R.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 823-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which EGCG affects the expression of PKC isoforms is being investigated.In an attempt to characterize the signaling pathways involved in 6-OHDA-induced cell death and in neuroprotection by EGCG, we examined the activity of two major MAPKs, which have been implicated in neuronal survival, ERK1/2, and JNK (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 22Satoh T. Nakatsuka D. Watanabe Y. Nagata I. Kikuchi H. Namura S. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 288: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK1/2 is associated with pro-survival signaling (48Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar), whereas JNK activation has been strongly linked to apopoptotic signaling (49Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) through phosphorylation of c-Jun (50Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The observation that ERK1/2 signaling is involved in neuronal survival has also been demonstrated in primary cortical neurons intoxicated with glutamate (29Singer C.A. Figueroa-Masot X.A. Batchelor R.H. Dorsa D.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in PC12 cells, in which apoptosis was induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal (21Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that 6-OHDA decreased ERK1/2 activity, whereas treatment with EGCG prevented this effect. Further support for the role of this pathway in cell survival is provided by studies showing that activation of ERK1/2 plays a major role in the neuroprotective effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (51Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) or activation of glial metabotrophic glutamate receptors (52D'Onofrio M. Cuomo L. Battaglia G. Ngomba R.T. Storto M. Kingston A.E. Orzi F., De Blasi A., Di Iorio P. Nicoletti F. Bruno V. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) against drug-induced apoptosis or N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced toxicity in primary neuronal cultures, respectively. In addition, 6-OHDA caused an increase in JNK phosphorylation, but EGCG failed to prevent the activation induced by the toxin, suggesting that activation of this MAPK superfamily pathway might be necessary but not sufficient to induce neuronal apoptosis.Previous studies have shown that the neurotoxicity of 6-OHDA involves nuclear translocation of NF-κB (10Levites Y. Youdim M.B.H. Maor G. Mandel S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), increase of reactive oxygen species, activation of JNK, inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (34Glinka Y.Y. Youdim M.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 292: 329-332PubMed Google Scholar), and apoptotic cell death (23Chun H.S. Gibson G.E. DeGiorgio L.A. Zhang H. Kidd V.J. Son J.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 35Choi W.S. Yoon S.Y., Oh, T.H. Choi E.J. O'Malley K.L. Oh Y.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,53Maruyama W. Akao Y. Youdim M.B.H. Naoi M. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2000; 60: 147-162Google Scholar). The increased expression of the apoptotic-related genes and the decrease in Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xL mRNAs observed with 6-OHDA in our study supports previous reports and provides a wider view of the gene events implicated in 6-OHDA toxicity. The induction of the proapoptotic genes Bax and Bad can induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, culminating in activation of caspases (49Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Because EGCG prevented all the gene alterations induced by 6-OHDA, a conjecture could be raised suggesting a possible link between activation of PKC and ERK1/2, induction of cell survival genes, and mitochondrial function preservation. Interestingly, recent reports support a role for PKC as a functional Bcl-2 kinase that can suppress cell apoptosis, probably through direct or indirect phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (54Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 55Zhao M. Eaton J.W. Brunk U.T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whether EGCG activation of PKC leads to Bcl-2 phosphorylation and subsequent suppression of apoptosis remains to be determined.Our gene analysis also provides the first evidence for a selective regulation of a number of mRNAs by the low (1 μm) neuroprotective concentration of EGCG, including a decrease in Bax mRNA. Bax homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (56Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). These interactions have been shown to determine the susceptibility of a cell to a death signal. Decreased Bax mRNA levels, as a result of EGCG treatment, may contribute to an increase in the ratio of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to Bax (57Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), thus suggesting potential neuroprotective/antiapoptotic features of EGCG. There is no clear evidence whether the observed inhibition of p21Waf1 and Gadd45β cell cycle regulators by EGCG may have any protective effects against oxidative stress-induced damage, because most studies have investigated their effects as tumor suppressors.Mdm2 is the major negative regulator of p53 and is itself a positive transcriptional target of p53. Its expression is often elevated subsequent to induction of p53 activity. Mdm2 is a ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 to proteasomal degradation, thus defining a negative feedback loop to regulate p53 levels (for review see Ref. 58Michael D. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation of Mdm2 transcript by EGCG might consequently preserve intact p53 protein and also contribute to the protective action against 6-OHDA, where high Mdm2 mRNA levels were observed.In contrast to the neuroprotective properties of EGCG at low concentrations, EGCG is more often known for its antitumorigenic/pro-apoptotic properties. The cell death promotion and increased expression of pro-apoptotic and cell cycle regulator-linked genes, induced by a high EGCG concentration (50 μm), supports and extends previous reports: increased consumption of relatively high concentrations of tea polyphenols has been found to correlate with reduced incidence of certain cancers (6Yang C.S. Wang Z.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1038-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) and to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (59Ahmad N. Feyes D.K. Nieminen A.L. Agarwal R. Mukhtar H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Recently, EGCG was shown to induce apoptosis of neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and to cause a decrease in phosphorylated ERK1/2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL proteins, an increase in Bax, and an activation of caspase 9 (60Masuda M. Suzui M. Weinstein I.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4220-4229PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work we show that high EGCG concentration also decreased ERK1/2 activity and increased that of JNK, further supporting its pro-apoptotic/antiproliferative effect. The comparative actions of EGCG, as presented in our study, at its protective and toxic concentrations is depicted in Table II.Table IIComparison of the effects of a protective (1 μm) versus a toxic (50 μm) concentration of EGCGRegulatory effectsEGCG (1 μm)EGCG (50 μm)Cell viabilityNCNeurotoxicNeuroprotective properties against6-OHDA (50 μm)NeuroprotectiveIncreased neurotoxicityMPP+ (400 μm)NeuroprotectiveIncreased neurotoxicityAβ-(25–35, 1–40, 1–42) (10 μm)2-aData not shown; NC, not changed; Aβ, β-amyloid peptide.Neuroprotective/NeurorescuingIncreased neurotoxicityCell signaling activationPKCActivationNCERK1/2NCReducedJNKNCIncreasedExpression of apoptotic/antiproliferative genesDecreasedIncreased2-a Data not shown; NC, not changed; Aβ, β-amyloid peptide. Open table in a new tab The mechanism underlying the effectiveness of EGCG against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity is not fully known but may involve several events. A hypothetical model diagramming the multiple potential targets of EGCG effects is shown in Fig. 7. (a) Direct scavenging of oxidized 6-OHDA or of oxygen species derived from 6-OHDA, because green tea polyphenols are known to be radical scavengers and iron chelators. Nevertheless, the concentrations of EGCG required for neuroprotection are far lower than those of 6-OHDA used in the assay, arguing against a simple stoichiometric reaction. This assumption is also supported by the fact that EGCG concentrations higher than 10 μm could not prevent the toxic effects of 6-OHDA and even exacerbated it (data not shown). (b) Counteracting the negative effect of 6-OHDA on both PKC and ERK1/2 pathways because alternatively ERK1/2 might be subjected to direct regulation of PKC; thus, activation of this kinase by EGCG may lead to restoration of the reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. (c) Inhibiting the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, as previously shown for green tea extract (10Levites Y. Youdim M.B.H. Maor G. Mandel S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). (d) Preventing the expression of cell death and cell cycle regulators genes. (e) Other mechanism(s) not yet defined.In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence of a neuroprotective mechanistic action of EGCG against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity by stimulating PKC and modulating the expression of cell survival factors. Biochemical evidence points to central roles for oxidative stress (OS)1 and inflammation in neuronal death in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (1Gerlach M. Ben-Shachar D. Riederer P. Youdim M.B.H. J.

Using a rat femur model of bone healing to determine the degree of transcriptional complexity of these processes, suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed between RNA isolated from intact bone to that of callus from post-fracture (PF) days 3, 5, 7, and 10 as a means of identifying up-regulated genes in the regenerative process. Analysis of 3,635 cDNA clones revealed 588 known genes (65.8%, 2392 clones) and 821 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (31%, 1,127). The remaining 116 cDNAs (3.2%) yielded no homology and presumably represent novel genes. Microarrays were then constructed to confirm induction of expression and determine the temporal profile of all isolated cDNAs during fracture healing. These experiments confirmed that ∼90 and ∼80% of the subtracted known genes and ESTs are up-regulated (≥2.5-fold) during the repair process, respectively. Clustering analysis revealed subsets of genes, both known and unknown, that exhibited distinct expression patterns over 21 days (PF), indicating distinct roles in the healing process. Additionally, this transcriptional profiling of bone repair revealed a host of activated signaling molecules and even pathways (i.e. Wnt). In summary, the data demonstrate, for the fist time, that the healing process is exceedingly complex, involves thousands of activated genes, and indicates that groups of genes rather than individual molecules should be considered if the regeneration of bone is to be accelerated exogenously. The healing of skeletal fractures is essentially a replay of bone development, involving the closely regulated, interdependent processes of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis.

J. Bone Jt. Surg. 1995; 77-A: 940-956Crossref Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Even with a majority of fractures healing appropriately, over 30,000,000 days each year are lost because of disability or confinement of patients, leading to a tremendous loss of productivity and income. Given the great potential of both tissue and genetic engineering, it is anticipated that exogenous acceleration of fracture healing could increase the overall numbers of fractures that heal successfully, as well as reduce the number of patient days lost due to incapacity. To achieve this goal, however, it is essential that we expand our understanding of the interdependent stages of fracture healing (inflammation, chondrogenesis, ossification, remodeling), and ideally, how they contribute to a biomechanically functional bone. A number of biochemical and biophysical interventions have been devised with the goal of accelerating the healing of skeletal fractures. The biological strategies include biomimetically inspired skeletal graft substitutes (hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate), purified or recombinant molecules with chondrogenic and osteogenic attributes (i.e. growth factors), gene therapy, and stem cell reservoirs introduced by biodegradable matrices (2Hannouche D. Petite H. Sedel L. J. Bone Jt. Surg. 2001; 83: 157-164Crossref Google Scholar). The biophysical arsenal includes low intensity ultrasound (3Hadjiargyrou M. McLeod K. Ryaby J.P. Rubin C. Clin. Orthop. 1998; 355: S216-S229Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 4Rubin C. Bolander M. Ryaby J.P. Hadjiargyrou M. J. Bone Jt.

Orthop. 1998; 355: S90-S104Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). While the basic science foundation supporting these modalities is strong, the clinical results have been inconclusive. Therefore, it becomes reasonable to conclude that the complexity of the healing process is being underestimated and that the healing process cannot ultimately be determined by a singular idealized molecule, material, or stimulus. The great majority of studies that have examined the molecular basis of healing have focused on the expression of specific genes, with the bulk of these studies concentrating on the regulatory role of known extracellular matrix (ECM)1genes (7Jingushi S.

While this extensive body of excellent work has helped demonstrate the temporal and spatial roles of specific genes, it has also served to indicate that we have limited knowledge of how extensive the transcriptional control of the repair process may be or identify which specific processes are the critical regulators of successful bone healing. With the advent of more sophisticated techniques in gene expression analysis (i.e. microarrays), it becomes possible to simultaneously examine the transcriptional activity and interaction of thousands of genes. Given the biological complexity of fracture healing, a process morphologically characterized by inflammation, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it is regulated by a very large number of transcriptional events (22Hadjiargyrou M. Ahrens W. Rubin C.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Hadjiargyrou M. Rightmire E.P. Ando T. Lombardo F.T. Bone (N. Y.). 2001; 9: 149-154Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the marked similarities between the repair process of bone and embryonic development of the skeleton, marked by key cellular events (migration, adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation), all of which require the tightly orchestrated activity of thousands of proteins whose expression patterns rely on both extracellular and intracellular signals. The work reported here combines SSH (24Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar) and custom cDNA microarrays (25Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7512) Google Scholar) to elucidate the transcriptional complexity of bone regeneration, as modeled in the rat femur (26Bonnarens F. Einhorn T.A. J. Orthop. Res. 1984; 2: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The data demonstrate that a very large number of genes are transcriptionally regulated during the repair process over the distinct, but interdependent, stages of healing. A large number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are also identified, which are then clustered with respect to functionally known gene families. Furthermore, we identify the Wnt pathway as an example of a signaling pathway involved in the repair process. Taken together, these results constitute the first demonstration of the transcriptional complexity underlying the early phases of the healing mammalian fracture callus and may help to identify critical components, as well as novel candidate genes, essential for successful bone regeneration. All methods and animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the University's Laboratory Animal Users Committee and met or exceeded all federal guidelines for the humane use of animals in research. The rat femur fracture model was described previously (26Bonnarens F. Einhorn T.A. J. Orthop. Res. 1984; 2: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) and used extensively in our studies (22Hadjiargyrou M. Ahrens W. Rubin C.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Hadjiargyrou M. Rightmire E.P. Ando T. Lombardo F.T. Bone (N. Y.). 2001; 9: 149-154Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Hadjiargyrou M. Halsey M. Ahrens W. Rightmire E. McLeod K.J. Rubin C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1998; 249: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A set of four animals was euthanized each at 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days post-fracture and a set of three animals at 21 days. Following euthanasia by CO2 inhalation, the contralateral control femur from each animal, as well as the fracture calluses, were dissected free and processed for RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from each individual fracture callus, as well as from each intact bone, which included bone marrow and articular and normal growth plate cartilage, using the ToTALLY RNA kit (Ambion) based on the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and as described previously (22Hadjiargyrou M. Ahrens W. Rubin C.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Hadjiargyrou M. Rightmire E.P. Ando T. Lombardo F.T. Bone (N.

Com. 1998; 249: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The samples used for these analyses were derived by pooling the RNA from two intact femurs and comparing it with RNA pooled from the fracture callus tissues of one animal harvested at each of PF days 3, 5, 7, and 10. Complimentary DNAs were synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH), and subtractive hybridization was performed with a PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH). cDNAs derived from the fracture callus material, considered the “tester” pool, and cDNAs from intact femurs, considered the “driver” pool, were digested inRsaI (New England Biolabs). To select transcripts up-regulated by the fracture repair process, PCR adaptors were ligated to the tester pool population (fracture callus). The tester cDNA pool was then hybridized with excess cDNAs (∼15-fold) from the driver pool (control bones). After hybridization, suppression PCR using primers specific for the tester PCR adaptors selectively amplified differentially expressed transcripts. Amplified cDNA sequences were then ligated into the T/A cloning vector pT-Adv (CLONTECH). Approximately, 4,500 cDNA clones were sequenced using an ABI 3700 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Finally, all sequences were checked for homology using the BLAST algorithm found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. For blastn, ∼65% of the sequences had E values of 2.0 × 10−19 or better (parameters: BLOSUM62; word size 12). For blastp, ∼40% of the sequences had E values of 1.0 × 10−6 or better (parameters: BLOSUM62; default NCBI Gap Costs). Differential screening of the fracture callus-induced transcript library was performed through a series of steps. First, individual colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C in 500 μl of Luria broth medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The next morning, 2 μl of the culture was transferred to individual wells of a 96-well PCR plate containing 98 μl of PCR master mix (10 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 2 μl of 10 μm pT-Adv nested primers 1 and 2, 1 μl of 20 μm dNTPs, 82 μl of sterile H2O, and 1 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Using the GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), PCR amplification was performed by cycling for 2 min at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles consisting of 40 s at 95 °C and 3 min at 68 °C. PCR amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and ∼90% of the clones were found to contain inserts, with an average insert size of 250–500 bp. To prepare nylon arrays of the PCR-positive clones, free primers were removed from the PCR reactions by filtration and the samples concentrated to ∼50 ng/μl. Each sample was then spotted on the nylon filters (0.25 μl/spot). In addition to the 3,635 subtracted cDNA clones (representing all 588 known genes, the 821 ESTs and 116 novel sequences), 257 control samples were also spotted (mitochondrial DNA, ribosomal RNA, genomic DNA, plasmid, actin, tubulin, GAPDH, yeast DNA, buffer, bacterial DNA (Escherichia coli/Bacillus subtilis), as well as mammalian DNA (mouse, rat, human, monkey)). Membranes were denatured by soaking for 10 min in a solution of 0.5 mm NaOH, 1.5 mm NaCl, and neutralized by successive 5-min washes in 0.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm NaCl, and 2× sodium chloride-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer. The membranes were then UV cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). RNA derived from the calluses of three animals was pooled for each separate time point (PF days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21). The RNA sample representing intact bone was established by pooling specimens from intact femurs of three different animals. The protocol used for labeling target, hybridization, and washings was identical to that for GeneFilters from Research Genetics, with the exception that the last wash was carried out in a stringent wash in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, all the blots were simultaneously exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 days prior to capturing the final image using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Each membrane image was analyzed using the GenePix Pro (version 3.0) microarray software package. Measurements of the optical intensity of the 244 pixels contained within each spot generated a median intensity value. The average background intensity was then calculated from the 1,060 blank spots scattered throughout each membrane. This average background intensity was then subtracted from the median intensity of each spot and normalized to the 18 S ribosomal RNA-positive control spots. Finally, replicate spots for each gene were averaged prior to further analysis. Clustering of the up-regulated genes, as a function of time, was performed using average linkage analysis following data normalization and filtering (includes background subtraction and normalization as stated above (Image analysis)). In addition, a block effect correction was also performed. We defined blocks in two directions. First, 38 rank blocks were generated based on the mean intensity value for each gene, and second, four (2 × 2) adjacent blocks were combined. Each of these block effects was calculated using a generalized linear model and corrected from the intensity which led to the residual value from the generalized linear model fitting. Finally, the median of each rank block for each array was added to this residual. Since a single representative value was needed for each gene, and since some genes were represented by multiple cDNA clones (more than one spot on the membrane), some spots that generated inconsistent expression patterns as compared with others (of the same gene) were considered as outliers and were filtered out. Based on correlation (both Pearson's and Spearman's), 403 spots were excluded due to their inconsistent expression patterns (as described previously), and another 29 spots were excluded because of their low expression level (negative intensity values). With this normalized intensity value, we performed pairwise average linkage cluster analysis to establish clusters by grouping genes which shared the same/similar temporal expression patterns. Pearson's correlation coefficient, which statistically captures similarity in “shape” was used as similarity measure. The final number of clusters was determined to be 16 using pseudo F and pseudo t2 statistics (29Calinski T. Harabasz J. Commun. Stat. 1974; 3: 1-27Crossref Google Scholar, 30Duda R.O. Hart P.E. Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1973Google Scholar). To show that the final selection and number of clusters were reasonable, intracluster correlations of each of the 16 clusters, as well as the results from discriminant analysis, were examined. This data analysis was performed in logarithm base 2 space after standardization. To establish an in depth understanding of the transcriptional activity occurring during the early stages of a healing rat femur fracture, RNA was examined from four different time points (PF days 3, 5, 7, and 10) and compared with that of intact bone (containing cartilage and bone marrow). These initial time points were selected to represent specific physiological events of the healing callus, including inflammation, chondrogenesis, and ossification (Fig.1). The spatial complexity and structural interdependence of these early events of the mammalian callus have been described previously (7Jingushi S. Joyce M.E. Bolander M.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1045-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Sandberg M.M. Aro H.T. Vuorio E.I. Clin. Orthop. Rel. Res. 1993; 289: 292-312PubMed Google Scholar, 19Einhorn T.A. Clin.

Of the 4,500 cDNAs derived from SSH, ∼3,635 were successfully sequenced (contained a readable insert). After BLAST searches, of 3,635 clones, 65.8% had homology to 588 known genes (represented as 382 singletons), 31% had homology to 821 ESTs, and the remaining 3.2% (116) had no homology match and presumably represent completely novel genes. The known genes reflected a variety of families with diverse functions in cell cycle regulation, cell matrix and cell adhesion, ECM construction, inflammation, general metabolism, signaling, transcriptional regulation, protein transport, etc. (Supplemental Table 1). The abundance of each gene within the library (represented as # of clones) is also indicated in this table. Several genes encoding for matrix proteins like collagens, osteopontin, osteonectin, fibronectin (7Jingushi S. Joyce M.E. Bolander M.E. J. Bone Miner.

Res. 1999; 14: 1805-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), already known to be highly up-regulated during the fracture repair process, were present and were interpreted to be indicative of the success of SSH. In addition, the most abundant genes present were also matrix genes such as collagen type I (α1/2, 240 clones), collagen type III (190 clones), OSF-2 (95 clones), tenascin (59 clones), and fibronectin (57 clones) (Supplemental Table 1). Given the large number of cDNA clones present in the subtracted library, it was deemed practical to analyze the expression of all cDNA clones simultaneously through the use of custom microarrays. These microarrays included the complete subtracted library (3,635 cDNAs), as well as 257 control spots (see “Experimental Procedures”). Initially, experiments utilizing the identical RNA samples (from single animal per time point) used in SSH were utilized to confirm the hybridization results, as well as the production and integrity of the microarrays. Results from these experiments yielded reproducible data between each run (data not shown). Once confirmed, RNA samples from multiple animals at each specific PF time point were pooled (n = 3), and hybridizations of arrays were repeated to show how transcriptional activity was modulated as a function of time in the healing process as compared with RNA samples from intact bone (n = 3). Hybridization was performed using a total of seven identical membranes, one for each of the six PF time points (days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21), as well as one for intact bone (control). We found that ∼90 and ∼80% of the subtracted known genes and ESTs are up-regulated (≥2.5-fold) during the repair process (at any given PF day), respectively. The remaining cDNA clones probably represent false positives, most likely resulting from the SSH. Representative membranes following hybridization of RNA isolated from intact bone and PF day 10 callus are shown in Fig.2 and clearly demonstrate differential gene expression. Data resulting from imaging the seven filters was used to generate scatter plots, representing the ratio for each gene between each of the PF day callus (y axis) over that of intact bone (x axis, Fig. 3). The figure clearly shows the increased gene expression (shift of dots to they axis) during the progression of the fracture callus through its early stages (PF days 3–10), thus confirming the initial subtraction (designed to identify up-regulated genes). Relative to intact bone, the highest level of expression is observed at PF day 14 (note the higher intensity and shift of dots), and by PF day 21, expression levels begin to decline toward the control (represented bydiagonal line, Fig. 3). Based on these data, the exact temporal expression levels of all known genes are shown in Supplemental Table 2 and demonstrate that the expression patterns change extensively throughout the healing process and that these shifts are distinctly different from gene to gene. Finally, the fold change in expression observed in this study for many of these genes (i.e.collagens, osteopontin, osteonectin, etc.) are consistent with those previously determined using Northern analyses by our laboratory (22Hadjiargyrou M. Ahrens W. Rubin C.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,23Hadjiargyrou M. Rightmire E.P. Ando T. Lombardo F.T. Bone (N. Y.). 2001; 9: 149-154Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as well as others (8Sandberg M.M. Aro H.T. Vuorio E.I. Clin. Orthop. Rel. Res. 1993; 289: 292-312PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hirakawa K. Hirota S. Ikeda T. Yamaguchi A. Takemura T. Nagoshi J. Yoshiki S. Suda T. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Hiltunen A.

Res. 1999; 14: 1891-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In an attempt to group known genes, ESTs and novel cDNAs based on their co-regulated expression patterns, cluster analysis was performed using data derived from the microarray experiments. Statistical analysis generated 16 distinct clusters (Fig. 4and Supplemental Table 3). A common feature of each cluster is the trend of the expression pattern, which invariably shifts upwards from intact to PF, indicating the expected up-regulated expression of genes relative to intact bone. Furthermore, the clusters show distinct patterns of expression, ranging from gene activity which peaked early and then declined (Fig. 4A, Clusters 1, 10, 13, and 16), to clusters that continue to rise through the healing process (Fig. 4B, Clusters 4, 9, 11, and 12). A number of other clusters show a pattern of successive increased and decreased expression, indicating fluctuations in general metabolic activity (Fig. 4C, Clusters 5, 8, and 14). A final group of clusters display a pattern of a steady increase for the first 2 weeks and then a sharp decline by the 3rd week (Fig. 4D, Clusters 2, 3, 6, 7, and 15), indicating the end of various physiological processes (Fig. 1). Clusters 2 and 3 contained the greatest number of genes that included the majority of the well known matrix genes (e.g. collagen types I, II, III, IV, V, VI, XI, and XII and bone sialoprotein, osteonectin, osteopontin, fibronectin, laminin, lumican, versican, tenascin, decorin, biglycan, and glypican), growth factors (IGF-I, TGF-β, FGF-7), growth factor receptors (PDGF and NGF), transcription factors (hypoxia inducible factor 1α, c-fos, and Sox9), as well as a very large number of genes representing other gene families (Supplemental Table 3). In addition, these two clusters also included over 600 functionally unknown genes (∼57%) represented either as novel or EST sequences or known genes with no assigned function. Since there were many signaling molecules present in our subtracted cDNA library (Supplemental Table 1), we decided to examine the possibility of identifying active pathways that participate in bone regeneration. One of the more complete signaling pathways identified (based on the number of involved molecules) is the Wnt signaling pathway (31Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). More specifically, we identified Wnt-5A, Frizzled, casein kinase II, β-catenin, and phosphatase 2A, all of which were robustly up-regulated during the repair process (Table I). In addition, we also show the identity and expression levels of a number of genes that represent known transcriptional targets of the Wnt pathway (i.e.c-myc, fibronectin, retinoic acid receptor gamma, connexin 43, and OSF-2) (Table I).Table ITemporal expression of Wnt signaling pathway members and target genesPF 3PF 5PF 7PF 10PF 14PF 21MembersWnt-5A3.51.01.33.62.81.0Rat Frizzled2.14.46.35.14.45.3Casein kinase II2.64.93.73.82.11.0β-Catenin1.83.04.85.95.33.7PP2A0.71.31.21.73.31.2Target genesc-myc1.01.51.91.11.72.1Fibronectin2.55.05.46.14.93.1Retinoic acid RC-γ1.42.12.82.52.41.3Connexin 434.46.17.47.78.65.5OSF-22.36.45.57.26.53.8 Open table in a new tab The ability of bon"

We now show that stress signals initiated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) induce G1 arrest through protein stabilization of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1. TGF-β1 was previously shown to increase p21 protein levels, which in turn mediated G1 arrest through inactivation of the CDK2-cyclin E complex in HD3 cells (Yan, Z., Kim, G.-Y., Deng, X., and Friedman, E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9870–9879). We now demonstrate that the increase in p21 abundance is caused by a post-transcriptional, SMAD-independent mechanism. TGF-β1 activated p38α and JNK1, which initiated the phosphorylation of p21. TGF-β1 treatment increased the half-life of p21 by 3–4-fold. The increase in p21 stability was detected following activation of p38α and JNK1, and treatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 prevented this increase in p21 stability. p38α and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 in vivo, and both p38α and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 at Ser130in vitro. Peptide mapping demonstrated that both TGF-β1 and p38α induced phosphorylation of p21 at Ser130in vivo, and mutation of Ser130 to alanine rendered p21 less stable than wild-type p21. TGF-β1 increased the stability of wild-type p21, but not the p21-S130A mutant. These findings demonstrate that SAPKs can mediate cell cycle arrest through post-translational modification of p21. Stress signals activate the SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK classes of protein kinases, which mediate cellular responses, including steps in apoptosis and the maturation of some cell types. We now show that stress signals initiated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) induce G1 arrest through protein stabilization of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1.

(2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9870–9879). We now demonstrate that the increase in p21 abundance is caused by a post-transcriptional, SMAD-independent mechanism. TGF-β1 activated p38α and JNK1, which initiated the phosphorylation of p21. TGF-β1 treatment increased the half-life of p21 by 3–4-fold. The increase in p21 stability was detected following activation of p38α and JNK1, and treatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 prevented this increase in p21 stability. p38α and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 in vivo, and both p38α and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 at Ser130in vitro. Peptide mapping demonstrated that both TGF-β1 and p38α induced phosphorylation of p21 at Ser130in vivo, and mutation of Ser130 to alanine rendered p21 less stable than wild-type p21. TGF-β1 increased the stability of wild-type p21, but not the p21-S130A mutant. These findings demonstrate that SAPKs can mediate cell cycle arrest through post-translational modification of p21. cyclin-dependent kinase proliferating cell nuclear antigen glycogen synthase kinase-3β stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase transforming growth factor-β1 hemagglutinin extracellular signal-regulated kinase glutathione S-transferase dominant-negative green fluorescent protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase MAPK kinase Cell cycle progression is mediated by the sequential activation of members of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 family. Cell cycling is blocked when CDK-cyclin complexes cannot form or when the catalytic activity of these complexes is blocked through binding of a CDK inhibitor molecule. One of these inhibitors is p21Cip1/Waf1(1Harper J. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar), which was originally identified as a PCNA-binding protein (2Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). p21 inhibits DNA replication by preventing PCNA from contributing to DNA polymerase δ and ε function (3Waga S. Hannon G. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). The p21 gene was also identified as a gene induced by the tumor suppressor p53 (4El-Deiry W. Tokino T. Velculescu V. Levy D. Parsons R. Trent J. Lin D. Mercer W. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar) and by cellular senescence (5Noda A. Ning Y. Tadich P. Venable S. Pereira-Smith O. Smith J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). p21 is a major mediator of the G1 growth arrest induced by activation of p53 in response to DNA damage (reviewed in Ref. 6Scherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Additional critical roles of p21, as important as the p21 cell cycle inhibitory function, are its ability to stabilize the CDK4-cyclin D1 complex and to target CDK4 and cyclin D1 to the nucleus (7LaBaer J. Garrett M. Stevenson L. Slingerland J. Sandhu C. Chou H. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). p21 promotes assembly of CDK4-cyclin D complexes and increases cyclin D1 accumulation by direct inhibition of GSK3β-triggered nuclear export (8Alt J.R. Gladden A.B. Diehl J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8517-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, p21 is not simply a growth inhibitor. Although most of the studies on p21 regulation have concentrated on its transcriptional regulation by p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms, a series of new studies have shown that p21 can be regulated by post-translational mechanisms. p21 is an unstable protein with a half-life of <30 min and is degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner (9Sheaff R. Singer J. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J. Clurman B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Ser146 and Thr145 are within both the PCNA-binding domain and the nuclear localization domain of p21. Phosphorylation of p21 at Ser146 was shown to occur in vivo and to block p21/PCNA interaction (10Scott M. Morrice N. Ball K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylates p21 at Thr145in Her-2/neu-transformed NIH3T3 cells (11Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Lee M.-H. Hung M.-C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), at Thr145 in nontransformed human endothelial cells (12Rössig L. Jadidi A. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and at both Thr145 and Ser146 in glioblastoma cells (13Li Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Akt also activates GSK3β, which phosphorylates p21 at Thr57 (14Rössig L. Badorff C. Holzmann Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation at Thr57 has been reported to destabilize p21 (14Rössig L. Badorff C. Holzmann Y. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr145 does not affect p21 stability, but results in the translocation of p21 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in Her-2/neu-transformed NIH3T3 cells (11Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Lee M.-H. Hung M.-C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p21 at other sites within the PCNA-binding domain, the nuclear localization signal, the CDK-binding domain, or the cyclin-binding regions could be expected to modulate p21 activity and localization. In accordance with these expectations, it has been shown that mutation of the binding site for CDKs (W49R/F51S/D52A) increases p21 abundance by increasing its half-life, whereas mutation of the PCNA-binding site (M147A/D149A/F150A), which is also the proteasomal protein C8-binding domain (16Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), decreases p21 levels by increasing its rate of turnover (15Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate a novel function for the stress-activated protein kinases SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK: the capacity to mediate increased protein stability of p21 by inducing phosphorylation at Ser130in vitro and in vivo. TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems. Antibodies to p21 and to the FLAG epitope were from Transduction Laboratories and Sigma, respectively, and antibodies to the HA epitope and JNK1/2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Akt, phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, activated p38 MAPK, and p38 MAPK were from Cell Signaling and New England Biolabs Inc. Purified recombinant GST-p38α and JNK1 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper (Immobilon-P) was purchased from Millipore Corp. All radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences.

All other reagents were from Sigma. pMT-5/p21Cip1-FLAG and its derivatives p21-T145A and p21-T145D were the kind gifts of Dr. M.-C. Hung. Wild-type p21Cip1 was subcloned into pCMV-tag2 (Stratagene) for site-directed mutagenesis by the GeneEditor in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). All mutant p21 constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutated sequence. FLAG-p38α, FLAG-p38β, FLAG-DN-p38α, and FLAG-DN-p38β, all in pcDNA3, were the generous gifts of Dr. J. Han. pcDNA3-FLAG-DN-JNK1(apf) was from Dr. R. Davis; wild-type pSrα3-HA3-JNK1 was from Dr. M. Karin; pSBE4-BV4/luc (where SBE is SMAD-binding element) and its control p6MBE-luc were from Dr. S. Kern; p21WWP-luc was from Dr. B. Vogelstein; SMAD4ΔC-FLAG was from Dr. R. Derynck; and p3TP-lux was from Dr. J. Massagué. p3TP-lux is composed of three TGF-β response elements and a fragment of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and can respond to SMAD-independent signaling pathways activated by TGF-β1. For transient transfections, cells were plated in 12-well plates at an approximate density of 3 × 105 and cultured for 24 h. LipofectAMINE (5 μl/well) was mixed with a total of 720 ng of DNA for 30 min in serum-free medium and then added to the cells in serum-free medium for 16–18 h with or without 6 ng/ml TGF-β1, and luciferase activity was determined. Transfected DNA samples were composed of 200 ng of reporter construct, 20 ng of the pCMV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and, depending on the experiment, 500 ng of test expression plasmid or vector control DNA. Cells were lysed, and both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using a TD-20/20 luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for differences in transfection efficiency. Each experiment was performed using triplicate data points and performed three to four times. The HD3 human colon carcinoma cell line used in this study was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, modified, and supplemented as described (17Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described for TGF-β1 treatment (18Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in 100-mm dishes were lysed in 0.7 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μmsodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride (lysis buffer). Lysates were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. JNK was isolated using anti-JNK antibody-agarose (10 μl/mg of protein), which was incubated with the cell lysate at 4 °C for 2 h and then washed five times with lysis buffer before analysis. p38 was isolated with anti-p38α antisera (1:50) by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, and immunoprecipitates were isolated by incubation with 10 μl of protein G-agarose for 1 h and then washed five times with lysis buffer before analysis. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA), incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μm unlabeled ATP plus 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of purified recombinant p21 protein as substrate, and then analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. Following treatment as indicated and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed as indicated (19Ewton D. Kansra S. Friedman E. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Depending upon the experiment, 20–50 μg of the cell lysate was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (or in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and 3–5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with the primary antibody (1:500 dilution of antibodies to p21Cip1 and tubulin; 2 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody; 0.5 μg/ml anti-actin antibody; and 1:1000 dilution of antibodies to HA, GFP, Akt, phospho-Akt, ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2), and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. 20 μg of total RNA from each cell line was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer. The membranes were hybridized to a full-length p21Cip1 cDNA. Probes were labeled with32P by random priming. The blot was hybridized overnight at 68 °C with at least 107 cpm of the labeled probe, washed three times for 7 min at room temperature with 1× SSC and 1% SDS, washed for 20 min at 65 °C with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and autoradiographed. The blots were stripped and rehybridized to GAPDH. Chymotrypsin cleavage and two-dimensional analysis of p21 phosphopeptides were carried out as described (20van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Following an in vitro kinase assay or immunoprecipitation of phospho-labeled proteins, the substrate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the protein band was identified by autoradiography and excised from the membrane. Proteins were digested with sequencing grade chymotrypsin (20 μg in 200 μl of freshly prepared 50 mmNH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C), and the polypeptides were spotted onto 20 × 20-cm thin-layer cellulose plates and separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis for 45 min at 1000 V on an HTLE-7002 electrophoresis system (C.B.S. Scientific Co., Inc.) using buffer containing 2.2% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid at pH 1.9. Peptides were separated in the second dimension by chromatography for 9 h in phosphochromatography buffer (38% 1-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid). Dried plates were exposed to Eastman Kodak Biomax MS film for 2–8 days. Ser(P)130 was found in fragment 78–150 (pI 7.03), and Thr(P)57 was found in fragment 54–63 (pI 3.24). p21 constructs were subcloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed and purified as described (21Frangioni J. Neel B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 ml of LB medium was seeded with 10% of an overnight culture of JM109 cells carrying the desired expression plasmid and incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 24 °C, and bacteria were collected by centrifugation and frozen at −70 °C. Pellets (averaging 2 g each) were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitors (Complete mini-tabs protease inhibitor mixture set, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and Sarkosyl was added to a final concentration of 1.5% (w/v). Bacteria were lysed by sonication using a microtip (Misonix, setting 2.5) for 3 min with 5-s bursts separated by 5 s of rest. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g to remove insoluble material. 2% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and an additional 1× protease inhibitor mixture were added to the clarified lysates, and 13-ml portions were incubated with 1 ml (bed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C overnight with end-on rotation. Beads were washed six times with 10 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.3)). GST fusion proteins used forin vitro kinase assays were eluted from the beads by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 1 ml of glutathione elution buffer (75 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100) per ml of bead volume used. Recombinant p21 used in immune complex kinase reactions was cleaved from GST by incubation with thrombin (50 units/ml of bead volume in phosphate-buffered saline; Amersham Biosciences) for 18 h at room temperature. Thrombin was removed from the preparation by incubation with 1 ml of benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were scanned using a Lacie Silverscanner DTP and a Power Macintosh 64, and densitometry was performed using the IP Lab Gel program (Scanalytics). Up-regulation of protein levels of the CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 is known to mediate the growth arrest of normal cells. The HD3 colon carcinoma line cell line has many characteristics of normal colonic epithelial cells and was cloned from its parental cell line because of its unusual “flat” morphology. At high density, the line spontaneously differentiates into one of the lineages in the normal colon, the fluid-transporting enterocyte. Differentiated cells exhibit a brush border and are joined by functional junctional complexes of tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes (18Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). HD3 cells exhibit some normal growth control, as they can be synchronized in G1 by density arrest and are arrested in G1by TGF-β1. Arrest occurs through inhibition of the kinases that phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (22Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 increased p21 abundance up to 9-fold in HD3 cells as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). These elevated levels of p21 bind to and block CDK2 kinase activity as shown by immunoprecipitation of CDK2 and kinase assay of histone H1 (23Yan Z. Kim G.-Y. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9870-9879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All these data are consistent with the known growth-arresting properties of TGF-β1. The unexpected finding was that the TGF-β1-induced increase in p21 protein levels in HD3 cells was mediated at the post-transcriptional level. Most studies have concentrated on transcriptional activation of p21. The increase in abundance of p21 in HD3 cells occurred rapidly and was detectable within 1–3 h (Fig. 1B; mean of two experiments). HD3 cells exhibit both mutant p53 (22Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar) and the truncation mutation SMAD4Q311st (23Yan Z. Kim G.-Y. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9870-9879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), so transcription of p21 is p53-independent and should be independent of TGF-β1-activated SMAD proteins. TGF-β1 did not increase p21 mRNA levels in HD3 cells (Fig. 1D; mean of two experiments, p21 mRNA normalized to GAPDH mRNA) or activate a p21 promoter reporter (Fig. 1C) in these cells. Taken together, these data confirm that the increase in p21 protein abundance by TGF-β1 is mediated by post-transcriptional, SMAD-independent mechanisms. We next wished to determine which signaling pathways mediate the rapid post-transcriptional increase in p21 protein levels. TGF-β1 can initiate both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent signaling pathways. Because HD3 cells exhibit the truncation mutation SMAD4Q311st (23Yan Z. Kim G.-Y. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9870-9879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), TGF-β1 signaling should be SMAD-independent. To resolve this issue, we cotransfected pSBE4-BV/luc, a reporter containing four repeats of an 8-bp palindromic SMAD-binding element that is known to be activated only by a SMAD3-SMAD4 complex (24Zawel L. Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Vogelstein B. Kern S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), into HD3 cells together with SMAD4 expression plasmids. The pSBE4-BV/luc reporter was activated only by TGF-β1 when wild-type SMAD4 (but not DN-SMAD4ΔC) was cotransfected (Fig. 2A). Parallel experiments demonstrated that TGF-β1 could not activate a mutant form of this reporter construct (p6MBE) when cotransfected with either wild-type or mutant SMAD4 (data not shown). Therefore, endogenous SMAD4 is nonfunctional, and TGF-β1 signaling is SMAD-independent in HD3 cells. TGF-β1 initiates several SMAD-independent signaling pathways, including Ras/ERK (25Mulder K. Morris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5029-5031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rho/JNK (26Afti A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (30Bakin A. Tomlinson A. Bhowmick N. Moses H. Arteaga C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36803-36810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), and possibly others. Because phosphorylation of p21 at Ser146 has been reported to stabilize p21 (13Li Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), we concentrated on TGF-β1-activated kinases that might phosphorylate p21in vivo. p70 S6 kinase has been reported to be unable to phosphorylate p21Cip1 (12Rössig L. Jadidi A. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), so p70 S6 kinase was not studied. TGF-β1-activated kinase pathways that can be inhibited by chemical agents were examined initially. Activation of the 3TP-lux promoter reporter in HD3 cells by TGF-β1 was challenged by treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, or the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. TGF-β1 activation of 3TP-lux was blocked by SB203580, but not by LY294002 (Fig.2B), indicating that TGF-β1 activates p38 MAPK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and therefore not Akt in HD3 cells. PD98059 caused a strong activation of TGF-β1 signaling in HD3 cells, implying that activated ERKs block TGF-β1 signal transduction. Activated p38 is known to complex with ERK1/2 (31Zhang H. Shi X. Hampong M. Blanis L. Pelech S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6905-6908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), so it is possible that blocking activation of ERKs leads to further up-regulation of p38 activity. These transient transfection data suggest that TGF-β1 activates p38 (but not Akt, ERK1/2, or SMAD) signaling in HD3 cells. These data were confirmed by biochemical analysis. The increase in p21 abundance in HD3 cells was detectable within 1–3 h (Fig.1B), so any TGF-β1 signaling that affects p21 must occur within this time frame. TGF-β1 activates p38 MAPK and JNK within 30 min, so both may play a role in p21 modulation. The activities of p38α and JNK1 were determined by immune complex kinase reaction using exogenous purified p21 protein cleaved from GST as substrate (Fig.3A). Cells were treated with 6 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 0–300 min, and p38α or JNK1 was immunoprecipitated at various times as indicated. TGF-β1 activated both p38α and JNK1 by 15–30 min, and both kinases phosphorylated p21. The activity returned to background levels by 300 min. Controls include preimmune rabbit serum. Equal amounts of IgG were detected in the immunoprecipitates, and equal amounts of exogenous p21 were analyzed (Fig. 3A, lower panel). GST had been cleaved from recombinant p21 before assay and migrated as a non-phosphorylated band at ∼29 kDa (data not shown). A similar time course for p38 and JNK activation was seen when the kinase reaction was performed with activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) as substrate (data not shown), which is a known in vivosubstrate of the stress-activated MAPKs. In contrast, TGF-β1 did not activate Akt or increase the low level activation of ERKs in HD3 cells within 30 min (Fig. 3B, left panel) or 60 min (right panel), confirming the transient transfection data. Treatment with epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor was used as a positive control to activate ERKs and Akt. Therefore, the increase in p21 abundance does not occur through ERK or Akt activation. Because TGF-β1 was shown to activate p38 in HD3 cells (Figs. 2 and 3), the effect of p38 inhibition on accumulation of the p21 protein was assayed. Treatment with the p38α/β inhibitor SB203580 blocked the TGF-β1-mediated increase in p21 abundance in a dose-dependent manner, with the amount of p21 halved by treatment with 5–10 μm (Fig.4A, upper panel). As a control for the specificity of the inhibitor, p21 mRNA levels were assayed by Northern analysis, and no modulation by SB203580 was seen (Fig. 4A, lower panel), indicating that the effects on p21 are post-transcriptional and probably post-translational. The p21 protein is unstable, with a short half-life of ∼20–30 min in most cells. To determine whether the elevated levels of p21 in TGF-β1-treated HD3 cells (Fig. 1) were due to protein stabilization, the turnover of the p21 protein was assayed. The half-life of p21 was determined by Western blotting after blocking translation with cycloheximide and was normalized to actin abundance determined on the same Western blot (Fig. 4, C and E; means ± S.E. of four separate experiments). The half-life of p21 was increased to ∼90–120 min by TGF-β1 treatment of HD3 cells, whereas SB203580 at 10 μmblocked the TGF-β1-mediated increase in the p21 half-life (Fig. 4, B–E). At a slightly higher concentration than used here, SB203580 also inhibits the activity of JNK (32Porter C. Havens M. Clipstone N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3543-3551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), so both p38 and JNK could play a role in stabilizing the p21 protein. The same increase in half-life by TGF-β1 and inhibition by SB203580 were seen when p21 levels were determined by immunoprecipitations during a cold chase following a 3-h pulse label with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Fig. 4, B and D). Therefore, TGF-β1 functions to increase p21 abundance by stabilizing the p21 protein through activation of p38 MAPK and possibly JNK. In contrast, treatment with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 did not block the TGF-β1-mediated increase in the p21 half-life (data not shown), indicating that p38 (but not ERKs) modulate p21 stability in HD3 cells. There are two predicted phosphorylation sites for the MAPK superfamily in p21 that are conserved between human and rodent, Thr57-Pro and Ser130-Pro. Constructs were made by site-directed mutagenesis to mutate each site individually to alanine and to doubly mutate to T57A/S130A. An additional construct was made to mutate the Akt site of Ser146 to alanine. An autoradiogram of anin vitro kinase assay of these GST-p21 constructs plus the Akt site mutant T145A is shown in Fig.5A. Phosphorylation of GST-p21 constructs in vitro by purified recombinant JNK1 and by purified recombinant p38α was decreased by 75% by both the T57A mutation and the T57A/S130A double mutation, indicating that both kinases phosphorylate p21 predominately at Thr57in vitro. Mutation of Ser130 to alanine reduced the phosphorylation by both kinases by ∼20% in each of three experiments (Fig. 5B). p21 constructs mutated at Ser146 and Thr145 (Akt sites) were still strongly phosphorylated by p38α and JNK1, indicating that neither kinase phosphorylates p21 at these s"

Although leptin receptors are present in the heart, it is not known whether leptin also regulates cardiac fatty acid metabolism. To determine whether leptin directly regulates cardiac fatty acid metabolism, isolated working rat hearts were perfused with 0.8 mm[9,10-3H]palmitate and 5 mm[1-14C]glucose to measure palmitate and glucose oxidation rates. Leptin (60 ng/ml) significantly increased palmitate oxidation rates 60% above control hearts (p < 0.05) and decreased TG content by 33% (p < 0.05) over the 60-min perfusion period. In contrast, there was no difference in glucose oxidation rates between leptin-treated and control hearts. Although leptin did not affect cardiac work, oxygen consumption increased by 30% (p < 0.05) and cardiac efficiency was decreased by 42% (p < 0.05). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a major role in the regulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and reducing malonyl-CoA levels. Leptin has also been shown to increase fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle through the activation of AMPK. However, we demonstrate that leptin had no significant effect on AMPK activity, AMPK phosphorylation state, ACC activity, or malonyl-CoA levels. AMPK activity and its phosphorylation state were also unaffected after 5 and 10 min of perfusion in the presence of leptin. The addition of insulin (100 microunits/ml) to the perfusate reduced the ability of leptin to increase fatty acid oxidation and decrease cardiac TG content. These data demonstrate for the first time that leptin activates fatty acid oxidation and decreases TG content in the heart. We also show that the effects of leptin in the heart are independent of changes in the AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoA axis.

Della-Fera M.A. Martin R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 105-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence now suggests that leptin can also regulate energy homeostasis through direct actions on peripheral lipid and glucose metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 3Hynes G.R. Jones P.J.H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, leptin partitions fatty acids toward fatty acid oxidation rather than TG1 storage. For instance, in vivo elevation of leptin levels in normal rats leads to a depletion of TG content in liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas without an increase in plasma fatty acids or ketones, suggesting intracellular oxidation (4Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Furthermore, leptin treatment of isolated muscle results in increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased incorporation of fatty acids into TG (5Muoio D.M. Dohm G.L. Fiedorek F.T., Jr. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muoio D.M. Dohm G.L. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E913-E921PubMed Google Scholar, 7Steinberg G.R. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1374-E1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which leptin increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases TG content in peripheral tissues is not completely understood. Recently, leptin was suggested to acutely increase fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 415: 339-343Crossref Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Fatty acid oxidation is a key source of energy for the heart and normally produces the major source of ATP to sustain contractile function. AMPK has a key role as a fuel gauge in the heart and plays an important role in regulating fatty acid oxidation (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 10Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation by AMPK occurs through the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (10Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACC produces malonyl-CoA, which potently inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (11McGarry J.D. Stark M.J. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8291-8293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of cardiac AMPK reduces ACC activity, lowers malonyl-CoA levels, and stimulates fatty acid oxidation (12Kudo N. Gillespie J.G. Kung L. Witters L.A. Schulz R. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17513-17520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of AMPK increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases fatty acid incorporation into TG in liver and skeletal muscle (14Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although leptin receptors are present in the heart (15Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6093-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), it is not known whether leptin mediates cardiac fatty acid metabolism or whether leptin can modify the AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoA axis in the heart. Fatty acids and glucose are supplied to the heart exogenously from the plasma or endogenously from TG or glycogen stores. Increasing the insulin concentration switches the substrate preference of the heart away from fatty acids and toward glucose utilization (16Neely J.R. Morgan H.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1974; 36: 415-439Crossref Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that leptin and insulin signaling pathways interact (17Carvalheira J.B.C. Siloto R.M.P. Ignacchitti I.

Furthermore, leptin has been shown to oppose the effects of insulin on fatty acid partitioning in muscle (6Muoio D.M. Dohm G.L. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E913-E921PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to delineate whether leptin directly affects cardiac FA metabolism and function in isolated working rat hearts. We further investigated the potential role of the AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoA axis in the regulation of cardiac FA metabolism by leptin. Finally, we investigated whether the presence of insulin influenced leptin action on cardiac FA metabolism. Isolated working hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to an aerobic perfusion with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 5 mmol/liter glucose, 0.8 mmol/liter palmitate, 3% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm free Ca2+, in the absence or presence of 100 microunits/ml insulin. Spontaneously beating hearts were perfused at an 11.5 mm Hg left atrial preload and an 80 mm Hg aortic afterload. Heart rate, peak systolic pressure, aortic developed pressure, cardiac output, aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac work, and oxygen consumption were measured as described previously (23Lopaschuk G.D. Barr R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The hearts, in which fatty acid oxidation and glucose oxidation rates were measured, were subjected to a 60-min perfusion in perfusate containing [9,10-3H]palmitate and [1-14C]glucose (23Lopaschuk G.D. Barr R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Leptin (60 ng/ml or 3.8 nmol/liter) or vehicle was added 5 min into the perfusion period. Palmitate and glucose oxidation rates were determined simultaneously by quantitative collection of 3H2O and14CO2 produced by the heart, as described previously (23Lopaschuk G.D. Barr R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Steady-state oxidation rates were calculated from the linear time course as the mean of nanomoles of [3H]palmitate·g dry−1·min−1or [14C]glucose·g dry−1·min−1 for each 10-min sampling time point during the 60-min perfusion. The rate of acetyl-CoA production from tricarboxylic acid cycle activity was calculated as described previously (23Lopaschuk G.D. Barr R.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cardiac efficiency was defined as the ratio of cardiac work to the rate of tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA produced. Shorter perfusion protocols were also performed under identical perfusate conditions as above. The perfusion protocol consisted of a 20-min period of aerobic perfusion to allow for stabilization, followed by the addition of leptin (60 ng/ml or 3.8 nmol/liter) or vehicle and a subsequent 5- or 10-min perfusion period. Hearts were then rapidly frozen at the end of the 5- or 10-min perfusion for biochemical analysis. TG was extracted from heart tissue according to the method of Folch (24Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 mg of frozen heart tissue was extracted in a 20-fold volume of 2:1 chloroform:methanol, following which 0.2 volume of methanol was added and the extract vortexed for 30 s. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1100 × g for 10 min and the supernatant collected. 0.2 volume of 0.04% CaCl2 was added to the supernatant and then centrifuged at 550 × g for 20 min. The upper phase was then removed, and the interface was washed three times with pure solvent upper phase consisting of 1.5 ml of chloroform, 24.0 ml of methanol, and 23.5 ml of water. The final wash was removed, and 50 μl of methanol was added to obtain one phase. The samples were then dried under N2 at 60 °C and redissolved in 50 μl of 3:2tert-butyl alcohol:Triton X-100 (25Danno H. Jincho Y. Budiyanto S. Furukawa Y. Kimura S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1992; 38: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cardiac TG was then quantitated colorimetrically as glycerol using an enzymatic assay (Wako® Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). To determine palmitate incorporation into TG, an aliquot of the total cardiac TG was resuspended in 4 ml of scintillation fluid and then counted for the presence of radiolabeled [3H]palmitate. Total (exogenous and endogenous) FA oxidation was determined by the following equation: [total [3H]palmitate label incorporation into TG during the perfusion] + [the change in fatty acid content in TG during the perfusion] + [total [3H]palmitate oxidized during the perfusion]. This calculation makes the following assumptions: 1) TG pool size was similar in control and leptin-treated hearts at the onset of leptin administration; 2) the TG pool size remains constant in the control hearts throughout the perfusion period, which we have shown to occur under these perfusion conditions (26Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 3) the amount of [3H]palmitate label entering the TG pool equals that of endogenous or unlabelled fatty acid leaving the pool; and 4) all palmitate released from the TG pool is oxidized. Previous studies of TG turnover and the contribution of TG to energy substrate utilization in isolated working rat hearts demonstrate that these assumptions are valid (26Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3825-3831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cytosolic fraction containing ACC and AMPK was isolated from frozen tissue according to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method (13Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17513-17520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Protein content was measured using the Bradford protein assay. The “CO2 fixation technique” was used to measure ACC activity in the 6% PEG fraction (13Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17513-17520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). AMPK activity of the 6% PEG precipitate was measured by following the incorporation of32P into the synthetic AMARAASAAALARRR (AMARA) peptide (13Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17513-17520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 mg of frozen tissue was extracted in 200 μl of 6% perchloric acid containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (to prevent oxidation during isolation). Following homogenization, samples were left on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 13,400 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and subjected to HPLC analysis as described previously (28King M.T. Reiss P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whole cell homogenates were obtained by homogenizing 50 mg of frozen heart tissue in homogenization buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C), 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% w/v glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% sodium azide, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After homogenization for 30 s, the mixture was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was used for immunoblotting. Protein content was measured using the Bradford protein assay. Samples were diluted in protein sample buffer, and 50 μg of protein was loaded onto 9% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels. Samples were resolved and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween and then incubated with phospho-AMPK (Thr-172) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The membranes were subsequently incubated in goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized using the ECL® Western blot detection kit. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean. The data were analyzed with the statistical program Instat 2.01®. An unpaired Student'st test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between the control and leptin-treated groups. Two-tailed values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. The effect of leptin (60 ng/ml or 3.8 mmol/liter) on cardiac function in isolated working rat hearts subjected to a 60-min period of aerobic perfusion is shown in Table I. This concentration of leptin had no significant effect on heart rate, peak systolic pressure, cardiac output, or cardiac work compared with control hearts. Heart function was stable in both groups throughout the perfusion period and did not differ in any parameter between 5 and 60 min of perfusion (data not shown).Table IThe effect of leptin on mechanical function of isolated working rat heartsControl (n = 7)Leptin (n = 6)Heart rate (beats · min−1)228 ± 10244 ± 8Peak systolic pressure (mm Hg)128 ± 8118 ± 3HR × PSP (beats · min−1 · mm Hg−1 · 10−3)29 ± 129 ± 1Cardiac output (ml · min−1)54 ± 360 ± 4Cardiac work (ml · mm Hg · min−1 · 10−2)69 ± 571 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Cumulative palmitate oxidation increased linearly over the 60-min perfusion period in both the control and leptin-treated hearts (data not shown). As demonstrated in Fig.1A, leptin significantly increased steady-state palmitate oxidation rates 60% above control levels. Total palmitate uptake ([3H]palmitate oxidized + [3H]palmitate incorporated into TG) into the heart was also significantly increased in the leptin-treated hearts compared with the control hearts (99 ± 7 versus 68 ± 5 μmol·g dry weight−1). However, leptin had no effect on glucose oxidation rates in these hearts (Fig. 1B). Leptin also significantly reduced cardiac TG content to 75% the level of control hearts by the end of the 60-min perfusion period (Fig.2A). To investigate whether the leptin-induced decrease in TG content was the result of decreased incorporation of fatty acid into TG or increased TG lipolysis, we also determined the amount of [3H]palmitate incorporated into the cardiac TG pool during the perfusion (Fig. 2B). Leptin had no significant effect on the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into TG compared with control hearts, suggesting that the leptin-induced decrease in TG content was caused by an increased rate of TG lipolysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that myocardial TG lipolysis provides an important source of fatty acids for oxidative metabolism (26Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because leptin treatment reduced TG content, total fatty acid oxidation rates must take into account the exogenous palmitate oxidized as well as the endogenous fatty acid released from TG. Thus, we calculated total fatty acid oxidation using the following equation: [total [3H]palmitate label incorporation into TG during the perfusion] + [the change in fatty acid content in TG during the perfusion] + [total [3H]palmitate oxidized during the perfusion]. This calculation makes the following assumptions: 1) the TG pool size was similar in control and leptin-treated hearts at the onset of leptin administration; 2) the TG pool size remains constant in the control hearts throughout the perfusion period, which we have shown to occur under these perfusion conditions (26Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 3) the amount of [3H]palmitate label entering the TG pool equals that of endogenous or unlabelled fatty acid leaving the pool; and 4) all palmitate released from the TG pool is oxidized. Previous studies of TG turnover and the contribution of TG to energy substrate utilization in isolated working hearts demonstrate that these assumptions are valid (26Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3825-3831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the above calculation to determine total fatty acid oxidation, we show that hearts exposed to leptin have total fatty acid oxidation rates that were 82% above control hearts (Fig.3A). The contribution of glucose and both exogenous and endogenous palmitate to tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA production is shown in Fig.3B. Under the perfusion conditions used, fatty acids were the predominant source of tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA in both control and leptin-treated hearts. Leptin treatment resulted in an increase in total tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA production. This increase in tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA production was specifically caused by an increase in fatty acid oxidation, with no change in the contribution from glucose metabolism. The leptin-treated hearts also consumed significantly more oxygen than the control hearts (Fig. 3C). Although cardiac work was unchanged between control and leptin-treated hearts, the leptin-treated hearts exhibited a significant decrease in cardiac efficiency (i.e. cardiac work/tricarboxylic acid cycle acetyl-CoA produced) (Fig.3D). The leptin-induced activation of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle has recently been suggested to be mediated via activation of AMPK (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 415: 339-343Crossref Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). However, as demonstrated in Fig.4A, the leptin-induced activation of fatty acid oxidation in the heart was not accompanied by changes in AMPK activity. We also determined the level of Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK, which is indicative of AMPK activation through its upstream kinase, AMPK kinase (28King M.T. Reiss P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). No difference in the level of Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK was observed between control and leptin-treated hearts (Fig. 4A). Representative immunoblots demonstrate variable levels of Thr-172 phosphorylation in the individual hearts, which correlates directly with the level of AMPK activity. Previous studies have shown that leptin signaling can occur rapidly within minutes (17Carvalheira J.B.C. Siloto R.M.P. Ignacchitti I. Brenelli S.L. Carbalho C.R.O. Leite A. Velloso L.A.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2328-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To determine whether leptin may have resulted in an earlier activation of AMPK, which may have been reversed by the end of the 60-min perfusion period, we determined whether leptin could activate AMPK at earlier time points. However, after exposure of hearts to leptin for 5 min (Fig. 4B) or 10 min (Fig.4C), we were still unable to show any significant difference in AMPK activity or Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPK. We also determined whether leptin had any effects on cardiac ACC activity or malonyl-CoA levels, both of which are established downstream targets of AMPK action (10Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A.

Increased ratios of AMP:ATP are well known to activate AMPK, but neither AMP nor ATP levels were different between control and leptin-treated hearts (data not shown).Table IIThe effect of leptin on cardiac ACC activity and malonyl-CoA levelsControl (n = 7)Leptin (n = 6)ACC activity (nmol · min−1 · mg−1)3.3 ± 0.53.6 ± 0.5Malonyl-CoA (nmol · g dry weight−1)3.1 ± 0.73.1 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab Finally, we investigated whether insulin (100 microunits/ml) had any effect on leptin action in the isolated working rat heart. In hearts perfused with leptin + insulin, no significant effect on the mechanical function was observed compared with hearts perfused with insulin alone (Table III). However, insulin did reduce the leptin-induced activation of exogenous fatty acid oxidation (Table IV). Furthermore, the leptin-induced depletion of cardiac TG was also blocked by insulin (Table IV). Although the presence of insulin significantly increased glucose oxidation rates relative to hearts perfused in the absence of insulin (954 ± 51 compared with 448 ± 51 nmol of [14C]glucose·g dry weight−1·min−1), glucose oxidative rates were not significantly different between insulin and leptin + insulin hearts (Table IV). Finally, we also demonstrate that in hearts perfused with leptin + insulin, there was no difference in AMPK activity, ACC activity, or malonyl-CoA levels compared with insulin alone (Table IV).Table IIIThe effect of leptin + insulin on mechanical function of isolated working rat heartsInsulin (n = 7)Leptin + insulin (n = 6)Heart rate (beats · min−1)239 ± 10246 ± 12Peak systolic pressure (mm Hg)126 ± 5117 ± 4HR × PSP (beats · min−1 · mm Hg−1 · 10−3)30 ± 229 ± 2Cardiac output (ml · min−1)52 ± 453 ± 5Cardiac work (ml · mm Hg · min−1 · 10−2)66 ± 762 ± 8 Open table in a new tab Table IVThe effect of leptin + insulin on oxidative rates, TG content, and AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoAInsulin (n = 7)Leptin + insulin (n = 6)Palmitate oxidation (nmol [3H]palmitate · g dry weight−1 · min−1)1108 ± 2791429 ± 291Glucose oxidation (nmol [14C]glucose · g dry weight−1 · min−1)954 ± 881141 ± 249TG content (μmol · g dry weight−1)22 ± 221 ± 3Palmitate incorporation into TG (μmol · g dry weight−1)6 ± 16 ± 1AMPK activity (pmol · min−1 · mg−1)1133 ± 142941 ± 116ACC activity (nmol · min−1 · mg−1)7.3 ± 0.85.9 ± 1.2Malonyl-CoA (nmol · g dry weight−1)3.8 ± 0.53.3 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab This study demonstrates for the first time that leptin significantly alters cardiac energy metabolism by preferentially increasing fatty acid oxidation rates and stimulating TG lipolysis. Leptin also increases cardiac tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and oxygen consumption in the absence of any effect on contractile function, resulting in a significant reduction in cardiac efficiency. This suggests that leptin can have important actions on cardiac energy production. We also show that the leptin-induced stimulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism does not occur through the activation of the AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoA axis. Finally, we show that insulin can prevent the leptin-induced stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and TG lipolysis. Recently AMPK was identified as the signaling cascade through which leptin activates fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 415: 339-343Crossref Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrate that leptin had no effect on cardiac AMPK activity or AMPK phosphorylation after 5, 10, or 60 min of leptin exposure. After the 60-min perfusion period, there was also no change in the downstream mediators involved in the regulation of cardiac FA oxidation: ACC activity or malonyl-CoA levels. This suggests that, in the heart, leptin can regulate fatty acid oxidation independent of AMPK. The reason why leptin activates AMPK in skeletal muscle and not in heart may be related to differences in AMPK subunit expression and regulation between these tissues. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex comprising an α catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) (29Davies S.P. Hawley S.A. Woods A. Carling D. Haystead T.A.J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 251-357Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). AMPK can be activated through phosphorylation of Thr-172 by AMPK kinase (30Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and creatine:phosphocreatine (Cr:PCr) ratios (32Ponticos M., Lu, Q.L. Morgan J.E. Hardie D.G. Partridge T.A. Carling D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of each subunit have been identified with varying tissue distribution (33Woods A. Cheung P.C.F. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10282-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The α2β2γ1 and α2β2γ2 complexes are highly expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle (29Davies S.P. Hawley S.A. Woods A. Carling D. Haystead T.A.J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 251-357Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Cheung P.C.F. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). However, the α2β2γ3 complex is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle (34Cheung P.C.F. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, direct activation of α2-AMPK by leptin was accompanied by an increase in AMP levels and Thr-172 phosphorylation (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 415: 339-343Crossref Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). However, in isolated working rat hearts, we observed no change in AMP levels or Thr-172 phosphorylation. Although further investigation is required, it is possible that the activation of AMPK by leptin is specific to skeletal muscle and is mediated through the γ3 isoform. Because isoform specific AMPK activity was not determined in this study, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that α2-AMPK activity was increased by leptin. However, if α2-AMPK was activated, changes in Thr-172 phosphorylation, ACC activity, and malonyl-CoA levels would be expected, and these changes were not observed. In the isolated working rat heart, leptin had no significant effect on any measured index of cardiac function (peak systolic pressure, cardiac output, or cardiac work). However, leptin treatment increased myocardial fatty acid oxidation 60% above control hearts and decreased TG content by 33%. Studies of triglyceride turnover in the heart have demonstrated that myocardial TG pools undergo substantial turnover, i.e. continuous lipolysis and synthesis (26Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we determined the amount of [3H]palmitate label in the TG pool and demonstrated that the leptin-induced decrease in TG content was the result of an increase in TG lipolysis rather than a decrease in palmitate incorporation into TG. Previous studies have also demonstrated that myocardial TG lipolysis provides an important source of fatty acids for oxidative metabolism (26Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further determined that the total (exogenous and endogenous) fatty acid oxidation in leptin-treated hearts was elevated 82% above control hearts. Thus, we have demonstrated that leptin increases the oxidation of palmitate derived from exogenous sources as well as from the lipolysis of endogenous myocardial TG. In addition to an increase in fatty acid oxidation, leptin also increased tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, and oxygen consumption. This resulted in a significant decrease in cardiac efficiency in the leptin-treated hearts. One possible explanation for the decrease in cardiac efficiency is a leptin-induced increase in uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and/or UCP3 activity. We did not observe any increases in either UCP2 or UCP3 protein expression (data not shown) but this does not rule out a leptin-induced increase in uncoupling protein activity. Leptin induction of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation has been suggested to be the result of an increase in UCP3 activity (35Steinberg G.R. Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E593-E600Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine whether leptin induces mitochondrial uncoupling by increasing UCP2 and/or UCP3 activity in the heart. The recent classification of obesity as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and characteristic elevated leptin levels in obesity has led to the suggestion that leptin may be the link between obesity and cardiovascular disease (36Leyva F. Godsland I.F. Ghatei M. Proudler A.J. Aldis S. Walton C. Bloom S. Stevenson J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that acute leptin treatment increases myocardial fatty acid oxidation rates and reduces cardiac efficiency. Elevated rates of fatty acid oxidation have previously been demonstrated to reduce cardiac efficiency and the recovery of mechanical function following acute ischemia (37Liu Q. Docherty J.C. Rendell J.C. Clanachan A.S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 39: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although further studies are necessary, it seems likely that long term elevation of plasma leptin levels may result in cardiac dysfunction by stimulating fatty acid oxidation and decreasing cardiac efficiency. In this study we show that the leptin-induced increase in tricarboxylic acid cycle activity is specifically caused by an activation of fatty acid oxidation originating from exogenous palmitate and endogenous TG with no change in the contribution from glucose metabolism. Although elevated rates of fatty acid oxidation are associated with reduced cardiac efficiency as discussed above, they may be important in preventing the “lipotoxicity” or toxic effects associated with TG accumulation (4Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Lee Y. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4637-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 5Muoio D.M. Dohm G.L.

Indeed, in the heart, TG accumulation is associated with depressed contractile function, arrhythmias, hypertrophy, heart failure, and apoptosis (39Zhou Y.-T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M.

The reduction of myocardial TG content by troglitazone treatment results in the normalization of cardiac function (39Zhou Y.-T. Grayburn P. Karim A. Shimabukuro M. Higa M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Thus, elevated leptin levels in obesity may play a protective role in limiting TG accumulation and its associated cardiac dysfunction. However, the potential anti-steatotic benefit of leptin in the heart must be weighed against the elevated rates of fatty acid oxidation and decrease in cardiac efficiency. Several studies have shown that leptin and insulin signaling pathways interact (17Carvalheira J.B.C. Siloto R.M.P. Ignacchitti I. Brenelli S.L. Carbalho C.R.O. Leite A. Velloso L.A. Gontijo J.A.R.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2328-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and, further, that AMPK can be activated by leptin (8Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 415: 339-343Crossref Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) and inhibited by insulin (20Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 284-2867Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Gamble J. Lopaschuk G.D. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1270-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that the leptin-induced activation of fatty acid oxidation and decrease in TG content is reduced by insulin. We also show that acute exposure to leptin does not interfere with the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose metabolism in the heart. The mechanism by which insulin inhibited the actions of leptin is not clear. However, our data do show that insulin reduced the leptin-induced activation of FA oxidation and TG depletion without changes in AMPK activity, ACC activity, or malonyl-CoA levels. Leptin has also been shown to induce reactive oxygen species generation by increasing fatty acid oxidation in aortic endothelial cells through the activation of protein kinase A, which results in the phosphorylation of ACC and a reduction of ACC activity and malonyl-CoA levels (45Yamagishi S.-I. Edelstein D., Du, X.-L. Kaneda Y. Guzman M. Brownlee M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25096-25100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that leptin may be acting through cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation. However, the elevation of cAMP levels in the heart is associated with increases in contractile function that were not observed in the presence of leptin. Furthermore, there was no change in ACC activity or malonyl-CoA levels. Thus, although cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity was not measured, it seems that leptin does not mediate the activation of fatty acid oxidation in the heart through this mechanism. The mechanism by which leptin increases cardiac fatty acid oxidation remains unclear. It is possible, however, that increased mitochondrial uncoupling protein activity may play a role. For example, the leptin-treated hearts had an increase in fatty acid oxidation and oxygen consumption. The induction of mitochondrial uncoupling protein activity has been demonstrated to increase oxygen consumption (46Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Mootha V.K. Slieker L.J. Lowell B.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the induction of fatty acid oxidation by leptin in skeletal muscle has been suggested to be the result of an increase in uncoupling protein activity (35Steinberg G.R. Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E593-E600Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine whether leptin can induce mitochondrial uncoupling activity in the heart and whether the induction of mitochondrial uncoupling activity is responsible for the elevation of fatty acid oxidation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that leptin specifically alters cardiac metabolism by preferentially increasing fatty acid oxidation and TG lipolysis. This occurs independently of changes in the AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoA axis. Leptin also increased myocardial oxygen consumption and significantly reduced cardiac efficiency. Given that elevated rates of fatty acid oxidation and decreased cardiac efficiency can contribute to contractile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, future studies are clearly needed to establish whether leptin is indeed the link between obesity and cardiovascular disease.

A peptide-based pan-caspase inhibitor is neuroprotective against neonatal H-I brain injury, suggesting a central role of caspases in brain injury.

In this study, we explored the neuroprotective effects of a small, reversible caspase-3 inhibitor M826. M826 selectively and potently inhibited both caspase-3 enzymatic activity and apoptosis in cultured cells in vitro. In a rat model of neonatal H-I, M826 blocked caspase-3 activation and cleavage of its substrates, which begins 6 h and peaks 24 h after H-I. Although M826 significantly reduced DNA fragmentation and brain tissue loss, it did not prevent calpain activation in the cortex. This activation, which is associated with excitotoxic/necrotic cell injury, occurred within 30 min to 2 h after H-I even in the presence of M826. Similar to calpain activation, we found evidence of caspase-2 processing within 30 min to 2 h after H-I that was not affected by M826. Caspase-2 processing appeared to be secondary to calpain-mediated cleavage and was not associated with caspase-2 activation.

Previously utilized peptide-based caspase inhibitors (e.g. Boc-D-fmk, z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk) required relatively large doses in vivo for their protective effects, and at high concentrations, their effects are more likely to be less selective. Thus, although these studies suggest a role for caspases, the specific caspases and other proteases, which contribute to brain injury after neonatal H-I, have not been clarified. Caspases are a family of cysteine aspartyl-specific proteases. They are mammalian homologues of CED-3, which is required for programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (17Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2247) Google Scholar). To date, 13 mammalian caspases have been identified that share similarities in amino acid sequence, structure, and biochemical properties (18Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

They are normally expressed as proenzymes (30–50 kDa) comprising an N-terminal prodomain, a large subunit (∼20 kDa), and a small subunit (∼10 kDa).

The apoptotic initiators (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) containing large N-terminal prodomains generally act upstream of small prodomain effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7). Caspase-3, among effector caspases, has been implicated in neuronal apoptosis during normal brain development and in delayed neuronal cell death after brain injury in the developing and adult brain (9Han B.H.

Because caspase-3 is known to be a major contributor to the apoptotic machinery in many cell types, development of selective and potent caspase-3 inhibitors has emerged as a therapeutic target. We have utilized a new small, reversible inhibitor of caspase-3, M826, to determine the role of caspase-3 after neonatal H-I as well as to develop a compound that may have therapeutic potential. M826 demonstrated high selectivity and potency toward caspase-3 in recombinant enzyme-based as well as whole cell-based assays. It also blocked almost all caspase-3 activation and its substrate cleavage after neonatal H-I. Despite this, early excitotoxic/necrotic cell death associated with calpain activation and cleavage but not activation of caspase-2 was still present in caspase-3 inhibitor-treated animals. Our results suggest that caspase-3 contributes to delayed cell death and that early events associated with calpain activation may be involved in the rapidly occurring excitotoxic/necrotic component of cell death after neonatal H-I. M826 (molecular weight, 648), a selective, reversible caspase-3 inhibitor was synthesized and provided by Merck Frosst, Inc. To determine potency and selectivity of M826 against different caspases, enzymatic caspase assays were performed with active, recombinant caspase 1–10 as described previously (21Garcia-Calvo M.

Briefly, caspase subunits were expressed inEscherichia coli, and each caspase was folded by rapid dilution from its corresponding denatured large and small subunits (40Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). After folding, active enzyme was separated from inactive subunit protein by ion-exchange chromatography. The activity of each enzyme was measured using fluorometric assays as described (40Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To test the ability of M826 to inhibit apoptosis in a cell-based assay system, caspase-3 activation was induced by camptothecin (NT2) or etoposide (mouse cerebellar granule neurons (mCGNs) and mouse cortical neurons (mCORTs)) in the presence of various concentrations of M826. Briefly, mCGN cultures were obtained from 7–9-day-old CD-1 mouse pups, and mCORT cultures were obtained from E16-E18 rat fetuses. After trypsin treatment for mCGNs and papain treatment for mCORTs, tissue was triturated, and cells were plated in 96-well microplates coated with poly-d-lysine (VWR) (105 cells/well for mCGNs and 25,000 cells for mCORTs). mCGNs were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) with 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml gentamicin for 6 days, and mCORTs were grown in neurobasal medium and B27 supplement (Invitrogen) for 4–7 days. Etoposide was then added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml with and without different concentrations of M826. After 20 h, cells were harvested, cell lysates were prepared, and a cell death ELISA was performed with a commercially available kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For NT2 cells, 5000 cells were plated/well in 96-well plates. The following day, camptothecin 5 μg/ml plus and minus different concentrations of M826 or other inhibitor were added for 5 h. Cells were then harvested, lysed, and analyzed as above in the dell death ELISA. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats (dam plus 10 pups per litter) were obtained from Sasco Breeders when the pups were 3–4 days of age. The pups were housed with their dam in the home cage under a 12:12-h light:dark cycle with food and water freely available throughout the study. The neonatal H-I brain injury was performed based on the Levine procedure (1Vannucci R.C. Pediatr Res. 1990; 27: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4Levine S. Am. J.

For in vivo studies, either vehicle or compound (3 or 30 nmol in 5 μl of vehicle) was intracerebroventricular (ICV)-injected into the left hemisphere of P7 rats as described previously (12Cheng Y. Deshmukh M. D'Costa A. Demaro J.A. Gidday J.M. Shah A. Sun Y. Jacquin M.F. Johnson E.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1992-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 42Han B.H.

After H-I in P7 rats, tissues from the hippocampus and cortex, both ipsi- and contra-lateral to the ligation, were dissected and frozen in dry ice. Tissue samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Caspase-3-like activity was determined by DEVD-AMC cleavage assay as described previously (9Han B.H. D'Costa A. Back S.A. Parsadanian M. Patel S. Shah A.R. Gidday J.M. Srinivasan A. Deshmukh M.

Caspase-2-like activity was determined using VDVAD-AFC as a caspase-2 substrate. Tissue lysate (10 μl) was incubated in a 96-well plate with 90 μl of assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% Sucrose) containing 30 μm VDVAD-AFC (Calbiochem). The emitted fluorescence was measured every 15 min for 60 min at 37 °C at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 500 nm using a microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). VDVAD-AFC cleavage activity was obtained from the slope by plotting fluorescence units against time. Ac-AFC (Calbiochem) was used to obtain a standard curve, and the enzyme activity was calculated as the pmol of AFC/mg of protein/min. Brain tissue lysates prepared as described above for the caspase assay were subjected to Western blotting. Proteins (40 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) as described previously (9Han B.H. D'Costa A. Back S.A. Parsadanian M. Patel S. Shah A.R.

Blots were then incubated for 2–3 h with primary antibody followed by incubation with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-procaspase-3 at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-active caspase-3 at 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase at 1:200 (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-α-spectrin at 1:2000 (Chemicon), rabbit anti-p35 at 1:1000 (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-caspase-2 (C-20) at 1:100 (Santa Cruz), and goat anti-β-actin used at 1:2000 (Santa Cruz).

Briefly, tissue sections were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% dry milk, and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min and incubated overnight with one of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-active caspase-3 at 1:10,000 (Merck Frosst), rabbit anti-caspase-3 cleaved spectrin p120 at 1:20,000 (Merck Frosst), and rabbit anti-calpain-cleaved spectrin Ab38 (44Roberts-Lewis J.M. Savage M.J. Marcy V.R. Pinsker L.R. Siman R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:50,000. Biotinylated secondary antibodies were then applied to the sections, and Cy3 or tetramethylrhodamine was used to visualize staining using TSA™-direct tyramide signal amplification kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For nuclear counterstaining, the sections were incubated with 10 μm4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 2 min followed by washing with Tris-buffered saline. Slides were cover-slipped with Vectashield mounting media (Vector) and examined with a Nikon fluorescence microscope or Zeiss LSM 5 pascal confocal microscope. Forty-micron brain sections were mounted onto glass slides and dried. DNA fragmentation was detected using a terminal dUTP nick-end labeling apoptosis detection kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instruction. To quantify cell death, DNA fragmentation was assayed using a cell death ELISA kit as described (45Salgame P. Varadhachary A.S. Primiano L.L. Fincke J.E. Muller S. Monestier M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 680-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To assess regional area loss, 1 week after H-I, brain sections were prepared as described above, and damage due to H-I was determined by calculating the amount of surviving tissue in coronal sections as described previously (12Cheng Y. Deshmukh M. D'Costa A. Demaro J.A. Gidday J.M. Shah A. Sun Y. Jacquin M.F. Johnson E.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1992-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,42Han B.H. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5775-5781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, coronal sections from the genu of the corpus callosum to the end of the dorsal hippocampus were stained with cresyl violet as previously described (46Holtzman D.M. Sheldon R.A. Jaffe W. Cheng Y. Ferriero D.F. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cross-sectional areas of the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus in each of eight equally spaced reference planes were photo-scanned, and the area of each brain region was calculated using SigmaScan Pro (Jandel Scientific Software). The sections utilized for quantification corresponded approximately to plates 12, 15, 17, 20, 23, 28, 31, and 34 in the rat brain atlas (47Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2 Ed. Academic Press Ltd., Sydney, Australia1986Google Scholar). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Dunn's multiple comparison method with significance set at p < 0.05 unless otherwise stated. The structure of M826 (molecular weight, 648) is shown in Fig. 1. Utilizing recombinant, activated caspases, we determined the potency and selectivity of M826 to different caspases (Table I). M826 inhibited caspase-3 activity at a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 5 nm. It also inhibited enzymatic activity of caspase-7 that has similar protein structure and substrate specificity to caspase-3 (21Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W.

We compared the potency of M826 to that of peptide caspase inhibitors in an enzyme assay system with brain tissue lysates after neonatal H-I that contained active caspase-3. M826 was 50–1000-fold more potent than the peptide-based caspase-3 inhibitors, z-DEVD-fmk, z-VAD-fmk, and Boc-D-fmk (data not shown). We then tested the ability of M826 to inhibit apoptosis in a cell-based assay system in which caspase-3-dependent cell death occurs. M826 potently inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by camptothecin or etoposide in cell cultures with an IC50 of 30–120 nm (Table II). As a comparison, z-VAD-fmk had an IC50 of 1 μm for inhibiting DNA fragmentation induced by camptothecin in NT2 cells. Because we were unable to test the potency of M826 against recombinant activated caspase-9, we assessed whether M826 could block the formation of the large and small subunits of caspase-3 in NT2 cells treated with camptothecin. This cleavage is mediated by activated caspase-9. Despite the ability of M826 to potently inhibit caspase-3 activation, high concentrations of M826 (>1 μm) did not block the cleavage of pro-caspase-3 between the large and small subunit (data not shown).Table ISelective inhibition of caspase-3/7 activity by M826Recombinant caspaseIC5010.052>1030.00540.350.261.770.0182.19NT1017.7 Open table in a new tab Table IIInhibition of DNA fragmentation by M826 in cultured cellsCell typesIC50NT20.03mGCN0.05mCORT0.12 Open table in a new tab To evaluate the effects of the selective caspase-3 inhibitor, M826, on caspase-3 activation and its downstream effects, we first determined the concentration of M826 present in the brain after direct ICV administration. M826 (30 nmol) was injected ICV into the left hemisphere of P7 rats, and concentrations of the compound were analyzed (Fig. 2A). M826 was detectable bilaterally in the cortex with a similar time course profile. The brain concentration 24 h after ICV injection remained greater than 1 μm. To test the ability of M826 to inhibit caspase-3 activity after H-I, P7 rats were ICV-injected with either vehicle or M826 immediately before exposure to hypoxia (2 h after the carotid ligation), and then caspase-3 activity in the brain was assessed 24 h after H-I. Consistent with previous results (9Han B.H. D'Costa A. Back S.A. Parsadanian M. Patel S. Shah A.R. Gidday J.M. Srinivasan A. Deshmukh M. Holtzman D.M. Neurobiol.

A single ICV injection of M826 completely blocked H-I-induced caspase-3 activation. When given immediately after H-I, M826 (3 or 30 nmol) also blocked most caspase-3 activation at 24 and 48 h post-H-I (Fig.2C). To test whether caspase-3 inhibition by M826 results in neuroprotection against neonatal H-I brain injury, different measures of cell death were assessed (Fig. 3). We first utilized an ELISA assay that quantitatively detects DNA fragmentation (45Salgame P. Varadhachary A.S. Primiano L.L. Fincke J.E. Muller S. Monestier M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 680-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). M826 significantly reduced chromosomal DNA cleavage by ∼30% as compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 3A). We next investigated whether other indicators of tissue injury were affected by M826. Consistent with the ELISA assay, there was a clear decrease in the number of terminal dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells in M826versus vehicle-treated ani"

MMPs are important enzymes for the proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, proteoglycan, elastin, laminin, and fibronectin (4Johnson L.L. Dyer R. Hupe D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). MMPs are synthesized as preproenzymes, and most of them are secreted from the cells as proenzymes. Among previously reported human MMPs, MMP-2 (gelatinase A/Mr 72,000 type IV collagenase) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B/Mr 92,000 type IV collagenase) are thought to be key enzymes for degrading type IV collagen, which is a major component of the basement membrane (3Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are abundantly expressed in various malignant tumors (5Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Romer J. Almholt K. Dano K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and contribute to invasion and metastasis (6Liabakk N.B. Talbot I. Smith R.A. Wilkinson K. Balkwill F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 190-196PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-2 can be activated by several mechanisms dependent on stimulators and cell types. Initially, pro-MMP-2 can be activated by the action of highly expressed MT1-MMP and the adequate expression of TIMP-2 (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 8Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar, 9Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Beliveau R. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this situation, the balance between MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 is important. At low concentrations, TIMP-2 binds to the catalytic site of some activated MT1-MMP molecules, generating receptors for pro-MMP-2, thereby promoting MMP-2 activation. In this situation, MT1-MMP forms a homophilic complex through the hemopexin-like domain that acts as a mechanism to keep MT1-MMP molecules close together to facilitate pro-MMP-2 activation (10Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). At high concentrations, TIMP-2 binds and inhibits any active MT1-MMP, thus completely preventing MMP-2 activation. Next, the down-regulation of TIMP-2 by type IV collagen without affecting MT1-MMP can lead to pro-MMP-2 activation (11Maquoi E. Frankenne F. Noel A. Krell H.W. Grams F. Foidart J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this case, pro-MMP-2 activation involved neither a transcriptional modulation of MMP-2, MT1-MMP, or TIMP-2 expression nor any alteration of MT1-MMP protein synthesis or processing. Finally, activation of pro-MMP-2 in fibroblast culture in a type I collagen lattice was induced intracellularly and is associated with Golgi-enriched intracellular membranes without the help of MT1-MMP (12Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Collier M., Li, L. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in aging and many diseases as follows: cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, neurological degeneration, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. However, there are few reports on what kinds of ROS and how ROS affect tumor cell invasion. In particular, the specific mechanism of transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP expression has not yet been understood. Here we report that sustained exposure of H2O2, not a one time exposure of H2O2, to cells increases pro-MMP-2 activation through the induction of MT1-MMP expression, and this activation is mediated via a receptor tyrosine kinases/PI3-kinase/NF-κB activation. The sustained production of H2O2 also increased cell motility and invasion but decreased cell-cell interaction. HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), T98G (glioblastoma), and NIH3T3 (mouse fibroblast) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 50 mg/liter gentamicin (Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Human endothelial cells were grown in endothelial cell growth media (Clonetics). Peroxynitrite, hydrogen peroxide, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), Gö6976, indomethacin, SB203580, FPTI III, quinacrine, PD98059, H7, PDTC, NF-κB SN50, rapamycin, LY294002, AG1024, AG1295, AG1478, SU1498, and SU5402 were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-MT1-MMP antibody, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, phenazine methosulfate (PMS), paraquat, dihydroethidium, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DDC), and benzoic acid were obtained from Sigma. Purified pro-MMP-2 protein and anti-MMP-2 antibodies were obtained from Chemicon. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PDGF receptor β antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All experiments, including zymography, were performed in the absence of serum. Enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assayed by gelatin zymography (13Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on a gelatin containing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5% Triton X-100), followed by a brief rinsing in washing buffer without Triton X-100. The gel was incubated with incubation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1 μmZnCl2) at 37 °C. After incubation, the gel was stained and destained. In this gel, a clear zone of gelatin digestion appeared, indicating the presence of MMP. Cell proliferation assay was performed using [3H]thymidine incorporation method. Cells were plated on 6 wells and incubated. At 70–80% confluency, cells were treated with various agents, and 12 h later, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (AmershamBiosciences) was added to each well and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4) and lysed with 0.4m NaOH. The radioactivity incorporated in the cells was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Western blot analysis for MMP-2 and phosphotyrosine protein was performed. For MMP-2, conditioned media were collected and concentrated using Centricon (Millipore). Phosphotyrosine proteins were identified using cell lysate. Briefly, samples were resuspended in reducing 5× sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to Hybond-ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were then blocked with a TTBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and probed with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase. Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (AmershamBiosciences). 5 × 104 cells/chamber were used for each invasion assay. The lower and upper parts of Transwell (Corning Glass) were coated with 10 μl of type I collagen (0.5 mg/ml) and 20 μl of 1:2 mixture of Matrigel:DMEM, respectively. Cells were plated on the Matrigel-coated Transwell. The medium of the lower chambers also contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The inserts were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The cells that had invaded the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Random fields were counted under a light microscope. To determine the effect of the agents on cell motility, cells were seeded into Transwell on membrane filters coated with 10 μl of type I collagen (0.5 mg/ml) at the bottom of the membrane. Migration in the absence or presence of agents was measured as described in the invasion assay. In addition to this, cell motility was measured using a wound-healing method. Briefly, cells were grown to near-confluency, and a wound was created with the blunt end of a yellow tip. This was documented through time-lapse photography. MMP activity was measured using MMP substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)-Ala-Ala-Arg amide, Sigma). Briefly, media were mixed with substrate and incubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer with excitation at 325 nm and emission at 395 nm. MT1-MMP promoter region (−788 to +52) was PCR-amplified and inserted upstream of the pGL3 luciferase basic vector (Promega). NF-κB reporter vectors were purchased from CLONTECH. IκB-α vector was provided by Dr. V. Imbert (Faculte de Medecine, France). HT1080 cells were plated in 6 wells and incubated at 37 °C. At 70–80% confluency, the cells were washed with DMEM and incubated with DMEM without serum and antibiotics for 5 h. 2 μg of reporter vector and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase vector were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using O-nitrophenyl β-galactopyranoside as a substrate. HT1080 cells were plated in 24 wells and incubated at 37 °C to 100% confluency. Other HT1080 cells were radiolabeled with [3H]thymidine overnight and trypsinized. Radiolabeled cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and added to the unlabeled attached 100% confluent 24 wells. After 1–2 h of incubation, nonadherent cells were collected. Then plates were rinsed with PBS, which was collected in the same container. Following this procedure, bound cells were trypsinized completely and collected in other containers. Radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter, and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated. 24-Well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml of type I collagen or type IV collagen. Nonspecific binding was blocked by PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were radiolabeled with [3H]thymidine overnight and trypsinized. Cells were then plated on coated culture plates and incubated for 30 min. Nonadherent and adherent cells were collected and counted. The percentage of adherent cells was calculated as described in the cell-cell adhesion assay. Total cellular RNA was purified from cultured cells using TRIreagent (Molecular Research Center). For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing 37% formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer. The membrane was fixed using an optimized UV cross-linking procedure. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 68 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). cDNA probes for MMPs, TIMPs, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) using a random primer kit (Takara, Japan). The blot was then washed twice with 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.05% SDS at 25 °C, and 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 55 °C in order, and autoradiographed at −70 °C. Cells were plated onto a Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nunc). When cells reached 70–80% confluency, PMS was treated. After incubation, cells were treated with DCFH-DA (5 μm) or dihydroethidium (5 μm) for the detection of H2O2 and superoxide anion amount, respectively. Cells were then wash with PBS and subjected to confocal microscopy (Zeiss). Cytochrome c reduction was used to assess the superoxide production by PMS. Cells were washed once with sodium phosphate buffer (2.35 g/liter NaHPO4/7.61 g/liter Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and incubated with medium containing 1 g/liter glucose, 0.2 g/liter CaCl2, 4.54 g/liter NaCl, 0.37 g/liter KCl in sodium phosphate buffer with 20 μm cytochrome c at 37 °C. The absorbance of the medium was read spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. Flow cytometric analysis for the measuring the amount of intracellular H2O2 was performed. Briefly, cells were incubated with DCFH-DA (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. After washing with PBS, 10 μl of propidium iodide (2.5 mg/ml) was added, and the amount of H2O2was measured by a flow cytometer. To find the ROS effects on cell viability and pro-MMPs activation in HT1080 cells, various ROS were treated in the cells. Cell viability was tested by a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, and MMP expression levels were identified by a gelatin zymography. Both noncytotoxic and cytotoxic concentrations of H2O2 (Fig.1A), peroxynitrite (Fig.1B), and SNP (nitric oxide production, Fig. 1C) treatments did not induce pro-MMPs activation. But H2O2 above 50 μm increased pro-MMPs production (Fig. 1A), whereas peroxynitrite decreased it in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1B). SNP did not induce much change in pro-MMPs level (Fig.1C). We further tested the effect of a well known superoxide anion-generating agent, PMS, on cell proliferation and MMPs expression. Non-cytotoxic concentration of PMS induced pro-MMP-2 activation, but not pro-MMP-9, whereas cytotoxic concentration of PMS decreased pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 expressions and did not induce pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 1D). To identify whether the activated MMP was MMP-2, a Western blot analysis was performed using anti-MMP-2 antibody. Fig. 1E shows that PMS induces pro-MMP-2 activation. To find the direct effects of ROS on pro-MMP activation, ROS and ROS generating agents were added to conditioned media, which were preincubated with HT1080 cells for 2 days and then collected. Both low and high concentrations of H2O2, peroxynitrite, and SNP treatments did not affect pro-MMPs activation (data not shown). Cells were incubated with PMS for various times. PMS induced pro-MMP-2 activation about 48 h after treatment (Fig.2A). Menadione and paraquat, which produce intracellular superoxide anion like PMS, also induced pro-MMP-2 activation but did not affect pro-MMP-9 expression and activation (Fig. 2B). MMP-2 activity was also measured using the substrate, and it was found that PMS-, menadione-, and paraquat-treated groups showed higher MMP-2 activity than the untreated group (Fig. 2C). PMS produces superoxide anion in cells, and this can be converted into H2O2, hydroxyl radical, and H2O by enzymes or metals. What kinds of ROS are involved in pro-MMP-2 activation? To determine this, the cells were treated with DDC, a potent superoxide dismutase inhibitor, which has been proven to increase superoxide anion but decrease H2O2 (14Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 15Siwik D.A. Tzortzis J.D. Pimental D.R. Chang D.L. Pagano P.J. Singh K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 16Brenneisen P. Briviba K. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PMS did not induce pro-MMP-2 activation in the presence of DDC (Fig. 2D), which means that superoxide anion is not involved in pro-MMP-2 activation. Further experiments were done using hydroxyl radical scavengers, benzoic acid, mannitol, and Me2SO. Several times treatment with these agents did not prevent pro-MMP-2 activation by PMS (Fig.2E). The widely used antioxidant N-acetylcysteine was effective in inhibiting pro-MMP-2 activation by PMS (Fig.2E). These results suggest that H2O2is responsible for pro-MMP-2 activation but not superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical. Direct treatment with H2O2did not induce pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 1A), but intracellular H2O2 produced by PMS activated pro-MMP-2. To find the differences between the two sources, intracellular and extracellular ROS levels were measured by several methods. Dihydroethidium and DCFH-DA are specific dyes used for the detection of superoxide anion and H2O2, respectively. Direct treatment with H2O2 did not last over 2 h (data not shown), whereas treatment with PMS increased intracellular superoxide anion (Fig.3A) and H2O2 (Fig. 3B) for 2 days after the treatment, which was identified by a confocal microscopy. For the more precise detection of intracellular superoxide anion and H2O2, flow cytometry analysis was used. As shown in Fig. 3C, intracellular H2O2increased time-dependently, and a similar result was obtained in the case of intracellular superoxide anion, which was measured by a flow cytometer using dihydroethidium (data not shown). Extracellular superoxide anion production by PMS was measured using cytochrome c reduction, and a high level of this anion was present up to 2 days after treatment (Fig. 3D). To discover what kinds of changes by PMS induced pro-MMP-2 activation, mRNA levels of MMPs and TIMPs were investigated. As shown in Fig.4, PMS increased MT1-MMP mRNA. This increased level was continued 60 h after treatment, demonstrating that the sustained production of H2O2stimulates continuous induction of MT1-MMP but does not affect MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 levels significantly. To find the mechanisms for pro-MMP-2 activation by PMS, various inhibitors of cell signal molecules were used. Appropriate concentrations of inhibitors were determined, and it was found that inhibitors themselves did not affect pro-MMP-2 activation (data not shown). Gö6976 (calcium-dependent protein kinase C inhibitor), indomethacin (phospholipase A2 inhibitor, cyclooxygenase inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), FPTI III (Ras processing inhibitor), quinacrine (Mepacrine, phospholipase A2 inhibitor), PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) pathway inhibitor), and H7 (broad serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, protein kinase A inhibitor, protein kinase C inhibitor, and protein kinase G inhibitor) did not have any inhibitory effect on pro-MMP-2 activation by PMS (Fig.5A). These inhibitors were treated twice during incubation, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Further experiments were performed using LY294002 (a PI3-kinase inhibitor) and rapamycin (a Akt/mTOR-p70S6Kinhibitor). Treatment with LY294002 blocked pro-MMP-2 activation, whereas rapamycin did not show any effect (Fig. 5B). Because PMS-induced pro-MMP-2 activation is processed by MT1-MMP induction, a further experiment was done using a MT1-MMP promoter containing reporter vectors. Wild type p85 (PI3-K subunit) overexpression increased MT1-MMP promoter activity, whereas kinase-dead p85 overexpression decreased the promoter activity (Fig.5C). Genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) inhibited pro-MMP-2 activation as well as pro-MMP-2 expression, whereas treatment with both vanadate (a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) and PMS led to increased activation of pro-MMP-2 to 62 kDa and a further 43 kDa (Fig.6A). These results suggest that the protein tyrosine kinase pathway plays a major role in pro-MMP-2 activation by the sustained production of H2O2. To confirm the inhibitory role of genistein in pro-MMP-2 activation, a Northern blot analysis was performed. Genistein decreased transcription levels of MT1-MMP as well as MMP-2 but did not significantly alter the TIMP-2 level (Fig.6B). To find which tyrosine kinase was involved in PMS-induced pro-MMP-2 activation, total cell extracts were electrophoresed, and Western blotting was performed using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 6C, the amount of high molecular weight phosphotyrosine proteins increased with time, but the low molecular weight phosphotyrosine proteins decreased or did not change. High molecular weight tyrosine kinases are generally receptor tyrosine kinases, so that various receptor kinases inhibitors were treated before PMS treatment. As shown in Fig.7A, 0.5 μmAG1295 (a PDGF pathway inhibitor) inhibited pro-MMP-2 activation marginally, but 1 and 5 μm AG1295 inhibited it over 75–85%. SU1498 (a VEGF pathway inhibitor) inhibited it about 20–30%, and 10 μm SU5402 (a fibroblast growth factor pathway inhibitor) showed minimal inhibitory effect on pro-MMP-2 activation, but AG1024 (insulin-like growth factor -1 and insulin pathway inhibitor) and AG1478 (an epidermal growth factor pathway inhibitor) did not inhibit PMS-induced pro-MMP-2 activation. To confirm the PDGF receptor-dependent activation of pro-MMP-2 activation by PMS, the amount of phosphorylated PDGF receptor was measured. As shown in Fig. 7B, PMS increased PDGF receptor phosphorylation. AG1295 also decreased MT1-MMP promoter activity (Fig. 7C). The receptor tyrosine kinases/PI3-K pathway generally induces NF-κB activation. To conclude if this is the case in PMS-induced pro-MMP-2 activation, NF-κB inhibitors were used. PDTC (general inhibitor) and NF-κB SN50 (specific inhibitor peptide) blocked PMS-induced pro-MMP-2 activation, but NF-κB SN50N (inactive control for SN50) was not effective (Fig.8A). Further studies were performed using NF-κB subunit p65 vector and inhibitory unit IκB-α vector. As shown in Fig. 8B, p65 vector overexpression increased MT1-MMP promoter activity, whereas IκB-α overexpression decreased the promoter activity. Furthermore, genistein and AG1295 decreased NF-κB activity induced by PMS (Fig.8C). To investigate whether PMS-induced pro-MMP-2 activation is universal to other cells, T98G and NIH3T3, which produce pro-MMP-2, were treated with PMS. PMS did not induce pro-MMP-2 activation in these cells (Fig.9A). Three days of incubation with PMS showed the same results (data not shown). Transcriptional levels of MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and TIMP-2 were measured by Northern blotting. T98G cells expressed MMP-2 more than HT1080 cells, and NIH3T3 cells produced comparable amounts of MMP-2 to that of the HT1080 cells (Fig. 9B). Levels of TIMP-2 were similar among the three cells. However, NIH3T3 and T98G cells showed a minimal expression of MT1-MMP compared with HT1080. To prove whether these cells express or do not express MT1-MMP, a blotted membrane was exposed for several days, and the MT1-MMP band was detected (data not shown), indicating that these cells express very low amounts of MT1-MMP. NIH3T3 cells were then treated with PMS, and the mRNA level of MT1-MMP was measured by Northern blotting. Although it required a very long exposure time for the detection of the low amount of MT1-MMP expression, the MT1-MMP level in NIH3T3 cells increased over time (Fig. 9C) like HT1080 cells (Fig. 4). We further tested the pro-MMP-2 activation using human endothelial cells that produce a large amount of MT1-MMP. PMS induced pro-MMP-2 activation in endothelial cells (Fig.9D). To find whether PMS affects cell-cell interaction or not, PMS was pretreated or treated at the assay time. HT1080 cells pretreated for 24 h with PMS showed a decrease in the cell-cell interaction by 50%, but cells treated with PMS during the processing time of the assay showed no change (Fig.10A). PMS had no influence on cell-collagen interaction irrespective of preincubation (Fig.10B). Treatment with PMS increased cell motility through Transwell (Fig. 10C) and spreading onto plasticware (Fig.10D). DDC inhibited the cell motility induced by PMS (Fig.10, C and D). PMS also increased cell invasion, which was inhibited by DDC, but treatment with various concentrations of H2O2 did not affect cell invasion (Fig.10E). ROS are produced by a variety of sources, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, ionizing radiation exposures, cytokines, growth factors, metabolism of exogenous compounds, and pathological metabolic processes. These ROS are involved in many natural and pathological processes, including aging, cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, neurological degeneration, angiogenesis, and metastasis (17Shackelford R.E. Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Metastasis requires several sequential steps as described earlier, and a rate-limiting step is degradation of matrix by active MMP-2 and MMP-9 (2Chang C. Werb Z. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S37-S43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Overproduction of the proenzyme was not sufficient for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype as only activated MMPs can degrade the matrix. However, there are few reports on specific mechanisms of MMPs activation and transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP expression. Here we try to elucidate what kinds of ROS and how ROS regulate pro-MMPs activation and MT1-MMP expression. To our knowledge, this is the first described intercellular regulation of MT1-MMP by ROS. PMS and paraquat have been used as superoxide anion-producing agents (14Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Copin J.C. Gasche Y., Li, Y. Chan P.H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 20Marsh J.P. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 167-173PubMed Google Scholar). PMS increased pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 2), cell motility, and the invasion of cancer cells (Fig. 10), but treatment with H2O2, peroxynitrite, and SNP (nitric oxide production) did not have an influence on the activation of MMPs and the tumor invasion. The produced superoxide anion turns into H2O2 by superoxide dismutase and is further catalyzed to H2O by catalase and glutathione peroxidase or hydroxyl radical by metal ions, such as iron. As shown in Fig. 2, H2O2 is responsible for pro-MMP-2 activation, raising an important question. Why did direct H2O2 treatment and PMS-induced H2O2 show different results? As shown in Fig.3, PMS increased intracellular and extracellular superoxide and H2O2 even 48 h after treatment, but one time treatment with H2O2 did not sustain intracellular H2O2 over 2 h, which was assayed by a flow cytometric analysis using DCFH-DA (data not shown). Regulation of MMP-9 expression is well established, but mechanistic processes of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expressions and activation of pro-MMP-2 by ROS are not well understood. MMP-9 expression is regulated by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, protein kinase C, and Ras pathway, dependent on cell types (3Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). It has been shown that noncytotoxic H2O2 acts as an intracellular messenger and activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Ras, tyrosine kinases, and various other kinds of signal molecules (21Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kwon J. Sci. STKE. 2000; stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/53/pe1PubMed Google Scholar,22Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M., Xu, Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). To find the exact mechanism for H2O2-induced pro-MMP-2 activation, various kinds of inhibitors were treated. In contrast to MMP-9 expression, pro-MMP-2 activation by PMS was not affected by mitogen-activated protein kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, protein kinase G, Ras, and phospholipase A2 (Fig.5A). However, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 6A) through MT1-MMP down-regulation (Fig. 6B), and specifically PDGF and VEGF receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, were involved in PMS action about 75–85 and 20–30%, respectively (Fig. 7A). In addition, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor plus PMS increased more pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, it was found that PI3-kinase (Fig. 5) and NF-κB activations (Fig. 8) are also involved in a signal pathway of pro-MMP-2 activation through induction of MT1-MMP expression. It is well established that growth factors induce PI3-K activation, and in turn NF-κB activation (23Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4100) Google Scholar), especially PDGF activates NF-κB through Ras and PI3-K (24Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 25Marumo T. Schini-Kerth V.B. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In our studies, the Ras inhibitor did not reduce pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 5A). It is shown that HT1080 cells express PDGF and the PDGF receptor (26Gupta S. Stuffrein S. Plattner R. Tencati M. Gray C. Whang Y.E. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5846-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the PDGF/PI3-K/NF-κB pathway plays a key role in pro-MMP-2 activation through MT1-MMP induction by the sustained production of H2O2. The tyrosine kinase pathway was also critical for MMP-2 expression (Fig. 6B) as well as pro-MMP-2 activation. There are several reports on relationships between ROS, protein tyrosine kinase, and NF-κB. It has been suggested that the stimulatory effect of ROS on tyrosine phosphorylation is due to the kinase activation in addition to phosphatase inhibition (27Schieven G.L. Kirihara J.M. Myers D.E. Ledbetter J.A. Uckun F.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 1212-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ROS also increase expression of the growth factors and the phosphorylation of growth factor receptors, types of receptor tyrosine kinases (21Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.R. Kwon J. Sci. STKE. 2000; stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/53/pe1PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as VEGF receptor and PDGF receptor, increases H2O2 via PI3-K has been reported previously (28Colavitti R. Pani G. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Waltenberger J. Galeotti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3101-3108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 29Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar, 30Bae Y.S. Sung J.Y. Kim O.S. Kim Y.J. Hur K.C. Kazlauskas A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10527-10531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be explained that the sustained production of H2O2 by PMS activates PDGF, VEGF, PI3-K, and the NF-κB pathways. In turn PDGF/PI3-K and VEGF/PI3-K pathways increase H2O2, which is a positive feedback loop, consisting of H2O2, PDGF, VEGF, and PI3-K. Pro-MMP-2 activation by ROS may depend on cell types. The sustained production of H2O2 induced pro-MMP-2 activation in HT1080 cells and human endothelial cells, but T98G and NIH3T3 cells did not show any effect with the same treatment (Fig. 9A). This indicates that different cells react differently to the same stimulator. Cells having a large amount of MT1-MMP, even weak stimulations, can lead to pro-MMP-2 activation. If cells have a small amount of MT1-MMP such as NIH3T3 and T98G, even strong stimulators cannot activate pro-MMP-2, even though the level of MMP-2 expression is high, as in T98G (Fig. 9B). This implies a threshold of MT1-MMP level for MMP-2 activation. MT1-MMP is overexpressed in certain types of malignant tumor cells (31Yamamoto M. Mohanam S. Sawaya R. Fuller G.N. Seiki M. Sato H. Gokaslan Z.L. Liotta L.A. Nicolson G.L. Rao J.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 384-392PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these cells can readily achieve the MT1-MMP threshold level and activate pro-MMP-2 and further promote metastasis and angiogenesis. However, many cells do not have large amounts of MT1-MMP; therefore, a transient increase in tyrosine kinases activity does not increase MT1-MMP to the threshold level. Only sustained stimulation of tyrosine kinases increases the potential of threshold level of MT1-MMP. HT1080 cells produce a large amount of MT1-MMP even without stimulator (Fig. 9B). This can be explained by constitutively active Akt, downstream target of PI3-K, in HT1080 (32Yoon S.O. Kim M.M. Park S.J. Kim D. Chung J. Chung A.S. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further studies were performed on the relationship between PI3-K pathway and MT1-MMP expression in various cells. MT1-MMP not only participates in the processing of pro-MMP-2 but also digests various ECM components in vitro, including collagen (33Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), thereby profoundly stimulating tumor cell invasion. These data explain why ROS such as H2O2 accelerate metastasis and angiogenesis. Besides matrix degradation by active MMPs, the cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, and cell motility are closely associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis (1Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar, 34Genda T. Sakamoto M. Ichida T. Asakura H. Hirohashi S. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Kaczarek E. Zapf S. Bouterfa H. Tonn J.C. Westphal M. Giese A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1999; 17: 625-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For cells to invade the matrix, intercellular adhesions are weakened and tumor cells separate from solid tumor tissue. Therefore, weakening of the cell-cell interaction accelerates tumor cell invasion. In addition, cellular survival and invasion are promoted by cell-matrix interaction via integrins. PMS reduced cell-cell interaction (Fig. 10A) and increased cell motility (Fig. 10, C and D) but did not affect cell-collagen interaction (Fig. 10B). It has been shown that superoxide anion treatment enhances cell motility (36Muramatsu H. Kogawa K. Tanaka M. Okumura K. Nishihori Y. Koike K. Kuga T. Niitsu Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6210-6214PubMed Google Scholar), but our studies showed that sustained production of H2O2 by PMS is responsible for the increased motility and invasion, but not superoxide anion, because DDC treatment in the presence of PMS prevented these phenomena (Fig. 10, C–E). This study may explain the destructive role of chronic inflammation on tissue. Inflammatory reactions, particularly chronic ones, can be a significant source of oxidative stress. Leukocytes such as activated macrophages and neutrophils release a number of ROS including H2O2 and superoxide anion that can damage the nearby cells, and furthermore, these ROS have the potential to change normal cells to tumor cells. It has been estimated that approximately one-third of the world's cancers are due to the effects of chronic inflammation (37Klein G. Science. 1987; 238: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In addition, inflammation is found during matrix remodeling in many clinical situations, including wound healing and tumor invasion, thereby increasing tumor cell metastasis, which is still not well understood. Tumor cells produce large amounts of ROS (38Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar), and sublethal amounts of superoxide anion protect cells from apoptosis (14Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). During inflammation, NF-κB, which is known to be involved in cell survival, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, is activated (39Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Poynter M.E. Baeuerle P.A. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). From this combined information, it can be proposed that the sustained production of H2O2 from chronic inflammation increases tumor cell resistance against the defense system of the body and invasion through 1) a decrease in cell-cell attachment, 2) an increase in matrix degradation by increasing the MT1-MMP expression and activation of pro-MMP-2, and 3) an increase in cell motility. In particular, the protein tyrosine kinase/PI3-K/NF-κB pathway may be most important for pro-MMP-2 activation through MT1-MMP induction by chronic inflammation-induced H2O2. Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein can be good candidates for the application of anti-metastatic drugs. We thank Dr. V.

This interaction regulates cell-ECM1 adhesion, migration, cytoskeleton organization, and gene expression through signal transduction pathways (2Zimmermann P. David G.

This interaction may be differently regulated in cancer cells, since they are generally less adhesive and more migratory than normal counterparts. Therefore, it is probable that syndecans may influence adhesion to the ECM, cell morphology, and tumorigenic activity of cancer cells. Indeed, syndecan expression has been shown to suppress transformation and migration of several tumor cells (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev.

Syndecan-1, in particular has been associated with a tumor suppressor function. Transfection of syndecan-1 cDNA dramatically reverses the transformed phenotype of the S115 mammary epithelial-derived tumor cell line and inhibits soft agar colony formation (5Markku M. Helena A. Heini M.M. Markku J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27795-27798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of syndecan-1 is inhibited by malignant transformation of human keratinocytes (6Inki P. Larjava H. Haapasalmi K. Miettinen H.M. Grenman R. Jalkanen M. Eur. J.

Similarly, syndecan-4, which is mainly involved in cytoskeletal and membrane reorganization to form stress fibers and focal adhesions at the later stage of primary fibroblast spreading (13Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), inhibits cell migration and tumor activity (14Longley R.L. Woods A.

RH-77 lymphoma cells, which readily invade type I collagen gels, fail to do as after expression of either syndecan-1 or -4 (16Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D.

However, several reports indicate that syndecan-2 may positively regulate cell migration, since syndecan-2 is normally highly expressed in cells under migratory conditions (22Kusano Y. Oguri K.

In particular, in Lewis lung carcinoma-derived P29 cells, syndecan-2 plays a major role in the interaction with fibronectin and regulates actin stress fiber formation in cooperation with integrin α5β1 (22Kusano Y.

These reports indicate that syndecan-2 may function as a cell surface receptor in highly migratory tumor cells. Here, we present evidence that syndecan-2 plays a critical role in adhesion of colon carcinoma cells onto the ECM, and most importantly, this interaction is crucial for proliferation and tumorigenic activity in colon carcinoma cells.

Isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside, glutathione-Sepharose beads, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. One normal colorectal cell line (CCD-18Co), three colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (SW403, LoVo, COLO205), and three colorectal carcinoma cell lines (HCT116, KM12SM, KM1214) were purchased from the Korean cell line bank. HCT116 were grown in McCoy's 5a, KM1214 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and KM12SM were grown in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (10 μg/ml, Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. For treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF), KM1214 and KM12SM cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free media with or without 2E (0.5 μg/ml), and then 10 nm EGF was added for 5–30 min. Total RNA extracted from cultured cells was used as the template for reverse transcriptase reaction. Aliquots of cDNA were amplified using the following primers: human syndecan-1 (forward) 5′-GCTCTGGGGATGACTCTGAC-3′ and (backward) 5′-GTAT-TCTCCCCCGAGGTTTC-3′; human syndecan-2 (forward) 5′-ACATCTCCCCTTTG-CTAACGGC-3′ and (backward) 5′-TAACTCCATCTCCTTCCCCAGG-3′; human syndecan-4 (forward) 5′-GTCTGGCTCTGGAGATCTGG-3′ and (backward) 5′-TGGGGGCTTTCTTGTAGATG-3′; human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward) 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and (backward) 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′; integrin β1 (forward) 5′-GCGCATATCTGGAAATTTGG-3′ and (backward) 5′-TCTC-CAGCAAACCC-3′. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s (except glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and integrin β1 at 60 °C), and extension at 72 °C for 60 s were carried out. The reaction products were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gels. The amplified DNA fragments (syndecan-1, 552 bp; syndecan-2, 539 bp; syndecan-4, 397 bp; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 600 bp; integrin β1, 143 bp) were cloned and sequenced to confirm the PCR products. After cultures were washed twice with PBS (500 μl/10-cm diameter plate), the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, denatured with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the appropriate antibodies followed by species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; AmershamBiosciences). For syndecan-2 antisense cDNA, a 5′ fragment of 150 bp was excised using the polylinker HindIII site and an internal HindIII site and relegated into pcDNA3.1 cut with HindIII. KM1214 cells (2 × 106) were plated on 6-cm diameter culture dishes, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and then transfected with 4 μg of mock- or antisense syndecan-2 in pcDNA3.1 using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). The extracellular domains of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 were cloned into pGEX-5X-1. These constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α, and expressions of fusion protein and the glutathioneS-transferase ectodomain of syndecan-2 (2E) and -4 (4E) were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside for 7 h. The fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified 2E and 4E were used after dialysis in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. 35-mm bacteria culture plates were coated with either 20 μg/ml syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 antibody in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The coated plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blocked with 0.2% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed again with PBS (3 × 5 min). KM1214 and LoVo cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin-0.53 mm EDTA, suspended in serum-free media containing 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and centrifuged. Cells were resuspended in serum-free media, plated on the coated plates, and incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C. To study the morphological changes, cells were incubated with or without 2E for 24 h in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were photographed at 20× magnification with a digital camera (Olympus). Cell proliferation was measured by a colorimetric assay using MTT. In brief, KM1214 and KM12SM cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA and seeded into 35-mm dishes at 1 × 104 cells/dish. After allowing cells to attach to the plate for 24 h, fresh medium containing 2E or 4E (0.25 μg/ml) was added. After incubation, the medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) was added to each plate in a volume of 100 μl, and cells were incubated for 1 h. The medium was then removed, and 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each plate for half an hour at room temperature. The mean concentration of absorbance at 570 nm in each set of samples was measured using a 96-well microtiter plate reader (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA). Also, the growth activity of syndecan-2 antisense transfected cells was performed as described above. Colon cancer cells were cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes then washed with PBS and released trypsin (w/v), 1 mm EDTA followed by the addition of PBS. After pellets formed, cells were resuspended in PBS and counted. Cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with anti-syndecan-2 or anti-syndecan-4 in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h on 4 °C. Then PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 was added, and the cells were washed three times and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-chicken in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min. Syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. For the cell cycle distribution, KM1214 cells were cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes containing 7 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with or without 0.75 μg/ml 2E or 4E. After 24∼36 h, cells were collected by centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 5 min) and fixed with 70% EtOH at 4 °C overnight. Cells were collected again by centrifugation (4,000 rpm, 10 min) and washed with PBS. Cells were treated with RNase (250 μg/ml in PBS) and then stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml in PBS) at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry, and cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed by MULTICYCLE software. Each well of a 6-well culture plate was coated with 3 ml of bottom agar mixture (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.6% agar). After the bottom layer had solidified, 2 ml of top agar mixture (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.3% agar) containing either 1 × 105 cells with 2E or antisense transfected cells was added to each well, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Every 5 days, normal growth medium was gently layered over the cultures, and either 2E or 4E was added. Colony formation was monitored daily with a light microscope. Colonies in soft agar were photographed with a digital camera after incubation for 14 days. We investigated mRNA expression of each syndecan family member in several colon cancer cell lines including normal (CCD-18co), weakly metastatic (COLO205, SW403, and LOVO), and highly metastatic cells (KM1214, KM12SM, and HCT116, Fig. 1A). mRNA expression of syndecan-1 was decreased in most colon cancer cell lines. On the other hand, syndecan-2 mRNA levels were increased by 2–5-fold in all cancer cell lines tested compared with normal colon cell line. Syndecan-4 expression levels were decreased in highly metastatic cell lines, whereas integrin β1expression levels were not significantly changed. Cell surface expression of syndecan-2 was correspondingly increased in colon carcinoma cell lines, whereas syndecan-4 was not (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that syndecan-2 may be related to tumorigenic activity in colon carcinoma cells. Because it is known that syndecans regulate cell-ECM interactions (1Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 2Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (suppl.): S91-S100PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether increased expression of syndecan-2 regulates the adhesion of colon cancer cells to the ECM. The function of syndecan-2 core proteins as a cell surface receptor was directly analyzed with purified recombinant syndecan-2 (2E), corresponding to the extracellular domain of syndecan-2, and extracellular domain of recombinant syndecan-4 (4E) as a control (Fig.2A). The addition of 2E completely blocked the adhesion of colon cancer cells on the ECM in two different experimental conditions. First, cells were detached and replated onto tissue culture plates in the presence of 0.75 μg/ml either 2E or 4E (Fig. 2B). In the absence of 2E (Control), both KM1214 and KM12SM normally attached and spread onto tissue culture plates at 24 h after plating. In the presence of 2E, however, these cells were did not attach at all, even after 48 h. In contrast, their attachment and spread normally occurred in the presence of the same amount of 4E. Second, either 2E or 4E was added to exponentially growing cells, and the morphological changes were monitored (Fig. 2C). Unexpectedly, at 24 h after the addition of 2E but not 4E, cells started rounding and floating off from the tissue culture plates. We presumed that this was due to interruption of cell interaction with the ECM through syndecan-2. To more directly access the involvement of syndecan-2 in adhesion on the ECM, highly metastatic KM1214 and weakly metastatic LoVo cells were detached and replated onto antibody-coated plates (Fig.3). Compared with cells on either bovine serum albumin- or syndecan-4 antibody-coated plates that remained unattached, both colon carcinoma cells on syndecan-2 antibody-coated plates were normally attached (90 ± 8%, 89 ± 6%) and spread (46 ± 9%, 40 ± 2%) at 12 h after plating. It was even more efficient than normal culture conditions on tissue culture plates. The number of either attached or spread KM1214 cells on syndecan-2 antibody-coated plates was ∼1.5 and 2.2 times higher than cells on normal tissue culture plates (T/C plate), respectively (Fig. 3A). These results strongly suggest that syndecan-2 mediates the adhesion of colon cancer cells to the ECM. Engagement of cells on the ECM is important for cell growth (35Boudreau N. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 36Danen E.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Because syndecan-2 is expressed highly in colon cancer cells, syndecan-2 may play a critical role in the tumorigenic activity in colon cancer cells. We investigated whether syndecan-2 regulated proliferation of cancer cells. Both KM12SM and KM1214 cells were cultured in the presence of low amounts (0.25 μg/ml) of either 2E or 4E, and cell numbers were quantified using a colorimetric assay (Fig.4A). In the presence of 2E, but not 4E, both cell lines showed no net increase in cell number, implying that blocking of syndecan-2 function with 2E caused severe growth arrest. Consistent with these data, transfection of 4 μg of antisense syndecan-2 cDNA reduced cell surface expression of syndecan-2 (Fig. 4B, left panel) and induced cell cycle arrest in KM1214 cells (Fig. 4B, right panel). Both 2E-treated and antisense syndecan-2-transfected cells showed increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p53, p21, and p27 (28Gartel A.L. Goufman E. Najmabadi F. Tyner A.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5182-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and decreased expression of cyclin E and cyclin D2 (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using propidium iodide staining confirmed that 2E induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase (Fig.5C). Exposure of cells for 36 h with 2E caused inhibition of progression from the G0/G1 to S and G2/M phase in KM1214, which resulted in an increase of 1.35× the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase compared with control cells. In contrast to 2E, 4E did not significantly affect cell growth. All these data strongly suggest that syndecan-2 is important for proliferation in colon carcinoma cells.FIG. 5Inhibition of syndecan-2 induces cell cycle arrest. A, after treatment with recombinant syndecan-2E for the indicated period of time, cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting with each antibody. B, KM1214 cells (1 × 106) were transfected using Effectene with the syndecan-2 antisense in pcDNA 3.1. After 3 days of selection in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml of G418, cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting. C, KM1214 cells (2 × 106) were incubated with recombinant syndecan-2E or syndecan-4E, and cell cycle distribution was analyzed by propidium iodide staining. Representative results from three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Several studies show that EGF receptors are expressed at high levels in a variety of epithelial cancers including colon cancer, and activation of EGF receptors appears to be critical for the growth of many tumors (37Radinsky R.

Compared with control cells, 2E-pretreated cells showed decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to 10 nm EGF (Fig.6). Therefore, increased expression of syndecan-2 is closely correlated with increased proliferative activity in colon cancer cells. To investigate the effect of syndecan-2 on tumorigenic activity, we performed anchorage-independent growth assay in soft agar. The colony-forming ability of KM1214 cells was reduced ∼70% in the presence of syndecan-2E (0.75 μg/ml) compared with normal cells (Fig.7A). Similarly, transfection of antisense syndecan-2 cDNA into KM1214 cells significantly reduced colony formation in soft agar in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B). Therefore, expression of syndecan-2 was crucial for anchorage-independent growth in colon cancer cells. Cell adhesion to the ECM is mediated by specific cell surface receptors, and progression of colon and other cancers has been associated with changes in their level of expression and/or activity. Cancer cells change adhesive properties, and this is important for tumorigenesis and metastatic spread. In this study, we have investigated the function of a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan in colon cancer cells. Among syndecans tested, syndecan-2 plays a critical role as a major adhesion receptor in mediating adhesion and regulating proliferation of cancer cells. Similar to previous reports (6Inki P.

Virchows Arch. 1999; 434: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), together with decreased expression of integrin β1, the expression of both syndecan-1 and -4 was decreased in several colon cell lines, suggesting decreased cell adhesion and increased cell migration. In contrast to syndecan-1 and -4, the expression of syndecan-2 was increased in all colon cancer cell lines tested (Fig. 1B). Therefore, it is highly possible that syndecan-2 mediates adhesion to the ECM. In fact, colon carcinoma cell lines KM1214 can spread on syndecan-2 antibody-coated plates more than on normal tissue culture plates, an effect not shared by syndecan-4 antibody-coated plates (Fig. 3, A and B). Blocking the interactions of syndecan-2 using recombinant syndecan-2 ectodomain (2E) resulted in detachment of colon carcinoma cells from the tissue culture plates (Fig. 2, Aand B). Therefore, it seems that syndecan-2 is a major adhesion receptor in colon carcinoma cells. Because the interaction of cells with the ECM regulates cell proliferation, syndecan-2 engagement is important for cell proliferation in colon carcinoma cells since either functional blocking using 2E (Fig. 4A) or antisense cDNA expression induces cell cycle arrest (Fig. 4B). Therefore, it seems that increased expression of syndecan-2 is crucial for increased rates of cell proliferation, an important characteristic of tumor cells. In normal epithelial cells and tissues, the expression level of syndecan-2 is less than that of syndecan-4. This implies that during transformation into cancer cell lines, there is a change of expression patterns from anti-tumorigenic syndecans (syndecan-1 and -4) to tumorigenic syndecan (syndecan-2). This is similar to the mechanism in breast cancer cells (29Hazan R.B. Pillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). E-cadherins are the major cell-cell adhesion receptor in normal epithelial cells (30Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and in a variety of carcinomas, their expressions are decreased (32Pignatelli M. Liu D. Nasin M.N. Stamp V.H. Hirano S. Takeichi M. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, some carcinomas, such as breast cancer, express similar amounts of E-cadherins but increased expression of N-cadherins, which mediate proper adhesion for cancer cell migration (29Hazan R.B. Pillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 31Li G. Satyamoorthy K. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3819-3825PubMed Google Scholar). In order for cells to migrate, they require weaker interactions. For this purpose, increased syndecan-2 expression is meaningful, since syndecan-2 is found in many migratory cells, and even in fibroblasts, syndecan-2 is located in cortical actin, which is involved in rapid turnover of actin filaments (26Granes F. Garcia R. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Castel S. Rocamora N. Reina M. Urena J.M. Vilaro S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show the importance of increased expression of syndecan-2 for tumorigenic activity of colon cancer cells (Fig. 7). What is the role of syndecan-2 in colon cancer cell lines, related to tumorigenic activity? First, as mentioned above, syndecan-2 is crucial in increasing the rates of cell proliferation. Cells treated with 2E or transfected with antisense syndecan-2 induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, suggesting that engagement of syndecan-2 and the ECM transduces signals for tumor cell proliferation. Thus, it will be very interesting to identify the cytosolic protein(s) interacting with syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain in colon cancer cells. Second, syndecan-2 may regulate the activity or localization of matrix metalloproteases, important regulators of cancer cell migration/invasion (33Ellerbroek S.M. Stack M.S. Bioessay. 1999; 21: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Westermarck J. Kahari V. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Because cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan is known to dock matrix metalloprotease into the cell surface (41Kaushal G.P. Xiong X. Athota A.B. Rozypal T.L. Sanderson R.D. Kelly T. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Dhodapkar M.V. Kelly T. Theus A. Athota A.B. Barlogie B. Sanderson R.D. Br. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), we have tested the effect of recombinant syndecan-2 core proteins on matrix metalloprotease activity, but there was no significant difference. 2H. Park, Y. Kim, Y. Lim, I. Han, and E.-S. Oh, unpublished results. Third, syndecan-2 may directly regulate the interaction of colon cancer cells with the ECM during migration. Because cancer cells have more migratory tendencies with different adhesion receptors, syndecan-2 may be crucial for cancer cell invasion and migration. The mechanism of tumorigenic activity of syndecan-2 needs to be further investigated in detail."

Down-regulation of GIF in cortical neurons with antisense S-oligonucleotides promoted neuronal death under high oxygen conditions.

Immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis indicate that GIF is distributed abundantly in astrocytes of the normal human brain but is reduced in astrocytes in the lesioned areas of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Down's syndrome, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (1Uchida Y.

GIF was characterized as an inhibitory substance for survival and neurite formation of cerebral cortical neurons in the presence of neurotrophic factors in AD brains (1Uchida Y. Takio K. Ihara Y. Tomonaga M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). However, the function of GIF, other than the inhibition of neurotrophic factors, remains unknown. In the absence of neurotrophic factors, GIF is not toxic to neurons, but rather maintains the survival of neurons in culture (5Erickson J.C. Sewell A.K. Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. Palmiter R.D. Brain Res. 1994; 649: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, MT-III (GIF)-overexpressing mice have enhanced resistance to neuronal injury induced by kainic acid, whereas MT-III-deficient mice have enhanced sensitivity to kainic acid (6Erickson J.C. Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Erickson J.C. Hollopeter G. Thomas S.A. Froelick G.J. Palmiter R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GIF may play a role in the protection of neurons against toxic substances. Although neurodegenerative diseases and seizures involve different etiological processes, oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis and/or progression or at least as a final common mediator of neuronal death in both of these diseases. This suggests the possibility that GIF may act as a free radical scavenger. To test this possibility, we examined whether GIF prevents neurite extension from undifferentiated neurons and/or the death of differentiated neurons caused by reactive oxygen species in culture, and whether GIF has scavenging activities for superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, NO, or peroxynitrite. 5,5-Dimethylpyrroline 1-oxide (DMPO), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-(N-methyl-3- aminopropyl)-3-methyl-1-triazene (NOC-7), 1,2-dimyristoylamido-1,2-deoxyphosphatidylcholine, 2-(4-trimethylammoniophenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide chloride (TMA-PTIO), and peroxynitrite were purchased from Dojindo Laboratory (Kumamoto, Japan).l-α-Phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk was obtained from Nakalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). C-DCDHF-DA was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).l-Tyrosine, 3-nitro-l-tyrosine, and 3-chrolo-l-tyrosine were obtained from Sigma. Human GIF was isolated from human brain as previously described (1Uchida Y. Takio K. Ihara Y. Tomonaga M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Purified human GIF contained 4 copper and 3 zinc atoms per polypeptide chain. Rat GIF was purified from rat brain according to the procedure reported previously (8Uchida Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1945-1953PubMed Google Scholar). Average metal content in purified rat GIF was 2.22 copper and 0.09 zinc atoms per polypeptide chain (Cu-GIF), because of 0.02 n HCl (pH 2.5) treatment at the first step of purification. After the addition of zinc and copper to Cu-GIF, average metal content of GIF increased to 3.12 copper and 2.13 zinc atoms per polypeptide chain (Cu,Zn-GIF). The concentration of GIF protein in cell lysate or medium was measured by two-site ELISA as previously described (8Uchida Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1945-1953PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit liver metallothionein I+II (Cd,Zn-MT) was obtained from Sigma. GIF and MT-I+II were dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. For neuronal cell culture, cerebral cortices dissected from embryonic day 17 rats were dissociated by incubation with 0.08% trypsin, 0.008% DNase I at 37 °C for 10 min, and passed through a 62-μm nylon mesh. To assess neuronal survival, cerebral cortical cells (1.85 × 104 cells/well) in 96-well microtiter plates coated with gelatin-polyornithine were cultured for 5 days in MEM plus 5% fetal bovine serum containing 10 μmβ-mercaptoethanol under air plus 5% CO2. Then the cells were incubated in MEM-N2-pyruvate medium with or without GIF under 50% O2 + 5% CO2 for an additional 48 h. Neuronal survival was assessed by quantifying anti-MAP2 binding to the cultured cells using ELISA (9Uchida Y. Tomonaga M. Brain Res. 1989; 481: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To assess neurite outgrowth, cerebral cortical cells (3 × 104 cells/well) seeded in multiwell plates (9 × 9 mm) precoated with gelatin-polyornithine, were cultured for 12 h in MEM plus 5% fetal bovine serum with or without GIF under 50% O2 + 5% CO2. Cell were fixed and labeled with β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (AmershamBiosciences) by the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. The neurite length was determined by measuring the distance between the end of the longest neurite and the cell surface. This measurement was done for 150 neurons in 18 or 19 fields in each experiment. Astrocyte cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex of postnatal day 2 rats and subcultured three times as previously described (8Uchida Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1945-1953PubMed Google Scholar). An antisense S-oligodeoxynucleotide (S-ODN) directed against bases 53–76 (initial codon at 62) of rat GIF mRNA (10Kobayashi H. Uchida Y. Ihara Y. Nakajima K. Kosaka S. Miyatake T. Tsuji S. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number not available) (5′-GGTCTCAGGGTCCATATCCAGGCC-3′), a scrambled S-ODN (5′-CCGGCTGGTCTCAGGGTCCATATC-3′), and a sense GIF S-ODN (5′-GGCCTGGATATGGACCCTGAGACC-3′) were synthesized by Nippon Seifun. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antisense S-ODN at the 5′ end was also synthesized to monitor transfection efficiency to cortical neurons. Cultured cells were transfected with S-ODNs (250 nm) using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) twice at 15-h intervals. Thirty hours after the first transfection, cells were re-treated with S-ODNs alone in MEM-N2 pyruvate and maintained for an additional 24 h under 5% CO2 plus air or 50% oxygen. Fifty-four hours after the first transfection, the cells were analyzed for GIF protein level by two-site ELISA (8Uchida Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1945-1953PubMed Google Scholar) and for neuronal death by propidium iodide (PI) assay. Briefly, cells were incubated with PI (20 μm) and Hoechst 33342 (10 μm) solution (in PBS) for 10 min. After fixation, dead cell nuclei were visualized in red fluorescence with PI and nuclei of both live and dead cell were visualized with Hoechst 33342. The transfection efficiencies of antisense ODN as determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence of targeted neurons were almost 100%. The lipophilic fluorogen C-DCDHF-DA is retained in viable cells and converted intracellularly to a fluorescent molecule by oxidization. The fluorescence intensity thus depends on the amount of intracellular peroxide. Cultured neurons were incubated with C-DCDHF-DA at a final concentration of 10 μm for 10 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 plus air. Cells were dissociated by pipetting, and the fluorescence intensity of the cells was analyzed using an EPICS ELITE cell sorter. Superoxide radical was generated from a hypoxanthine xanthine oxidase reaction under the conditions as previously reported (11Mitsuta K. Mizuno Y. Kohno M. Hiramatsu M. Mori A. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1990; 63: 187-191Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the presence of the spin trap, DMPO, the superoxide was produced as the more stable spin adduct, DMPO-O2−. ESR spectra of DMPO-O2− were acquired using a JES-FA200 (JEOL), operating at an incident micropower of 8 milliwatts, a modulation amplitude of 0.1 mT, a time constant of 0.1 s, and sweep rate of 5 mT/min. Cu,Zn-SOD was used as a standard inhibitor of DMPO adduct production because the decrease in DMPO-O2− signal intensity correlated with the SOD concentration (11Mitsuta K. Mizuno Y. Kohno M. Hiramatsu M. Mori A. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1990; 63: 187-191Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical, generated in a Fenton-type reaction between 0.34 mm H2O2 and 0.34 mmFe2+ chelated with 0.34 mm DTPA in 0.1m PBS (pH 7.4), was trapped with 83.6 mm DMPO to produce a stable hydroxyl radical spin adduct (DMPO-OH), which can be monitored by ESR spectroscopy. The signal intensities of DMPO-OH were evaluated by the relative peak height of DMPO-OH to the intensity of the Mn2+ signal. One hundred percent DMPO-OH represented the signal intensity of DMPO-OH obtained in the absence of the proteins. The concentration of GIF required to reduce the signal intensity of DMPO-OH by 50%, ID50, was determined by using 83.6 mm DMPO and five concentrations of GIF (0.38, 0.77, 1.53, 3.06, and 6.12 μm). The bimolecular rate constant for the reactions of the hydroxyl radical with GIF was calculated by using the following expression: kGIF/·OH= kDMPO/·OH× [DMPO]/ID50 of GIF, according to the method of Mitsuta (11Mitsuta K. Mizuno Y. Kohno M. Hiramatsu M. Mori A. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1990; 63: 187-191Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide, generated from NOC-7, was trapped with PTIO in liposomes to produce a stable PTI in liposome vesicles. Liposome PTIO was prepared by a reversed-phase evaporation method as described (12Akaike T. Maeda H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 211-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by using l-α-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk, 1,2-dimyristoylamido-1,2-deoxyphosphatidylcholine, and TMA-PTIO. The concentration of liposome PTIO was determined from the double integration of the ESR signal with TMA-PTIO as a standard. NOC-7 (10 μm) was added to the mixture of GIF solution and liposome PTIO (25 μm) suspension, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. PTI and unreacted PTIO were monitored by ESR spectroscopy, and the relative signal intensities of PTI were calculated according to the previous report (12Akaike T. Maeda H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 211-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite (final concentration 1.22 mm) was added to the mixture ofl-tyrosine (final concentration 1 mm) and proteins (GIF or MT-I+II) in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, 3-chloro-l-tyrosine (final concentration of 0.01 mm) was added to the reaction mixture as an internal standard. The 3-nitro-l-tyrosine produced in the reaction mixture was analyzed by VP-318 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography according to the method of Nakagawa (13Nakagawa H. Sumiki E. Takusagawa M. Ikota N. Matushima Y. Ozawa T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 2000; 48: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To examine whether GIF is secreted from astrocytes, we measured the amount of cellular GIF and extracellular GIF secreted from astrocytes (23 days in vitro (DIV)) into the medium over a 24-h period by using the two-site ELISA of rat GIF. The cellular content of GIF in astrocytes cultured in serum-free medium was 135.72 ± 42.48 (mean ± S.E.) ng/mg of protein (n = 3). The extracellular:intracellular ratio of GIF was 1.29 ± 0.40 (n = 3), whereas the extracellular:intracellular ratio of lactate dehydrogenase was 0.072 ± 0.003 (n = 3), indicating that extracellular GIF does not result from cell lysis in the culture. It is possible that GIF is stored and secreted by a regulated pathway (14Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of GIF on cortical neurons, other than inhibition of neurotrophic factors in AD brains, 0 or 5 DIV neurons were used for the assessment of GIF effects on neurite extension or neuronal survival, respectively. As shown in Fig.1A, the addition of 100 nm GIF shifted the peak of neurite length to a shorter range. The average neurite lengths of control (2.53 ± 0.11 μm) and GIF-treated neurons (1.85 ± 0.09 μm) were significantly different (p < 0.0001). Fig. 1B shows that the addition of GIF at 125–250 nm did not inhibit but rather supported the survival of 5 DIV neurons cultured for an additional 2 days (p < 0.01). GIF at up to 1 μm did not inhibit but rather supported the survival of cortical neurons (data not shown). In contrast to GIF, Zn7-MT-I+II at 125 nm did not support neuronal survival. These results indicate that GIF suppresses the neurite extension from neurons in the early period of differentiation and suppresses cell death of more differentiated neurons. Hyperoxia is stimulus for neuronal cells that may cause either differentiation (15Kato S. Mitusi Y. Kitani K. Suzuki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or cell death (16Enokido Y. Akaneya Y. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1992; 599: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to speculate that the prevention of neuronal differentiation and death by GIF is mediated by a scavenging activity of GIF for reactive oxygen species (ROS). To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether GIF prevents neurite extension and neuronal death under a high oxygen atmosphere. As shown in Fig.2A, exposure of cortical neurons to high oxygen shifted the peak of neurite length to a longer range; however, the addition of 100 nm GIF in the medium shifted the peak of neurite length back to a shorter range than that of the control cultures. The average neurite length of neurons exposed to high oxygen (2.66 ± 0.08 μm) and that of neurons treated with both GIF and high oxygen (1.98 ± 0.09 μm) were significantly different (p < 0.0001). Fig. 2B shows that high oxygen exposure reduced neuronal survival to 37.8 ± 2.4% in the absence of GIF. The addition of GIF (100 nm) but not of Zn7-MT-I+II (100 nm) partially prevented neuronal death by high oxygen (p < 0.01). The effect of GIF up to 300 nm on preventing neuronal death by high oxygen exposure was the same as that of 100 nm GIF (data not shown). These results suggest that GIF prevents neuronal differentiation and neuronal death induced by high oxygen exposure. To confirm the protective action of GIF against neuronal death by high oxygen exposure, we examined whether the down-regulation of GIF in cortical neurons by a GIF antisense ODN results in the promotion of neuronal death. GIF protein level in transfected astrocytes with antisense ODN (250 nm) for 56 h decreased by 4-fold compared with the level in transfected astrocytes with sense or scramble ODNs (Fig.3A). The basal GIF level in cultured neurons was detectable but lower (∼50 ng/mg of protein) than that in astrocytes. The GIF level in transfected neurons with antisense ODN was below the detection limit in the two-site ELISA (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, the down-regulation of GIF in cortical neurons with antisense ODN promoted neuronal death by 2-fold under 50% oxygen atmosphere for 24 h. Transfection with scramble or sense ODNs did not promote neuronal death by high oxygen exposure for 24 h. These results indicate that down-regulation of GIF in cortical neurons promotes neuronal death induced by high oxygen exposure. To examine whether exogenous GIF reduced the ROS production in cultured neurons, C-DCDHF-DA was added to the neurons cultured for 48 h under 50% O2 + 5% CO2. After additional incubation for 10 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 plus air, cells were dissociated by pipetting and the fluorescence intensity of the cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 4shows typical histograms of ROS production in cortical neurons exposed to 50% O2 for 48 h in the absence or presence of 100 nm GIF in the medium. GIF effectively reduced the ROS production in cortical neurons under 50% oxygen atmosphere. We assessed the scavenging activity of GIF for superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and NO by using ESR spin-trapping. The superoxide scavenging activities of human GIF or rabbit liver MT-I+II, evaluated using Cu,Zn-SOD as a standard, were 5.96 or 7.56 units of SOD equivalent/mg of protein, respectively. The activity of Cu,Zn-SOD used here was 3700 units/mg of protein, indicating that the scavenging activities of GIF or MT-I+II are very weak. Fig. 5 (A and B) shows that the signal intensities of DMPO-OH markedly decreased in the presence of GIF, but not of MT-I+II, in a Fenton-type hydroxyl radical generating system. As shown in Fig. 5C, a dose-dependent decrease in the intensity of DMPO-OH was observed in the presence of GIF. To exclude possible effects caused by metal exchange between copper or zinc in GIF and Fe in the Fenton reaction, we used another hydroxyl radical generating system involving the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide. A similar decrease was observed in the DMPO-OH intensity in the presence of GIF (data not shown). In contrast to the effect of GIF, only a 10–20% decrease was observed in the presence of MT-I+II. The bimolecular rate constant for the reaction of hydroxyl radical with GIF, kGIF/·OH, was estimated as 4.9 × 1013m−1 s−1 by using the value kDMPO/·OH= 2.1 × 109m−1s−1 (17Finkelstein E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4994-4999Crossref Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and the ID50 value = 3.7 μm at a DMPO concentration of 83.6 mm. To determine whether the difference in the hydroxyl radical-scavenging effect between GIF and MT-I+II is caused by the difference in metal supplementation, we assessed the scavenging activity of GIF or MT-I+II reconstituted with other metals in the hydroxyl radical generating system that utilizes photolysis. As shown in Table I, depletion of zinc from Cu,Zn-GIF reduced the scavenging activity for the hydroxyl radical, but replacement of cadmium by zinc in MT-I+II did not enhance the scavenging activity for hydroxyl radical. This suggests that the difference of metal in GIF and MT-I+II does not explain the difference in scavenging activity of the two proteins.Table IEffect of metal content of GIF from rat brain or MT-I+II from rabbit liver on DMPO-OH formation by photolysis of hydrogen peroxideProteinsFormation of DMPO-OH%No protein100Cu,Zn-GIF (2.5 μm)58.5Cu-GIF (2.5 μm)89.9Cd,Zn-MT-I+II (2 μm)82.5Zn-MT-I+II2 μm83.94 μm78.08 μm78.816 μm71.8 Open table in a new tab We examined the NO scavenging activity of GIF. Encapsulated PTIO in liposome reacts with NO and yields PTI stoichiometrically, of which the signals are distinguished by ESR. In this system, only untrapped NO, but not superoxide or various reducing agents outside of liposome, enters the liposomes and reacts with PTIO (Fig.6A). Fig. 6B shows the ESR spectra of liposome PTIO before the addition of NOC-7, the NO-generating agent. The signal intensity of liposome PTIO decreased 15 min after the addition of NOC-7, with alternative increase in the signal intensity of liposome PTI. Fig. 6B also shows the ESR spectra of liposome PTI and residual liposome PTIO 15 min after the addition of NOC-7 to the mixture of liposome PTIO and GIF or MT-I+II. Neither GIF (0.95–7.60 μm) nor MT-I+II (0.84–6.74 μm) altered the signal intensity of liposome PTI (Fig.6B and Table II), indicating that neither GIF nor MT-I+II trap NO generated from NOC-7.Table IIEffects of GIF from rat brain or MT-I+II from rabbit liver on liposome PTI formation by the addition of NOC-7 to liposome PTIOProteinsFormation of PTI%No protein100GIF0.84 μm96.51.68 μm98.33.37 μm103.26.74 μm101.8MT-I+II0.95 μm94.51.90 μm106.13.80 μm101.07.60 μm101.8 Open table in a new tab We then determined whether GIF prevents the formation of 3-nitro-l-tyrosine by peroxynitrite. The tested compounds were human GIF, rat Cu-GIF, rat Cu,Zn-GIF, rabbit Cd,Zn-MT-I+II, rabbit Zn-MT-I+II, and glutathione. None of the tested compounds contained aromatic amino acids. As shown in Fig. 7, rat Cu-GIF (at 20–80 μm), rat Cu,Zn-GIF, and human GIF effectively inhibited the formation of 3-nitro-l-tyrosine by peroxynitrite. Cd,Zn-MT-I+II, Zn-MT-I+II, and glutathione at concentrations of 20–80 μm had weaker inhibitory activity on 3-nitro-l-tyrosine formation. These results indicate that GIF, like MT-I+II and glutathione, is an inhibitor of the tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite, and the inhibitory effect of GIF on the tyrosine nitration does not depend on the metal content. GIF is distributed throughout the soma and fine processes in astrocytes, but is restricted to axons and dendrites in a subset of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Despite the lack of a signal sequence in the GIF peptide, an extracellular:intracellular ratio of 1.29 for astrocytic GIF indicates that GIF is secreted from astrocytes by a regulated pathway (14Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Exogenous GIF in the absence of brain extract from AD patients inhibited neurite extension from cortical neurons but did not inhibit neuronal survival in culture (Fig.1). Instead, GIF maintained survival of neurons, as previously reported (5Erickson J.C. Sewell A.K. Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. Palmiter R.D. Brain Res. 1994; 649: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Amoureux M.C. Wurch T. Pauwels P.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 201: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Because hyperoxia induces both neurite extension and neuronal death, it is reasonable to speculate that GIF protects cortical neurons from hyperoxia. Indeed, GIF prevented the induction of neuronal differentiation and neuronal death by high oxygen exposure (Fig. 2). Reduction of endogenous GIF in cortical neurons with an antisense ODN promoted neuronal death by high oxygen exposure (Fig. 3). Moreover, GIF effectively reduced ROS production, as detected using an indicator of intracellular ROS, in neurons induced by high oxygen exposure (Fig. 4), indicating that GIF protects cortical neurons from oxidative stress via scavenging not only extracellular but also intracellular ROS. To determine which free radicals are targets of GIF, we used ROS and reactive nitrogen species generating systems coupled with ESR to evaluate the scavenging of superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and NO by purified GIF. GIF scavenged neither superoxide generated in the hypoxanthine xanthine oxidase reaction nor NO generated from NOC-7, but did scavenge hydroxyl radicals generated in a Fenton-type reaction or by photolysis of hydrogen peroxide. Although the mechanism by which GIF but not MT-I+II acts as a scavenger for hydroxyl radicals is unclear, the scavenging activity was not the result of the metal-thiolate bonds of Cys-rich GIF, because MT-I+II, which has similar metal-thiolate coordination, did not show the scavenging effect for the hydroxyl radicals. It is not likely that the scavenging activity depends on the presence of copper in proteins (19Tamai K.T. Gralla E.B. Ellerby L.M. Valentine J.S. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8013-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of GIF was zinc-dependent but not copper-dependent (Table I). Even the replacement of cadmium in MT-I+II by zinc did not result in acquisition of scavenging activity for the hydroxyl radicals (Table I). In addition to the scavenging activity for hydroxyl radicals, GIF prevented nitration of tyrosine by peroxynitrite (Fig. 7). However, the scavenging effect for peroxynitrite may not be specific to GIF, because thiol groups of Cys in GIF, MT-I+II, and glutathione may responsible for the peroxynitrite scavenging. Thus, extracellular GIF from astrocytes and/or intraneuronal GIF acts as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, and this may be responsible for the protective action of GIF against neurotoxicity and neurite sprouting induced by high oxygen exposure. The interaction of MT-I or II with ROS or reactive nitrogen species has been reported previously; however, less attention has been paid to GIF (MT-III). Moreover, the ability of MT-I+II to protect against oxidative stress remains controversial. ESR spin-trapping studies indicate that MT-I+II have scavenging ability for superoxide (20Thornally P.J. Vasak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 21Hussain S. Slikker Jr., W. Ali S. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, in comparison with SOD, 300–30,000-fold higher concentrations of MT-I+II are needed for scavenging superoxide (21Hussain S. Slikker Jr., W. Ali S. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). There is also controversy about the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of MT-I and MT-II in spin-trapping studies. The scavenging activity of MT-I+II at high concentration (ID50 = 0.6 mm) for the hydroxyl radical was first reported by Thornalley and Vasak (20Thornally P.J. Vasak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), and then further studied by Kumari et al. (22Kumari M.V.R. Hiramatsu M. Ebadi M. Free Radical Res. 1998; 29: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, Sakurai et al. (23Sakurai H. Satoh H. Hatanaka A. Sawada T. Kawano K. Hagino T. Nakajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Suzukiet al. (24Suzuki K.T. Rui M. Ueda J. Ozawa T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 231-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and O'Brien and Salacinski (25O'Brien P. Salacinski H.J. Arch. Toxicol. 1998; 72: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MT-I+II, especially Cu-MT, generated hydroxyl radicals in the presence of H2O2. Our studies indicated that MT-I+II at lower concentrations (1.67–6.68 μm) do not show scavenging activity for hydroxyl radicals. Specific scavengers for hydroxyl radicals are necessary for assessment of the scavenging activity of MT-I+II. In contrast to MT-I+II, GIF at a concentration of 6.8 μm competed for hydroxyl radicals with more than a 104-fold molar excess of DMPO, and the apparent bimolecular rate constant of k·OH/GIF≈ 5 × 1013m−1s−1 was extremely high, indicating that GIF has scavenging activity for hydroxyl radicals under conditions in which MT-I+II shows no scavenging activity for hydroxyl radicals. It is controversial whether GIF is a scavenger for NO. Montoliu et al. (26Montoliu C. Monfort P. Carrasco J. Palacios O. Capdevila M. Hidalgo J. Felipo V. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated NO quenching ability of GIF (MT-III) based on the loss of Cd(II) ions from GIF induced by the addition of an NO donor. Because they did not add EDTA to sample solutions to control the concentration of transition metals such as iron, sequestration of iron by GIF may occur under the condition of high concentrations of NO (27Kennedy M.C. Gan T. Antholine W.E. Petering D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is likely that release of Cd(II) ions from GIF induced by the addition of NO may be caused by metal exchange from cadmium to iron in the GIF protein. Moreover, those authors did not compare the NO scavenging activity of GIF with that of a standard NO scavenger. We used liposome PTIO (a spin-trapping agent for NO) coupled with ESR to evaluate the scavenging ability of GIF outside the liposomes. In this system, only untrapped NO, but not various proteins that reduce PTIO nonspecifically, enters liposomes, reacts with PTIO, and yields the mixture of PTI and unreacted PTIO, of which the signals are distinguished by ESR. The lack of alteration of the signal intensity of PTI inside liposomes by the addition of GIF or MT-I+II outside the liposomes (Fig. 6 and Table II) indicates that GIF does not compete for NO with PTIO, a NO scavenger. Although the scavenging activity for hydroxyl radicals is observed specifically in GIF, other molecules containing thiol groups or aromatic amino acids also act as inhibitors of tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite. Therefore, the protective effect of GIF on cultured cortical neurons against high oxygen exposure may be explained by the scavenging ability of GIF for hydroxyl radical rather than peroxynitrite. The concentration of GIF required for significant protection against high oxygen toxicity (50–100 nm) is slightly higher than that required for inhibition of neurotrophic factors in AD brain extract (EC50 ≈ 14–27 nm). However, the concentration of GIF required for neuroprotection is in the physiological range, because the average concentrations of GIF in adult rat brain or normal aged human brain determined by the two-site ELISA were 4–8 μg/g of brain (0.5–1 μm). The results reported here indicate that GIF may play a role in reducing ROS via scavenging hydroxyl radicals in brain under physiological conditions.

In man, the bile salt pool circulates 6–10 times/24 h, resulting in a daily hepatic bile salt excretion of 20–40 g. Only about 0.5 g of bile salts escape intestinal absorption and are lost through fecal excretion. This loss is compensated for by de novo hepatic synthesis. The intrinsic link between intestinal bile salt absorption and hepatic synthesis has become apparent from studies showing that hydrophobic bile salts can transcriptionally induce the ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP)1 and repress hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) through the action of the nuclear bile salt receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) (1Grober J.

The chief intestinal bile salt uptake system is the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT/SLC10A2), also called the ileal bile acid transporter. The human ASBT protein consists of 348 amino acids and is encoded by a major 4.0-kb transcript that has been detected in the ileum, cecum, and kidney by Northern blot analyses (3Craddock A.L.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ASBT gene is localized on chromosome 13q33 (7Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that ASBT gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. First, mice with null mutations in the gene coding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) (encoded by Tcf1) have no expression of ASBT in intestine and kidneys, indicating that ASBT gene expression is dependent upon HNF1α (8Shih D.Q. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Shefer S. Bollileni J.S. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J.L. Stoffel M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Second, the rat ASBT gene promoter contains an AP-1 element that binds c-Jun and c-Fos and coexpression of c-Jun enhances promoter activity (9Chen F., Ma, L., Al Ansari N. Shneider B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38703-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Third, intestinal inflammation in rabbits decreases ileal ASBT mRNA levels, whereas glucocorticoid administration in rats leads to up-regulation (10Sundaram U. Wisel S. Stengelin S. Kramer W. Rajendran V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1259-G1265PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nowicki M.J. Shneider B.L. Paul J.M. Heubi J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G197-G1203PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not bile salts regulate the ASBT gene remains controversial; a direct involvement of FXR seems unlikely because FXR−/− mice have no obvious alteration in ASBT expression level (12Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Intestinal bile salt absorption rates have been shown to correlate inversely with serum triglyceride levels, suggesting a connection between ASBT function and lipid metabolism (13Angelin B. Hershon K.S. Brunzell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Duane W.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 96-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacologic inhibition of ASBT function and expression could, therefore, have a major impact not only on the amount of potentially carcinogenic bile salts that enter the colon but also on hepatic VLDL synthesis (15Love M.W.

The primary aim of this study was to characterize the humanASBT gene promoter and to investigate whether a regulatory pathway exists that could account for the observed correlation between ileal bile salt absorption and hepatic lipid and bile salt metabolism. Specifically, we studied whether the human ASBT gene is regulated by a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Prototypic “lipid sensors” within the nuclear receptor superfamily include FXR, which regulates CYP7A1 and bile salt transporter genes (1Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A.

The results indicate an important new mechanism ofASBT gene regulation and identify the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) as a novel link between ileal bile salt absorption and hepatic lipid metabolism. [γ-32P]Adenosine triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, PfuTurbo DNA polymerase from Invitrogen, and T4 polynucleotide kinase from Stratagene. Polyacrylamide was obtained from BioRad. Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Three fragments of the 5′-region of the human ASBT gene were PCR-amplified using human genomic DNA as a template, upstream primers ASBT/−1688for or ASBT/+26for, downstream primers ASBT/+21rev or ASBT/+526rev (Table I), and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The upstream primers contained an internal SacI restriction site and the downstream primer an internal XhoI site. The resulting PCR products were digested with SacI and ligated into the luciferase reporter gene vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega Catalys AG, Wallisellen, Switzerland), which had been predigested with SacI and SmaI, yielding the following promoter constructs: −1688-Luc, −1688/UTR-Luc, UTR-Luc. The −1492/UTR-Luc construct was generated by excising aStuI/SacI fragment from −1688/UTR-Luc. Additional deletional constructs of the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the ASBT gene were constructed by PCR amplification of the 5′-UTR using upstream primers ASBT/+324for or ASBT/+292for and downstream primer ASBT/+539rev (Table I). The upstream primers contained an internal SacI restriction site and the downstream primer a BglII site. The resulting PCR products were digested with SacI and BglII and were ligated into the pGL3-Basic vector predigested with SacI and BglII, resulting in the constructs UTR292–539-Luc and UTR324–539-Luc. UTR26–251-Luc was generated by excising aXhoI fragment from UTR-Luc. The DR1-TK-Luc and mutDR1-TK-Luc plasmids were constructed by ligating a dimerized oligonucleotide (DR1 and mutDR1, respectively, in Table I) containing the DR1 element of theASBT gene and 5′- HindIII and 3′-BamHI overhangs into TK-Luc plasmid predigested with HindIII and BamHI. Sequence identity of all constructs with theASBT gene was verified by sequence analysis.

The product was digested with DpnI to remove the parental DNA template and select for DNA containing the mutation. The mutated plasmid was termed mutDR1–1688/UTR-Luc. Caco2 and HEK293 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). SK-ChA cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. Strazzabosco (Division of Gastroenterology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy). SK-ChA cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Invitrogen), Caco2 and HEK293 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (20% in the case of Caco2 cells), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transactivation assays, Caco2 cells were grown for 3 days in medium containing 20% charcoal-stripped bovine calf serum and then seeded at 90–95% density in 48-well plates. Caco2 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and SK-ChA and HEK293 cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plasmid DNA for reporter assays comprised 350 ng of luciferase promoter construct, 50 ng of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid, and 50 ng each of pCMX-hRXRα (kindly provided by Dr. D. J. Mangelsdorf, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and pSG5-hPPARα (kindly provided by Dr. B. Staels, Département d'Athérosclerose, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Lille, France) expression plasmid or 100 ng of HNF1α/HNF1β expression plasmids (pRSVhumHNF1-correct and pRSV-vHNF1Ahuman, kindly provided by Dr. M. Yaniv, Unité des Virus Oncogènes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). To ensure that the total DNA amount transfected remained constant, pBluescript vector (pB-SKII, CLONTECH, Basel, Switzerland) was used as carrier DNA as required. 18 h after transfection, cells were treated with 1 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) and either 10 μm WY14643 (Calbiochem) or 30 μm ciprofibrate (Sigma) as indicated for 24 h. Controls were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) alone. LMH cells were obtained from ATCC and were grown in William's medium E (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mmglutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin on gelatin-coated dishes (Sigma). 48 h before transfection, cells were seeded on to gelatin-coated 24-well plates in medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped bovine calf serum (Sigma) at 75–80% density. Transfections were performed with 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 500 ng plasmid DNA, the latter comprising 450 ng of luciferase construct and 50 ng of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega Catalys AG). Six hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 30 μm ciprofibrate (Sigma), 50 μm CDCA (Sigma), 10 μm22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-HC, Sigma), or Me2SO for 24 h. Cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega Catalys AG) 24 h after transfection (in the absence of ligand) or after treatment with ligand. Luciferase activity was quantified using the luciferase assay system (Promega Catalys AG) in a Lumat LB 9507–2 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). β-Galactosidase activity was quantified with a high sensitivity assay (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) in a UVmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 595 nm. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were obtained by hybridizing single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). Dimers with the DR1 sequence corresponding to the sequence found in theASBT gene promoter (Table I) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). In vitro translation was performed with the TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega Catalys AG). For gel mobility shift assays, 5 μl of in vitro translated PPARα or 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXRα) protein were incubated on ice for 20 min with 2–5 fmol of [γ32P]-end-labeled dimerized oligonucleotide and 1 μg of poly(dI)poly(dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For competition assays a 500-fold excess of unlabeled dimerized oligonucleotides was added. Sequence mutDR1 (Table I) corresponded to the wild-type ASBT sequence mutated within the DR1 site. For supershift experiments 2 μl of antibody against PPARα (N-19, sc-1985X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) or RXRα (D-20, sc-553X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mix. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through 3.4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE buffer (Tris borate/EDTA) at 120 V for 2 h. 1 μg of total RNA isolated from SK-ChA cholangiocytes was reversed-transcribed (Reverse Transcription System, Promega Catalys AG). Real-time PCR was performed with the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system using one-sixth of the reverse transcription reaction and was analyzed with Applied Biosystems 1.7 software (Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Amplification of the endogenous control was performed with the ribosomal 18 STaqMan PCR master system (Applied Biosystems). ASBT was amplified with the primers ASBTquant-for and ASBTquant-rev (Table I) using cyber green incorporation (SYBR Green PCR-Master Mix, Qiagen). Because validation experiments showed that the amplification efficiencies of the target and the reference were approximately equal, quantitation was performed using the comparative ΔΔCT method. Reporter gene activities are expressed as the mean ± 1 standard error of the mean (S.E.) of 6–10 individual transfection experiments. All data were reproduced at least once using two different preparations of plasmid DNA. As shown in previous studies on the structure of the human ASBT gene (3Craddock A.L. Love M.W. Daniel R.W.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the major transcription initiation site (designated +1 in Fig. 1) is separated by a 598-bp untranslated region from the translation start site on exon 1. Because previous studies had indicated the presence of regulatory elements within the 5′-UTR of the ASBT gene (8Shih D.Q. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Shefer S.

Additional constructs contained only the 5′-UTR (UTR-Luc) or only 5′-flanking sequence (−1688-Luc). These constructs were used to characterize the basal promoter function of the human ASBT gene. For reporter gene assays, cell lines derived from human intestine (Caco2), embryonic kidney (HEK293), and bile duct epithelium (SK-ChA), tissues that have been shown to express the ASBT mRNA (3Craddock A.L.

Transfection of cells with plasmids UTR-Luc, −1492/UTR-Luc, and −1688/UTR-Luc produced significant luciferase activity compared with the promoterless pGL3-Basic vector. The degree of activation was 8–12-fold in Caco2 cells, 2–3-fold in HEK293 cells, and up to 1.7-fold in SK-ChA cells (Fig. 1). Thus ASBT promoter activity was strongest in Caco2 cells, in accordance with real-time PCR experiments that showed the highest endogenous ASBT mRNA levels in Caco2 cells (data not shown). The −1688-Luc construct, that contained only the 5′-flanking sequence without the 5′-UTR, produced no luciferase activity, indicating that factors that bind within the 5′-UTR are essential for minimal promoter function. The importance of HNF1α for expression of theASBT gene became evident in Tcf1−/−(HNF1α−/−) mice with a null mutation in theHNF1α gene (8Shih D.Q. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Shefer S. Bollileni J.S. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J.L. Stoffel M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These mice show no expression of the ASBT (Slc10a2) mRNA in the terminal ileum and kidney and a 6-fold elevation of fecal bile salt concentrations. A single HNF1α binding site, corresponding to nt +253 to +267 in the 5′-UTR of the human ASBT gene (Fig. 2, Table II) was described by Shih et al. (8Shih D.Q. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Shefer S. Bollileni J.S. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J.L. Stoffel M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This site conferred inducibility by coexpressed HNF1α in HIT-T15 cells and bound HNF1α in gel shift mobility assays. Although mutagenesis of the site decreased transactivation by HNF1α, the mutated construct was still activated ∼12-fold by coexpressed HNF1α (8Shih D.Q. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M.

This suggested additional HNF1α binding sites in the human ASBT gene.Table IIHNF1 binding sites located in the 5′-UTR of the human ASBT mRNALocation on ASBT mRNAOrientationHNF1 binding sitent 139–125ComplementaryTGTTAATGtTTcAtGnt 267–253ComplementaryCGTTAATGtTTAAtGnt 318–304ComplementaryGaTTAATCATTtAtTConsensus HNF1 sequenceGTTAATNATTAAC Open table in a new tab Sequence analysis of the human ASBT promoter from nt −1688 to +598 using the program Mat Inspector (Genomatix Software, Munich, Germany) identified two additional HNF1 binding sites at nt +125 to +139 and +304 to +318, both also localized in the 5′-UTR (Fig. 2, Table II). The site at nt +125 to +139 is human-specific compared with the rodentASBT gene sequences (9Chen F., Ma, L., Al Ansari N. Shneider B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38703-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To assess the role of each of the three HNF1 binding sites in activating the ASBT gene, deletional reporter constructs were characterized in cotransfection assays with an HNF1α expression plasmid. The UTR-Luc construct, which contained all three HNF1 binding sites, was induced 13-fold by cotransfection of an HNF1α expression vector compared with carrier DNA in Caco2 cells (Fig. 2). Cotransfection of HNF1β, which binds to the identical sequence as HNF1α and is expressed in the kidney, liver, pancreas, and intestine (20Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), had no effect on ASBT promoter activity. A 5′-UTR construct containing only the site at nt 304–318 still conferred a 4.4-fold induction by HNF1α (UTR292–539-Luc in Fig. 2), indicating that this HNF1α element is also functional. A minimal construct containing only nt 324–539 of the 5′-UTR but lacking an HNF1 binding site exhibited residual luciferase activity (∼1.8-fold induction compared with the promoterless pGL3-Basic vector) but was not inducible by HNF1α (UTR324–539-Luc in Fig. 2). Finally, a construct extending from nt 26–251, which contained only the human-specific site at nt 125–139, exhibited no basal luciferase activity compared with the pGL3-Basic vector but was induced 3.8-fold by coexpression of HNF1α (UTR26–251-Luc in Fig. 2). The data thus indicate that all three HNF1α sites in the 5′-UTR of the human ASBT gene are functional response elements that act synergistically to induce gene transcription. This may explain why the complete 5′-UTR is required for full ASBT promoter activity. Because the main objective of this study was to investigate whether a transcriptional mechanism exists that coordinately regulates ASBT and genes involved in hepatic bile salt and lipid metabolism, the ASBT promoter sequence was analyzed for potential binding sites of nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors have also been termed lipid sensors; important candidates known to regulate other bile salt and lipid transporters include FXR, LXRα, and PPARα (21Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). To study whether the ASBT gene promoter is regulated by one of these nuclear receptors, we initially transfected LMH chicken hepatoma cells with the −1688/UTR-Luc and UTR-Luc constructs and with the control vector pGL3-Basic. LMH cells have been used extensively as a model for ligand-dependent activation of endogenously expressed nuclear receptors (22Handschin C. Podvinec M. Stöckli J. Hoffmann K. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1571-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ASBT promoter activity in LMH cells was assayed in the presence or absence of the PPARα ligand ciprofibrate, the LXR ligand, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and the FXR ligand, chenodeoxycholic acid. A 1.75-fold activation of the ASBT promoter construct was observed in the presence of ciprofibrate (Fig.3A), suggesting a possible involvement of PPARα. The UTR-Luc construct, lacking the 5′-flanking region of the ASBT gene, was not inducible by ciprofibrate, indicating that the response element is located in the untranscribed 5′-flanking region of the ASBT gene. Nuclear receptor DNA recognition sites contain consensus hexameric repeat motifs (AGAACA or AGGTCA) that can be organized as direct (DR), everted (ER), or inverted (IR) repeats and are spaced by a defined number of nucleotides (24Waxman D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 25Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Using a weighted matrix-based computational approach (26Podvinec M. Kaufmann M.R. Handschin C. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), no obvious binding sites for FXR or LXRα could be identified. However, a highly conserved binding site arranged as a direct hexanucleotide repeat separated by a single base (DR1 motif, AGGCCAgAGGTCA) was found at position −1565 to −1577 of the human ASBT promoter sequence (Fig. 3). No comparable binding site was detected in the rat ASBT promoter (9Chen F., Ma, L., Al Ansari N. Shneider B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38703-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The DR1 motif has been shown to bind the PPARα/RXRα heterodimer (27Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J.

We cloned IKAP as a JNK-associating protein using the Ras recruitment yeast two-hybrid system. IKAP efficiently and specifically enhanced JNK activation induced by ectopic expression of MEKK1 and ASK1, upstream activators of JNK. Importantly, IKAP also enhanced JNK activation induced by ultraviolet light irradiation as well as treatments with tumor necrosis factor or epidermal growth factor. The JNK association site in IKAP was mapped to the C-terminal part of IKAP. Interestingly, this region is deleted from IKAP expressed in the autonomous nervous system of the patients affected by familial dysautonomia. Ectopic expression of this C-terminal fragment of IKAP was sufficient to support JNK activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel role for IKAP in the regulation of the JNK-mediated stress signaling. Additionally, our results point to a role of JNK signaling in familial dysautonomia and, thus, further support the involvement of JNK signaling in the development, survival, and degeneration of the sensory and autonomic nervous system.

IκB kinase complex-associated protein IκB kinase NCK-interacting kinase JNK-interacting protein familial dysautonomia c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase MAPK kinase kinase kinase MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) kinase apoptosis signaling kinase JNK/SAPK-associated protein stress-activated protein kinase Ras recruitment system tumor necrosis factor hemagglutinin glutathioneS-transferase mixed lineage kinase dual leucine zipper kinase tumor growth factor β-activated kinase IKAP1 was originally purified as a 150-kDa-protein component of the large interleukin 1-inducible IKK complex containing NIK, IKKα, IKKβ, and NF-κB/relA and suggested to be a scaffold protein involved in the assembly of the IKK signalosome (1Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A later report by Krappmannet al. (2Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S., Li, J. Klippel A. Giese K. Baeuerle P.A. Scheidereit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) cast doubt on the role of IKAP in the NF-κB pathway. Using a gel filtration approach, these authors were unable to detect IKAP in the fractions containing IKK complexes. Instead, it was suggested that IKAP is involved in general RNA polymerase II transcription elongation, since the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Elp1/IKI3, which shares 29% identity with IKAP, co-purifies with a protein complex, termed elongator, containing histone acetylase activity and presumably involved in transcriptional elongation (3Otero G. Fellows J., Li, Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Recently, the orthologous human elongator has been purified as well, and indeed, it contains IKAP (4Hawkes N.A. Otero G. Winkler G.S. Marshall N. Dahmus M.E. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Thomas C.L.

IKAP itself does not possess any histone acetylase activity. Thus, its role in transcriptional elongation may be to support the elongator complex assembly (3Otero G. Fellows J., Li, Y. de Bizemont T.

Mutations in the IKBKAP gene encoding IKAP have been shown to be responsible for the autosomal recessive disease familial dysautonomia (5Anderson S.L. Coli R. Daly I.W. Kichula E.A. Rork M.J.

Genet. 2001; 68: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The predominant mutation confers tissue-specific expression of a short version of IKAP truncated at amino acid 714, and homozygousity for the mutation confers poor development, progressive degeneration of the sensory and autonomic nervous system, and early death. Additionally, specific point mutations in the coding region of the IKBKAP gene are reported to increase the risk of bronchial asthma in children (7Takeoka S. Unoki M. Onouchi Y. Doi S. Fujiwara H. Miyatake A. Fujita K. Inoue I. Nakamura Y. Tamari M. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 46: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). How IKBKAP mutations cause or predispose to these diseases are yet unknown. Activation of JNK has been shown to be involved in development, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis, and JNK is the key protein in addition to the related p38 kinase responsible for the rapid transmission of the extracellular stress signals in mammalian cells (8Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar,9Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The JNK family consists of three different isoforms, JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, encoded by three closely related genes that can give rise to 55- and 45-kDa protein products (10Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 11Mohit A.A. Martin J.H. Miller C.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 67-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the expression of JNK3 is restricted to brain and testis (11Mohit A.A. Martin J.H. Miller C.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 67-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recent studies on mice harboring inactivated JNK1, -2, or -3 genes have demonstrated their importance in T-cell differentiation and/or proliferation as well as in the development of the nervous system (for review, see Davis (12Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar)). Inactivation of the JNK3 gene in mice leads to deficiency in the kainic acid-induced excitoxicity, resulting in decreased apoptosis in the hippocampus of the JNK3 knockout mice (13Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). This is probably due to impaired c-Jun phosphorylation since the Jun-ala/ala knock-in mice, in which the major JNK phosphorylation sites (serines 63 and 73) are replaced with alanine residues, also exhibit impaired response to kainic acid (14Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). JNK1 and -2 double knockout mice die around embryonic day 10, apparently due to a defect in neural tube closure that involves decreased apoptosis in the embryonic hindbrain. Interestingly, in the embryonic forebrain lack of both JNK1 and JNK2 causes the opposite phenotype because they are necessary for the survival of the developing cortical neurons (15Kuan C.Y.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), also known as the stress activatedprotein kinases (21Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), a vast number of studies have been carried out to elucidate how extracellular signals are mediated to this kinase family. This work has revealed the existence of a complex network of kinases and other regulatory proteins responsible for JNK activation. It is now well established that JNK, which belongs to the group of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling enzymes, is activated within specific kinase cascades, so called MAPK modules (22Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 23Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The MAPK module is composed of three kinases, a MAPK kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPK. These enzymes sequentially phosphorylate and activate each other. The MAPKKKs respond to regulatory signals from various upstream kinases and cell surface receptors. The known MAPKKKs of the JNK family include the MEKK subfamily (MEKK1–4; Refs. 24Blank J.L.

Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) as well as TAK, DLK, ASK1, MLK, and NCK-interacting kinases (for review, see Ref. 27Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The known MAPKKs for the JNK family pathway are JNKK1, also known as SEK1 or MKK4, and JNKK2, also known as MKK7 (28Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T., Wu, I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 29Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). How the various MAPK modules receive and transmit extracellular signals is yet not fully understood. The proteins that directly interact with JNK can be divided into two groups, those that regulate JNK activity (upstream kinases, inhibitors, and scaffold proteins) and those whose activity is regulated by JNK (substrates). Thus, identification of novel JNK-associating proteins could bring valuable information of the role and function of JNK in various cellular processes. One of the earliest reports of JNK describes it as a kinase that associates with c-Jun and phosphorylates it (18Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). The association of JNK with c-Jun precedes the phosphorylation reaction and is clearly important for its specificity (32Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). c-Jun phosphorylation in turn leads to increased transcriptional activity of AP1 (33Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). JNK associates with most of its other known substrates, like ATF-2, Elk-1, p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and pRb (34Buschmann T. Adler V. Matusevich E. Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 896-900PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Treon S. Teoh G. Raje N. Yoshihimito S. Tai Y.T., Li, W. Fan J. DeCaprio J. Anderson K.C.

Another group of JNK-associating proteins consists of catalytic activators (upstream kinases), non-catalytic activators (scaffold proteins), or inhibitor proteins. JNK-interacting protein, JIP, has been identified as a protein that associates with JNK using the yeast two-hybrid method (34Buschmann T. Adler V. Matusevich E. Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 896-900PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Treon S. Teoh G. Raje N. Yoshihimito S. Tai Y.T., Li, W. Fan J. DeCaprio J. Anderson K.C.

Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Later, JIP-1 has also been shown to bind JNKK2 and MLK and has been suggested to function as a scaffold for JNK activation (39Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Additionally, two other JNK scaffold proteins have been identified, JSAP-1 and β-arrestin 2 (40Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 41McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Arrestin 2 interacts specifically with JNK3 and ASK1. JSAP-1, which appears to be a splicing variant of another JIP family member JIP-3, can bind JNK and is suggested to assemble the MEKK1/JNKK1/JNK3 MAPK module (40Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The members of MEKK family can also actually associate directly with JNK and JNKK (42Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 43Xia Y., Wu, Z., Su, B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 44Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and thus, it has been suggested that the JNK-MAPK module involving MEKKs may function without a scaffold protein (43Xia Y., Wu, Z., Su, B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Common for these three reported JNK scaffold proteins is that they enhance JNK activation when overexpressed together with their specific partner molecules. Ectopic expression of β-arrestin 2 has been shown to induce the activity of the cytosolic JNK3 upon co-expression with ASK1, suggesting that the actual function of β-arrestin 2 could be to retain JNK3 in the cytosol and, thus, inhibit its nuclear entry (41McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar function has been suggested for JIP-1, which was originally cloned as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of JNK due to its ability to associate with JNK and retain it in the cytosol (38Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Additionally, proteins such as p21WAF1, pRb, and Hsp72, have been reported to bind JNK directly and inhibit its activity (45Park H.S. Lee J.S. Huh S.H. Seo J.S. Choi E.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 46Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 47Shim J. Park H.S. Kim M.J. Park J. Park E. Cho S.G. Eom S.J. Lee H.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14107-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study we used the Ras recruitment system (RRS) (48Aronheim A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 49Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the objective to isolate novel JNK-associating proteins. JNK associates relatively tightly with its substrates, and after phosphorylation it rapidly dissociates from them (19Kallunki T., Su, B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 32Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 36Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). To obtain a more stable association between JNK and its potential substrates, we used a kinase-defective JNK mutant as bait to screen a myristoylated HeLa cell cDNA expression library. Five cDNA clones encoding proteins that specifically associated with JNK were isolated. The one showing the strongest association with JNK encoded a C-terminal fragment of IKAP (amino acids1040–1333) termed 102-IKAP. We confirmed the association of IKAP and JNK in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that the 102-fragment of IKAP could serve as a JNK substrate in vitro. Using confocal microscopy with three different detection methods, we found the vast majority of IKAP to localize in the cytosol. Co-expression of IKAP with MEKK1 or ASK1 enhanced JNK activation strongly and specifically. Importantly, ectopic expression of IKAP stimulated neither MEKK1-inducible IKK nor ASK1-inducible p38 activation. Moreover, IKAP efficiently potentiated JNK activation induced by various extracellular stimuli including ultraviolet light irradiation and treatments with either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or epidermal growth factor. We mapped the JNK association site in IKAP to its very C terminus. Overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of IKAP, 102-IKAP, was sufficient to induce JNK activity in co-operation with MEKK1. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a C-terminal deletion mutant of IKAP, IKAPΔC, which lacks the JNK association site, was not capable of further facilitating the MEKK1 or ultraviolet light-induced JNK activity. Thus, we showed that the C terminus of IKAP was responsible for the facilitation of JNK activity. Interestingly, this part of IKAP is deleted in sensory, sympathetic, and some parasympathetic neurons of patients affected by familial dysautonomia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by widespread sensory and variable autonomic dysfunction (5Anderson S.L.

IKAP fragment 102 was cloned using the yeast two-hybrid method, the RRS (48Aronheim A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 49Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The myristoylated yeast expression library was constructed from mRNA derived from HeLa cells induced with TNF and interleukin-1 for 30 min. The mRNA was primed with an oligo-dT primer containing anXhoI site and reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was ligated to EcoRI linkers. The cDNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pYesM Δ poly(A) plasmid (49Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The library consisted of 4 million independent transformants. The deletion mutants of 102-IKAP, 102-ΔC-IKAP and 102-RI-IKAP, were prepared by fusing corresponding fragments, encoding amino acids 1040–1216 and 1040–1279, respectively, in-frame with the v-Src myristoylation sequence into pYes expression vector. As bait we used dominant negative JNK1 (JNK1-KM; a gift from F. Dolfi), which was amplified from the HA-tagged pCMV5 expression vector coding for the JNK1-KM by polymerase chain reaction. The PCR product was cloned in-frame with mammalian Ras at its N terminus in alcohol dehydrogenase-Ras yeast expression vector (49Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using XmaI and HindIII sites. Corresponding yeast expression constructs were also made from the wild type JNK1. All yeast manipulations and screenings were performed as described (49Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 102-IKAP was also subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1His in-frame with the His/X-press tag at BamHI and NotI restriction sites. The 102-IKAP insert was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides IK-Myc-2 (5′-CGG GAT CCA TGA ACT TTA CCA AAG AC-3′) and IK-NotI (TCC TAA CTG CGG CCG CTC AGT CTA GCA GG-3′) to introduce it into the pCDNA expression vector. Full-length IKAP was obtained with polymerase chain reaction as two fragments utilizing the internal XbaI restriction site by using oligonucleotides IK-BamA (5′-CGG GAT CCA TGC GAA ATC TGA AAT TAT TTC GGA C-3′) and IK-XbaA (5′-AGA AAT CTG GTT ACT GGC ATC TAG AAC-3′) for the 5′ fragment and IK-XbaB (5′-TGA CCT TGC TGT TCT AGA TGC CAG TA-3′) and IK-NotI (described above) for the 3′ fragment according to the published IKAP sequence (1Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), so that both PCR products would together contain the full open reading frame of IKAP. A HeLa cell cDNA library (50Legerski R. Peterson C. Nature. 1992; 359: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was used as template. The obtained fragments were directly subcloned into the pXMyc expression vector betweenBamHI and NotI restriction sites. All 10 individual clones were sequenced, and 1 of the clones, pXMyc6–5, was chosen for further subcloning and analysis. IKAP was then cloned into pCDNA3.1His eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen®, catalog number V385–20). The IKAP cDNA was amplified by PCR using an upstream primer that generated aBamH1 site to fit the reading frame of the His/X-press tag of pCDNA3.1/HisA. The PCR product was digested withBamH1/XbaI and XbaI/NotI, and the two fragments was cloned into pCDNA31./HisA betweenBamHI and NotI sites. This PCR strategy removed the first eight codons of the IKAP reading frame. Primer sequences were as follows: upstream primer (5′-CGGATCCTGGAGTTCAGGGATATTCA-3′) and downstream primer (5′-TCC TAA CTG CGG CCG CTC AGT CTA GCA GG-3′). The IKAP C-terminal deletion construct pCDNA3.1His-IKAPΔC was also made by a PCR-based strategy. The pCDNA3.1His-102-IKAP was made with PCR using oligos Bam-IK2 (5′-CGG GAT CCA TGA ACT TTA CCA AAG-3′) for the upper strand and IK-NotI (described above) for the lower strand amplification. The HA-tagged IKAP C-terminal fragment (used in in vitro translation) was made by utilizing the endogenous NcoI site in IKAP, and thus, it contains amino acids 1070–1333 of IKAP fused in-frame with the HA tag of pSRα3, analogous to pSRα3-HA-c-Jun also used in this study. All the clones were verified by sequencing and Western blotting. To generate an in-frame C-terminal fusion of IKAP to green fluorescent protein (GFP), we amplified His/X-press-tagged IKAP cDNA from pCDNA3.1HisIKAP using primers 5′-GTCGACCCAAGCTGGCTAGCGTTTAAAC-3′ and 5′-TAGATCTAGCAGGCTCAGCTTCCACTGG-3′ and inserted it as aSalI/BglII restriction fragment between theXhoI and BamH1 sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH laboratories, Inc., catalog number PT3027-5). We term this plasmid pCMV-IKAP/GFP. All plasmid construction was verified by sequencing.

https://openalex.org/W2017562104,"Xenopus actin-interacting protein 1 (XAip1) is thought to promote fragmentation of actin filaments by cofilin. To examine the mechanism of XAip1, we measured polymer lengths by fluorescence microscopy and the concentration of filament ends with an elongation assay. Cofilin creates ends by severing actin filaments. XAip1 alone does not sever actin filaments or prevent annealing/redistribution of mechanically severed filaments and has no effect on the concentration of ends available for subunit addition. In the presence of XAip1, the apparent filament fragmentation by cofilin is enhanced, but XAip1 reduces rather than increases the concentration of ends capable of adding subunits. Electron microscopy with gold-labeled antibodies showed that a low concentration of XAip1 bound preferentially to one end of the filament. A high concentration of XAip1 bound along the length of the filament. In the presence of gelsolin-actin to cap filament barbed ends, XAip1 does not enhance cofilin activity. We conclude that XAip1 caps the barbed end of filaments severed by cofilin. This capping blocks annealing and depolymerization and allows more extensive severing by cofilin."

The identification of protein-binding heparan sulfate sequences is essential to our understanding of heparan sulfate biology and raises the possibility to develop drugs against diseases such as cancer and inflammatory conditions. We present proof-of-principle thatin vitro generated heparan sulfate oligosaccharide libraries can be used to explore interactions between heparan sulfate and proteins, and that the libraries expand the available heparan sulfate sequence space. Oligosaccharide libraries mimicking highly 6-O-sulfated domains of heparan sulfate were constructed by enzymatic O-sulfation of O-desulfated, end-group 3H-labeled heparin octasaccharides. Acceptor oligosaccharides that were 6-O-desulfated but only partially 2-O-desulfated yielded oligosaccharide arrays with increased ratio of iduronyl 2-O-sulfate/glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfate. The products were probed by affinity chromatography on immobilized growth factors, fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1) and FGF2, followed by sequence analysis of trapped oligosaccharides. An N-sulfated octasaccharide, devoid of 2-O-sulfate but with three 6-O-sulfate groups, was unexpectedly found to bind FGF1 as well as FGF2 at physiological ionic strength. However, a single 2-O-sulfate group in the absence of 6-O-sulfation gave higher affinity for FGF2. FGF1 binding was also augmented by 2-O-sulfation, preferentially in combination with an adjacent upstream 6-O-sulfate group.

HS binds to a large number of proteins and thus influences a variety of biological processes (1Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because of its postulated roles in various phenomena of clinical importance, such as wound healing, inflammation, tumor growth, and accompanying metastasis, there is increasing interest in the potential generation of drugs that may selectively interfere with HS-protein interactions. Alternatively, drugs could substitute for endogenous HS in agonist mode. Nevertheless, the anticoagulant action of heparin, based on interaction with the protease inhibitor antithrombin (4Bourin M.-C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), represents the only significant clinical application of HS-related saccharides so far. A major obstacle to further drug development is the lack of information regarding protein-binding epitopes in HS chains, as well as means of generating tailored saccharides. The HS carbohydrate backbone consists of alternating hexuronate (HexUA) and α-d-glucosamine monosaccharide units (2Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 5Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The HexUA can be either β-d-glucuronate (GlcUA) or α-l-iduronate (IdoUA). The amino group of the α-d-glucosamine is usually acetylated (GlcNAc) or sulfated (GlcNS), but it may also be unsubstituted. Within and adjacent to N-sulfated domains, 2-hydroxyl groups of IdoUA (IdoUA2S) or, less commonly, GlcUA, and 6-hydroxyl groups of GlcNS (GlcNS6S) or GlcNAc may be sulfated. Additionally, 3-O-sulfate groups can occur on GlcNS units. These modifications give rise to a large variety of different motifs along the HS chain, which usually consists of 50–400 monosaccharide units. Considering the heterogeneity of naturally occurring HS, the possibility of different proteins interacting with distinct HS epitopes is apparent. Indeed, following the development of HS sequencing methods (6Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Vivès R.R. Pye D.A. Salmivirta M. Hopwood J.J. Lindahl U. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

Attempts to identify protein-binding HS motifs have so far relied on HS isolated from tissues (10Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Owing to the structural variability of HS molecules from different cells (5Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 11Brickman Y.G. Ford M.D. Gallagher J.T. Nurcombe V. Bartlett P.F. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), there is an impending risk that a HS epitope assigned to interaction with a given protein in vivo may be poorly represented in a tissue-derived HS pool used for screening in vitro. We have therefore taken a novel approach, generating HS librariesin vitro, that are based on enzymatic O-sulfation of N-sulfated precursors. The potential of the library saccharides to functionally mimic HS domains was verified by their selective interactions with fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1) and FGF2. Separation of oligosaccharides of different size was performed by size-exclusion chromatography at a flow rate of 2 ml/h on a column (10 × 1500 mm) of Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.5 mNH4HCO3. Oligosaccharide solutions were desalted by size-exclusion chromatography using PD-10 columns (Sephadex G-25) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with H2O. Anion-exchange HPLC of oligosaccharides was performed using a ProPac PA1 column (Dionex, Surrey, UK), equilibrated with H2O, or with a NaCl solution, adjusted to pH 3 by addition of HCl. In analytical scale experiments, the column was connected to a 500 TR Flow Scintillation Analyzer (Packard, Meriden, CT). Samples were loaded, and NaCl gradients (10 mm/ml) were used to elute the oligosaccharides at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Unless otherwise indicated in legends to figures, the gradients started at [NaCl] = 0 (see “Results”). The procedure employed in library generation is outlined in Scheme FS1. Completely or partially O-desulfated heparin from bovine lung (Upjohn) was used to generate oligosaccharide substrates for library synthesis. 6-O-Sulfate and some 2-O-sulfate groups were removed by incubating 50 mg of heparin pyridinium salt with 2.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide containing 10% (v/v) methanol at 100 °C for 16 h (13Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Part of the product (10 mg), was completely 2-O-desulfated by dissolution in 10 ml of 30 mm NaOH, pH 12.5, followed by lyophilization (14Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1456Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The N/O-desulfated heparins were re-N-sulfated by incubation with 4.5 ml of 80 mm Na2CO3, 50 mm sulfur trioxide trimethylamine complex at 55 °C for 24 h (15Levy L. Petracek F.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 190: 901-905Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 6-O- and partially 2-O-desulfated preparation contained 42% -IdoUA2S-GlcNS- disaccharide units, but no detectable 6-O-sulfated components, as verified by disaccharide composition analysis (HNO2, pH 1.5, NaB3H4 procedure; Ref. 16Pejler G.

To obtain oligosaccharides, O-desulfated, re-N-sulfated heparin preparations (8 mg of completelyO-desulfated heparin in 800 μl and 1 mg of completely 6-O-desulfated, partially 2-O-desulfated heparin in 250 μl, respectively) were partially cleaved by treatment with 2.5 mm NaNO2, 70 mmH2SO4, pH 1.5 (17Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), on ice for 3 h. Reaction mixtures were adjusted to pH 8 by addition of 4 mNaOH, and oligosaccharides were then reduced with excess NaB3H4 (5 mCi, ∼60 Ci/mmol, AmershamBiosciences), yielding a 3H-labeled 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol (aManR) residue at the reducing end. Labeled oligosaccharides were separated with regard to size on the Bio-Gel P-10 column, and fractions corresponding to octasaccharides were recovered for enzymaticO-sulfation. Anion-exchange HPLC (ProPac PA1 column) of the extensivelyO-desulfated octasaccharide gave a predominant peak at the elution position expected for a fully N-sulfated 8-mer, devoid of O-sulfate groups (see “Results” and top panel in Fig. 1). Partial cleavage at GlcNS residues (HNO2, pH 1.5) (6Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Separate digestions of these oligosaccharide products with α-iduronidase and β-glucuronidase confirmed that most (>90%) of the hexuronates were IdoUA units, as expected for a heparin-derived material (data not shown). By contrast, the partially 2-O-sulfated octasaccharide preparation was highly heterogeneous, and contained components ranging from zero to fourO-sulfate groups per molecule. The elution pattern from the ProPac PA1 column was consistent with a stochastic mode of 2-O-desulfation (see “Results” and top panel in Fig. 3). This assumption was verified by sequence analysis (see below) of purified 8-mers, which revealed 2-O-sulfate groups in all potential positions (data not shown).FIG. 3Anion-exchange chromatography of octasaccharide substrate, complete Library 2, and subfractions separated with regard to affinity for FGF1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Before loading the sample, the column was equilibrated with a NaCl solution of the same concentration as the starting concentration of the gradient (0.2 M for the substrate octasaccharides, 0.25 m for the complete library, and 0.6m for the affinity-separated fractions). Library 2 was obtained by enzymatic O-sulfation of extensively 6-O-desulfated, partially 2-O-desulfated heparin octamer (SUBSTRATE panel). The fragments were eluted from the FGF1 column at the ionic strengths and yields indicated.

Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 463-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two enzyme preparations contained ∼30 and ∼20 mg of protein/ml, respectively, as judged by absorbance measurements. O-Sulfation reactions contained 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) at the concentrations indicated, 3–30 μm oligosaccharide (∼300 cpm3H/pmol), 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.5 μm NaF, 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 10–50% (v/v) microsomal fraction or 293-HEK cell lysate. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Two oligosaccharide libraries were generated. Completely O-desulfated octasaccharide, 50% of the final library, was incubated with 293-HEK cell lysate and 1 mm PAPS. Half of this reaction mixture was fortified with microsomal O-sulfotransferase and 5 mm PAPS and incubated for another 4 h. The remaining 50% was incubated with microsomal O-sulfotransferase and 5 mm PAPS only. All reaction products (2 × 107 cpm 3H) were then pooled to give Library 1. 6-O-Desulfated and partially 2-O-desulfated octasaccharide (5 × 106 cpm3H) was incubated with mastocytoma microsomalO-sulfotransferase and 5 mm PAPS. Before use, both libraries were adsorbed on DEAE-Sephacel (AmershamBiosciences), equilibrated with H2O, pH 3, to remove proteins, and then eluted with 1 m NaCl. The libraries were desalted by passage through PD-10 columns. Preparations of recombinant FGFs were as described (21Zazo M. Lozano R.M. Ortega S. Varela J. Dı́az-Orejas R. Ramı́rez J.M. Giménez-Gallego G. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Affinity columns were made by coupling primary amines in the proteins (1 mg) to activated esters in Activated CH Sepharose 4B gel matrix (1 g, dry weight), in a total volume of 4 ml according to the instructions of the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences). To protect lysine residues involved in binding of HS, FGF-Sepharose conjugates were prepared in the presence of heparin (5 mg), which had been treated with HNO2 at pH 3.9 to eliminate N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues (17Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The FGF columns were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and the respective octasaccharide library (∼2×106 cpm) was loaded. After washing the columns with buffer, bound octasaccharides were eluted using a stepwise NaCl gradient in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4. Octasaccharides were separated further by anion-exchange HPLC on the ProPac PA1 column. Molecular weights of oligosaccharides were determined by MALDI mass spectrometry as described (22Juhasz P. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Oligosaccharides (10 pmol) were directly dissolved in 4 μl of the matrix solution (12 mg of caffeic acid/ml in 50% aqueous acetonitrile) containing 20 pmol/ml basic peptide (Arg-Gly)19-Arg (Sigma-Genosys Ltd.). The peptide-oligosaccharide sample (1 μl) was then deposited on the stainless steel MALDI plate and dried at room temperature. Further sample purification was performed in situ on the MALDI target as described (24Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry measurements were performed on a Bruker Biflex III MALDI time-of-flight instrument (delayed extraction, mass gate set to 2000 Da) calibrated with cytochromec and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Purified and partially purified octasaccharides were subjected to3H-end label sequence analysis, based on a combination of chemical and exoenzymatic degradation steps (6Turnbull J.E. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Vivès R.R. Pye D.A. Salmivirta M. Hopwood J.J. Lindahl U. Gallagher J.T. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The enzymes used were from Oxford GlycoSciences (Abingdon, UK), except for glucosamine 6-sulfatase that was a gift from J. Hopwood (Adelaide, Australia). Briefly, oligosaccharides were subjected to partial deaminative cleavage at the sites of GlcNS units, and the products were separately digested with (i) iduronate 2-sulfatase, (ii) a mixture of iduronate 2-sulfatase and α-iduronidase, and (iii) a mixture of iduronate 2-sulfatase, α-iduronidase, and glucosamine 6-sulfatase (cf. “Results” and Fig. 4). The deamination and enzyme digestion products were analyzed on the ProPac PA1 column. Oligosaccharide libraries were obtained by subjecting variouslyO-desulfated, 3H-end-labeled heparin octasaccharides to enzymatic O-sulfation (SchemeFS1). Preliminary experiments with completely O-desulfated substrate, mastocytoma enzymes, and 5 mm PAPS resulted in appreciable O-sulfation of the fragments. Anion-exchange chromatography of the products showed non-, mono-, di-, and tri-O-sulfated major components in varying proportions depending on the precise conditions, whereas more highly sulfated species occurred in smaller amounts (data not shown). The sulfation afforded by the sulfotransferases was critically dependent on the PAPS concentration, as judged by the number and positions of peaks obtained on anion exchange chromatography; however, higher PAPS concentration than 5 mm did not further increase the degree of sulfation. Release of the terminal,3H-labeled disaccharide units by HNO2, pH 1.5, cleavage yielded nonsulfated disaccharide only, as shown by anion-exchange HPLC, indicating that the IdoUA-aManRsequence was not recognized as substrate for O-sulfation. Sequence analyses of isolated octasaccharides (not shown) indicated an average GlcNS6S:IdoUA2S ratio of ≥10:1. To increase the relative amount of 2-O-sulfate groups, the octasaccharide substrate was first exposed to recombinant 2-O-sulfotransferase expressed in 293-HEK cells (20Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 463-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the product was then further incubated with mastocytoma microsomal O-sulfotransferases, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to generate Library 1 (Fig. 1). Whereas the use of 2-O-sulfotransferase thus increased the 2-O-sulfate content (with ∼0.5 2-O-sulfate groups per octamer in the library), the octasaccharides provided by Library 1 still showed a higher 6-O-/2-O-sulfate ratio than commonly observed in N-sulfated domains of tissue-derived HS (8Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because many HS-protein interactions involve 2-O-sulfate groups (25Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we aimed at further increasing the degree of 2-O-sulfation by using a completely 6-O-desulfated, but only partially 2-O-desulfated, heparin octasaccharide preparation as substrate for the microsomal O-sulfotransferases. Again, extensive 6-O-sulfation of the fragments was obtained, resulting in a highly heterogeneous assembly of octasaccharides (Library 2; Fig. 3). The octasaccharides of Library 1 were probed for FGF2 binding using affinity chromatography on immobilized growth factor, and the resultant fractions of 3H-labeled octasaccharides were separated further by anion-exchange HPLC (Fig. 1). Most of the octasaccharides, including those without O-sulfate groups, were retained by FGF2 in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Adding 0.15 mNaCl (to attain I = 0.20) released most of the oligosaccharides from the column. The affinity fractions eluted betweenI = 0.25 and I = 0.55 contained distinct octasaccharides that apparently had been selected for. There was no simple relation between FGF2 affinity and oligosaccharide charge density, as illustrated by the occurrence of tri/tetra-O-sulfated, and mono-O-sulfated species in the I = 0.25 and I = 0.45 fractions, respectively (Fig. 1). Most of the oligosaccharides retained at higher ionic strengths were absent in the I = 0.20 fraction, demonstrating that the FGF2 column was not overloaded. Notably, the four major octasaccharide fragments of Library 1 were poorly retained by the FGF2 column at I > 0.20, and none remained bound at I > 0.25. However, the major tri-O-sulfated component a appeared in theI = 0.25 m fraction. To ascertain that this octasaccharide was indeed bound to FGF2 at physiological ionic strength (see “Discussion”), purified component a was reapplied onto the FGF2 column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 M NaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. The octasaccharide emerged with a peak elution position corresponding to I ∼ 0.3, thus at higher than physiological ionic strength (data not shown). Library 1 was also subjected to selection against immobilized FGF1 (Fig. 2). At least one of the octasaccharides retained on the FGF2 column bound also to FGF1 with appreciable affinity (component c in Figs. 1 and 2). However, most (if not all) of the other octasaccharides in the FGF1 affinity fractions differed from those in corresponding fractions from the FGF2 selection, reflecting the different requirements forO-sulfate groups in growth factor binding. Library 2, obtained through enzymatic O-sulfation of partially 2-O-desulfated, exhaustively 6-O-desulfated heparin octamer, was loaded onto the FGF1 affinity column. Again, distinct octasaccharide species emerged at the different ionic strengths used to develop the column (Fig.3). As seen for Library 1 with FGF1 as probe (Fig. 2), as well as previously for native HSN-sulfated domains (8Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the fractions showing highest affinity toward FGF1 contained predominantly highly sulfated oligosaccharides. However, selected octasaccharides of lower charge density remained bound to the growth factor at relatively high ionic strength, e.g. fragments e and g in Fig. 3, indicating selectivity in binding also to FGF1. Following purification on the ProPac PA1 column of the affinity-fractionated octamers, several oligosaccharides were sequenced using the strategy developed by Vivès et al.(7Vivès R.R. Pye D.A. Salmivirta M. Hopwood J.J. Lindahl U. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.4 shows an example of such analysis, of the fragments making up peak g in Fig. 3. Notably, the method enables concomitant analysis of mixtures of two (or even three) components, provided that their degree of sulfation is known (8Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The occurrence of two components in fraction g was indicated by the identification of two distinct disaccharides, IdoUA-[3H]aManR and IdoUA2S-[3H]aManR, following exhaustive deaminative cleavage of the end group-labeled parent fraction (data not shown). Accordingly, exoenzyme digestions of the products obtained by partial deamination revealed two distinct tetrasaccharides and also two hexasaccharides (Fig. 4). All structures deduced are shown in Fig.5. No GlcUA residues were found, except at the nonreducing terminus (unit 1) of fragment c. The relative molecular masses of three octasaccharides were determined as 1831 (a), 1672 (b), and 1754 (c), respectively, by MALDI mass spectrometry analysis, in agreement with the results of the sequencing. In vitro generated libraries are important tools in protein and nucleic acid biochemistry. For example, libraries of RNA, obtained by a combination of organic synthesis and RNA polymerase-catalyzed reactions, have been used to develop new catalytic RNA molecules (e.g. Ref. 26Johnston W.K. Unrau P.J. Lawrence M.S. Glasner M.E. Bartel D.P. Science. 2001; 292: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) with impact on the theories of the origin of life (27****Google Scholar). Enzyme libraries can be created by changing the corresponding genes in stochastic manner using, e.g., DNA shuffling (28Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). By expressing the variant genes, enzymes with improved or novel properties can be obtained (29Crameri A. Raillard S.-A. Bermudez E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 30Joo H. Lin Z. Arnold F.H. Nature. 1999; 399: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans constitute a large class of macromolecules of increasingly recognized biological significance. Their functional roles are largely expressed through interactions with proteins, and studies of recent years indicate that many such interactions depend critically on the fine structures of distinct saccharide domains. Attempts to define structure/function relationships for these polymers would benefit from the use of in vitro generated libraries. Although purely synthetic saccharide libraries are emerging (31Flitsch S.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Bartolozzi A. Seeberger P.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), this field is still in its infancy. Our present findings demonstrate that studies of complex HS-protein interactions are indeed amenable to a library approach, using a combined chemical and enzymatic strategy to generate diversity. This approach has several advantages over studies involving oligosaccharides derived from authentic HS. The starting point for library generation isN-sulfated but O-desulfated heparin oligosaccharides, relatively monodisperse with regard to molecular size compared with the heterogeneous fractions recovered after partial depolymerization of native HS. The products generated by enzymaticO-sulfation mimic N-sulfated domains from HS chains in their ability to bind FGF1 and FGF2. However, the in vitro generated HS-like oligosaccharides may reveal motifs that are expressed in vivo, but in such small amounts that they cannot be isolated from tissue-derived HS. Libraries of the types described thus expand the experimentally available HS sequence space, as shown through generation of highly 6-O-sulfated oligosaccharides devoid of 2-O-sulfate groups. Although 6-O-sulfation occurs adjacent to a preformed 2-O-sulfate group, the reverse order of events is prohibited because of the substrate specificities ofO-sulfotransferases involved (18Jacobsson I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5094-5100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This restriction is reflected by the excessive 6-O-sulfation observed following incubation of O-desulfated heparin oligomers with mixedO-sulfotransferases from mastocytoma tissue. The problem was partly alleviated by incubating the substrate with recombinant 2-O-sulfotransferase before further incubation with mixed O-sulfotransferases (Library 1). To achieve more extensive 2-O-sulfation, however, partially 2-O-desulfated, exhaustively 6-O-desulfated octamers were employed as substrate (Library 2). Sequence analysis of affinity-captured oligosaccharide species is an essential feature of our library strategy. This aim was achieved by enzymatic incorporation of unlabeled sulfate groups into [3H]end group-labeled oligosaccharide components, the radiolabel serving as the reference point required for alignment of exoenzyme-digested fragments (7Vivès R.R. Pye D.A. Salmivirta M. Hopwood J.J. Lindahl U. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Very recently, Wu et al. (34Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported a somewhat similar project, also based on enzymatic incorporation of sulfate groups into heparin-derived oligosaccharides. These experiments aimed primarily at defining the types of O-sulfate groups required for interaction with a given protein. However, the protocol employed did not involve isolation of protein-binding oligosaccharide species. Moreover, oligosaccharides were radiolabeled by use of 35S-labeled PAPS as sulfate donor, and thus were not readily amenable to sequence analysis. The pending availability of all the biosynthetic enzymes as heterologously expressed proteins will lead to further opportunities of expanding, as well as tailoring, HS libraries. In theory, it should be possible to generate all 128 conceivable 2-O-sulfated (four positions) and 6-O-sulfated (three positions) IdoUA-containing octasaccharides by fine-tuning of conditions and substrates. Further diversity of the oligosaccharides, with regard to the hexuronate, may be created by treatment of O-desulfated heparin ([4IdoUAα1–4GlcNS1α-]n) or of chemically N-sulfated capsular polysaccharide fromEscherichia coli K5 ([4GlcUAβ1–4GlcNSα1-]n), with GlcUA C5-epimerase, that catalyzes reversible C5 inversion of the HexUA units (35Hagner-McWhirter Å. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). “Composite” libraries may be produced by mixing products obtained by the separate approaches outlined. Future engineering of the biosynthetic enzymes may allow random or directed synthesis of enzyme-generated libraries in vitro, that cover the entire potential sequence space of a HS oligosaccharide. Although only a few of these options have been exploited so far, the applications of the oligosaccharide libraries to FGF binding demonstrate the potential of the approach, as novel aspects of FGF-HS interactions were revealed. The FGF1 and FGF2 targets were selected because octasaccharides derived from N-sulfated domains of authentic HS have been separated with regard to affinity for these growth factors and sequenced (8Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These HS oligomers represented primarily a section of the sequence space dominated by 2-O-sulfate groups, and affinity fractionation of such fragments against FGF2 highlighted 2-O-sulfate (along withN-sulfate) groups as essential for strong binding. 6-O-Sulfate groups on the other hand were considered insignificant (8Kreuger J.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the single 2-O-sulfate group on unit 3 confers appreciable affinity of library fragment b for FGF2. Nevertheless, fragmenta, with three 6-O-sulfates but no 2-O-sulfate group, binds FGF2 at physiological ionic strength (Figs. 1 and 5). A sulfation pattern similar to that of fragment a is quite unusual in authentic HS, but may explain why murine cells deficient in 2-O-sulfotransferase could rescue FGF2-dependent receptor signaling by increasing 6-O-sulfation of HS (41Merry C.L.R. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S.P. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups are important for the interaction of HS with FGF1, and an -IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S- trisaccharide motif comprising units 3–5 was implicated with high affinity binding. A shift of the 6-O-sulfate group from unit 4 to unit 2 leads to appreciable loss of affinity (8Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The specific trisaccharide motif was also identified in the high affinity library fragmentsg1 and h. However, determinants for FGF1 binding could be further qualified through the present library approach. For example, comparison of g1 andg2 shows that the -IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S- motif is not obligatory for strong binding. Addition of a 2-O-sulfate group on unit 3 of g2 or unit 7 of g1 yields fragment h. Hence, for fragment h, these 2-O-sulfate groups contribute about equally to the affinity. Further, the structure/affinity relations for fractions e1,e2 and f1,f2, f3 suggest that octasaccharides with two or three adjacent 6-O-sulfate groups, will gain affinity for FGF1 (cf. fragmentd) by the presence of a single 2-O-sulfate group regardless of its position. Still, the combined effects of the 2-O-substituents are reflected by the high affinities of fragments g1, g2, andh (Fig. 5). These findings again emphasize the expanded sequence space of the in vitro generated libraries that may be exploited to probe the functional roles of different motifs and individual residues. In HS biosynthesis 2-O-sulfation generally precedes 6-O-sulfation, and the distribution of the latter substituents appears to be quite strictly regulated (12Safaiyan F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42Merry C.L.R. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas excessively 6-O-sulfated sequences such as that displayed by fragment a are rarely seen in nonmanipulated systems, 2-O- and 6-O-sulfated structures ofg and h type may be detected in authentic HS (8Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,42Merry C.L.R. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the high affinity for FGF1 (and other growth factors) expressed by these structures, as compared with weaker binders, remains unclear. Conceivably, a gradient of HS motifs with increasing affinities may serve to capture and direct a growth factor molecule toward the site of interaction with its tyrosine kinase receptor target at the cell surface (43Lander A.D. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude that high affinity binding may sequester growth factors at sites on HS chains out of reach for receptor interaction. Productive interaction appears to depend on binding of not only FGF but also its receptor to the same HS chain (25Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It will therefore be important to isolate and structurally characterize HS domains capable of accommodating both proteins in a ternary complex. In conclusion, the oligosaccharide libraries obtained in the current work present a novel tool to explore protein-HS interactions. Other potential applications include the analysis of substrate specificity for biosynthetic enzymes such as sulfotransferases. Finally, the technique may be useful in guiding future enzyme engineering toward catalysts that can generate tailored HS oligosaccharides, for use as reagents in research or even as drugs."

GFAP is most abundant in mature astrocytes, and the expression is induced by astrocytic activation and accordingly during aging. Two other class III IF proteins, nestin and vimentin, dominate in immature astrocytes, whereas vimentin and GFAP are the main IF proteins in mature astrocytes. The human GFAP is a 432-amino acid-long polypeptide of 55 kDa encoded by the GFAP gene on chromosome 17q21 (3Reeves S.A. Helman L.J. Allison A. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genomics. 1998; 51: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GFAP shows a high degree of homology among species (3Reeves S.A. Helman L.J. Allison A. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The astrocytic mRNA of 2.9 kb represents the dominating GFAP isoform (GFAPα) in the central nervous system (3Reeves S.A. Helman L.J. Allison A. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Isoform GFAPβ transcription starts 169 nucleotides upstream of GFAPα and was described in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (9Feinstein D.L. Weinmaster G.A. Milner R.J. J. Neurosci.

Res. 1995; 41: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); GFAPγ mRNA is about 2.4 kb and lacks exon 1 but includes the last 126 nucleotides of intron 1. GFAPγ is expressed outside the brain (11Zelenika D. Grima B. Brenner M. Pessac B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); the mRNA of GFAPδ is 4.2 kb and includes all 9 GFAP exons and, in addition, the last 1255 bp of intron 7 spliced in frame to exon 7 (12Condorelli D.F. Nicoletti V.G. Barresi V. Conticello S.G. Caruso A. Tendi E.A. Giuffrida Stella A.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The derived hypothetical GFAPδ protein has a new tail domain where the normal C-terminal 42 amino acids encoded by exons 8 and 9 have been replaced by the 33 amino acids encoded by intron 7 sequences used as exon (12Condorelli D.F.

Missense mutations in the tail domain and the rod domain of GFAP have been implicated in the neurodegenerative process of Alexander disease where astrocytes accumulate GFAP-containing cytoplasmic aggregates (13Brenner M. Johnson A.B. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Rodriguez D. Goldman J.E. Messing A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel human GFAP isoform designated GFAPε. GFAPε has a novel C-terminal tail domain, the integrity of which is required for binding to the Alzheimer's disease-associated transmembrane proteins presenilin 1 and 2 in yeast and in vitro (14Thinakaran G.

Neurol. 2000; 13: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, GFAPε represents a functionally distinct isoform in terms of presenilin interactions, and this finding suggests a direct link between presenilins and the cytoskeleton. Details on individual plasmid constructs, which were all verified by sequencing, are available upon request. Human cDNA for GFAPα was cloned by PCR from a brain cDNA library. Point mutations were generated as described for QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). For yeast two-hybrid assays, DBD and AAD fusion proteins were expressed from the yeast multicopy plasmids pBTM116m (16Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and pGAD10 (CLONTECH), respectively. His6-tagged constructs were obtained by subcloning the indicated cDNAs into pRSETB (Invitrogen). For GST pull-down experiments and far Westerns, cDNA was subcloned into pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences). For mammalian expression pSG5 (16Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or green fluorescent fusion vector pEGFP (CLONTECH) was used. A yeast GAL4 activation domain tagged cDNA library derived from human fetal brain (CLONTECH) was introduced by LiAc transformation into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 strain expressing the fusion protein LexA-PS-1-(1–85) from the pBTM116m vector. Approximately 6 × 106 yeast transformants were selected on Trp−Leu− plates containing 2 mm3-aminotriazole. After 5 days His− clones that havelacZ expression on X-gal indicator plates were isolated. Library plasmids were rescued in Escherichia coli strain JM110 (leuB−) and introduced back into L40 expressing either unfused LexA or different LexA fusion proteins. Positives for interaction specifically with LexA-PS-1-(1–85) were DNA sequence analyzed. Yeast L40 transformants were grown exponentially for about five generations in selective medium. Yeast extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase activity essentially as described by Roseet al. (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). For Northern blotting experiments a mouse 298-bp fragment specific for exon 7a was amplified by PCR, purified, and randomly labeled with radioactivity. The probe was hybridized onto a mouse tissue MTN blot (CLONTECH) overnight at 65 °C in 5× SSPE (0.9m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 4 mm EDTA), 0.02 mg/ml carrier DNA, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.5% (w/v) SDS. The filter was washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in 2× SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, twice for 15 min at 65 °C with 1× SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and for high stringency twice for 10 min at 65 °C with 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The blot was revealed by autoradiography. For RT-PCR mouse brain RNA was prepared according to the protocol for the TRI Reagent (Sigma). RT-PCR was done according to the protocol for the Titanium One-step RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, 1 μg of mouse brain RNA was reverse-transcribed at 50 °C for 1 h and subsequently PCR-amplified (94 °C, 30 s; 62 °C, 30 s; and 68 °C, 1 min) for the indicated number of cycles. The following primers were used for the PCR: mGFAP exon 7 forward (PE7f), CATCACCATTCCTGTACAGACTTTC; mGFAP exon 8 reverse (PE8r), CCACGATGTTCCTCTTGAGGTG; and mGFAP exon 7a reverse (PE7ar), CCATTTACAATCTGGTGAGCCTG. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. GST and GST-PS-1-(1–85) fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli XL1-blue, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and GST pull-down assays performed essential as described (18Nielsen A.L.

His6 epitope-tagged GFAP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified on Ni2+-chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences). Labeling of GST fusion proteins and far Western experiments were done exactly as described (20Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GFAPε antibody was raised in rabbit against a fusion protein GST-GFAPε-(390–431) consisting of GST fused to amino acids 390–431 of GFAPε. The polyclonal antibody was designated pAb-GFAPε. In Western blotting the antibody was used in a 1:800 dilution. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used in a 1:1000 dilution. His tag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used in a 1:2000 dilution. In epi-immunofluorescence experiments pAb-GFAPε was used in a 1:300 dilution; FLAG antibody 1B11 (18Nielsen A.L.

For epi-immunofluorescence analysis cells were grown in slide flasks (Nunc), and to induce cytoskeletal rearrangement medium was changed to serum-free media 24 h after transfection. After a further 24 h of incubation, cells were washed twice in PBS, and fixed in 2%para-formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. The fixated cells were washed in PBS, and antibody incubations were done in PBS, 5% fetal calf serum for 1 h at 4 °C. To generate the Triton-insoluble cell fraction enriched in cytoskeletal proteins, cells were washed twice in PBS and scraped off the culture dishes. After centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet was homogenized in 170 mm NaCl, 600 mm KCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 6 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (homogenate fraction, HO). After centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 10 min the supernatant was restored (TSE fraction), and the pellet was washed twice in PBS and resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer (TIE fraction). Triton-insoluble extracts from brain material were similarly prepared except for the inclusion of an additional Triton extraction step. The GenBankTM accession number for the human GFAPε exon 7a sequence is AJ306447. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cDNAs encoding proteins with a capacity for interacting with PS-1. A fusion between the DBD of the LexA protein and the N-terminal 85-amino acid cytoplasmic region of PS-1, DBD-PS-1-(1–85), was used as a bait to screen a library of human fetal brain cDNAs fused to the yeast GAL4 activation domain (AAD). Around 6 × 106 yeast transformants were screened, and those that grew on selective histidine-deficient yeast plates and showed positive X-gal indication were isolated. The isolated cDNAs were used for yeast retransformation, and cDNAs were sequenced from transformants that were positive for interaction with PS-1, but negative for interaction with an unfused DBD or DBD fusions to unrelated proteins. Five cDNAs isolated were shown by BLAST sequence homology searches to have high homology to the DNA sequence of the gene coding for the human GFAP. Four of the five cDNA isolates were identical and encoded an entire GFAP protein except for the three N-terminal residues. They were named GFAP46. The sequence of the fifth cDNA isolate, named GFAP21, was shorter and included in the GFAP46 sequence. In a liquid β-galactosidase assay we tested the capacity of AAD-GFAP21 and AAD-GFAP46 to interact with DBD-PS-1-(1–85) or DBD-PS-2-(1–93) and thereby activated an integrated LexA cis-element regulated yeast lacZ promoter. DBD-PS-2-(1–93) and DBD-PS-1-(1–85) interacted equally well with AAD-GFAP21 and AAD-GFAP46 (Fig. 1a). No measurable increase in β-galactosidase activity was observed by co-transforming AAD-GFAP21 and AAD-GFAP46 with DBD fused to the PS-1 cytoplasmic loop (PS-1-(257–376)), PS-1 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (PS-1-(405–446)), or unrelated bait constructs (Fig. 1a). By DBD and AAD domain swapping a similar interaction was observed between DBD-GFAP46 and AAD-PS-1-(1–85) (data not shown). To examine a direct interaction between GFAP46 and PS-1, a fusion protein of GST and PS-1 amino acids 1–85, GST-PS-1-(1–85), was expressed in E. coli and purified. GFAP46 was expressed inE. coli as a fusion protein with a His6 tag (His-GFAP46). The His6 tag was used for purification of the protein by nickel column chromatography. The purified protein components were used in a GST pull-down assay. GST and GST-PS-1-(1–85) were bound to an glutathione S-Sepharose matrix and thereafter incubated with His-GFAP46. After extensive washings, the retained protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and visualized by an antibody against the His6 tag. The input lane (Fig. 1b) corresponds to 1/10 of the material used in each GST pull-down assay. GST-PS-1-(1–85) retained a substantial amount of His-GFAP46 ensuring a direct interaction in vitro. The sequences of GFAP21 and GFAP46 cDNA inserts revealed identity to the 5′-region of the normal human GFAP transcript, GFAPα, but differed completely in the 3′-region (Fig.2) (3Reeves S.A. Helman L.J. Allison A. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5178-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Bongcam-Rudloff E. Nister M. Betsholtz C. Wang J.L. Stenman G. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Westermark B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1553-1560PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that the GFAP21 and GFAP46 cDNAs represent a new mRNA splice product of the human GFAP gene which we designated GFAPε. BLAST homology searches identified homology between the 3′-region of the GFAP21 and GFAP46 cDNAs and sequences included in a newly identified rat 4.2-kb GFAP splice variant designated GFAPδ (12Condorelli D.F. Nicoletti V.G. Barresi V. Conticello S.G. Caruso A. Tendi E.A. Giuffrida Stella A.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that the divergence between GFAPα and GFAPε was the result of usage of a part of GFAP gene intron 7 as an exon in GFAPε (Fig.2b) (5Isaacs A. Baker M. Wavrant-De Vrieze F. Hutton M. Genomics. 1998; 51: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The new consensus splice acceptor site was identified in the genomic sequence (Fig. 2c). The new exon utilized in GFAPε was designated exon 7a. A perfect match with the polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, was present in the extreme 3′-end of exon 7a, denoted pAε (Fig. 2). The sequence of GFAP46 cDNA showed polyadenylation 26 bases downstream of the polyadenylation signal in exon 7a which therefore was functional in human cells (Fig.2b). Moreover, the sequence of the mouse GFAP gene showed that splice acceptor sites corresponding to the alternative exon 7a splicing and the polyadenylation signal were evolutionary conserved (Fig. 2c). By usage of pAε, exon 8 and exon 9 are skipped and the size of the human and mouse GFAPε mRNAs will be 1.8 and 2.5 kb, respectively. Note that in mouse the GFAPα and GFAPε mRNAs will have roughly same molecular weight. GFAPε mRNA was detected solely in the brain in Northern blot experiments by using human or mouse brain mRNA probed with exon 7a sequences (Fig.2d and data not shown). The relative expression levels of the two GFAP isoforms were determined by RT-PCR. Mouse brain RNA was in a coupled RT-PCR amplified with either a GFAPε-specific, a GFAPα-specific, or a mixed primer set. The RT-PCR was run for a variable number of cycles to ensure reaction points in which the PCR amplification was exponentially increasing. The relative expression level of GFAPε mRNA was estimated to be about 20-fold less than that of GFAPα mRNA (Fig. 2e). The alternative splicing of GFAPε mRNA was translated into a unique tail domain of GFAPε. The 43-amino acid C-terminal tail region of GFAPα encoded by exon 8 and exon 9 in GFAPε was replaced by the 42 amino acids encoded by exon 7a (Fig. 2f). This GFAPε-specific tail domain showed only little homology to GFAPα or other IF protein sequences (Fig. 2f). To detect the region in PS-1 responsible for the GFAPε interaction, we introduced a series of N- and C-terminal deletions and missense mutations in DBD-PS-1-(1–85) and assayed for interaction with AAD-GFAPε-(3–431) in the two-hybrid system (Fig.3a). As exemplified by the fusion protein DBD-PS-1-(66–85), deletion of the first 65 of the N-terminal residues does not influence the AAD-GFAPε interaction, and DBD-PS-1(1–85del-(66–72)), in which a highly acidic stretch of amino acids (66–72) has been deleted, also retained the capacity for interaction. By contrast, removal of only three amino acids from the C-terminal end, as exemplified by DBD-PS-1-(1–82), completely abolished interaction. The same effect was seen if these residues were changed by single or double missense mutations. We noted that interaction was abolished in the non-conservative amino acid substitutions V82K and V82E but was retained in DBD-PS-1(V82L) which carried a conservative amino acid substitution associated with familial Alzheimer's disease. Also DBD-PS-1(A79V) that is associated with Alzheimer's disease had no effect on GFAP binding (Fig.3a). To map the amino acids in GFAPε which take part in the PS-1 interaction, we utilized the far Western assay to monitor protein-protein interactions. Various deletions of GFAPε were expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins to a His tag, purified, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was probed with 32P-labeled GST-PS-1-(1–85), and after an extensive wash, the retained radioactivity was monitored by autoradiography. As expected, GST-PS-1-(1–85) interacts with His-GFAPε-(3–431) and His-GFAPε-(204–431) which correspond to the sequences of GFAP46 and GFAP21, respectively (Fig. 3b, left panel). Labeled GST did not interact with these proteins (data not shown). His-GFAPε-(309–431) and His-GFAPε-(349–431) were negative for GST-PS-1-(1–85) interaction showing that sequences in the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil region, which is conserved among the different GFAP splice variants, are required for PS-1 interaction (Fig.3b, left panel). Because His-GFAPε-(204–390) was also negative for GST-PS-1-(1–85) interaction, the GFAPε-specific C-terminal tail sequences were also required for PS-1 interaction (Fig. 3b). Purified full-length GFAPα was found not to interact with GST-PS-1-(1–85) as expected because it did not include the PS-1 interaction region (Fig. 3b, right panel). By Western blotting using an antibody against the histidine tag, it was verified that an equal amount of proteins was used for the far Western analysis (Fig. 3c). We also used the yeast two-hybrid system to define the GFAP residues required for PS-1 interaction at more physiological conditions. Consistent with the far Western results AAD-GFAPε-(204–431) interacted with DBD-PS-1-(1–85), whereas deletion of GFAP sequences in the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil region in both AAD-GFAPε-(309–431), AAD-GFAPε-(349–431), and AAD-GFAPε-(390–431) completely abolished the interaction (Fig.3d). The region between amino acids 204 and 309 includes the linker 1–2, coiled-coil 2A, and the beginning of coiled-coil 2B. The deletion of exon 7a encoded amino acids in AAD-GFAPε-(204–390) also abolished PS-1 interaction (Fig. 3d). In conclusion, the PS-1 interaction domain in GFAPε is large or bipartite and requires both the GFAPε-specific tail sequence as well as sequences overlapping with the coiled-coil 2 and linker 1–2 shared by GFAPα and GFAPε. Full-length GFAPα was also tested for interaction with PS-1 and in agreement with the above mapping data and the far Western results (Fig. 3b) no interaction was observed between DBD-PS-1-(1–85) and AAD-GFAPα. 293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding GFP alone or fused to the N-terminal of GFAPα (pGFP-GFAPα) or GFAPε (pGFP-GFAPε). Cellular extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using either an antibody against GFP or a pAb-GFAPε that was raised in rabbit against the 42-amino acid C-terminal tail region specific for the GFAPε isoform (Fig.4a). Although the GFP antibody detected both GFP fusion proteins, the GFAPε antibody recognizes only GFAPε (lane 3) thus ensuring the antibody specificity. The Western blot in Fig. 4b shows GFAPε expression in 293 cells transfected with the expression vector pSG5 without insert (lane 1), with the GFAPε insert (lane 2), and a total cellular extract from the astrocyte-derived cell line SVG(P12) (lane 3). The antibody pAb-GFAPε detected in lane 3 an endogenous band of the expected GFAPε size (55 kDa) co-migrating with transfected untagged GFAPε (lane 2). When the antibody was pre-adsorbed with the GFAPε antigen the endogenous band of the SVG(P12) extract disappeared, whereas pre-adsorption with GST did not affect reactivity of the antibody (Fig.4c). By fractionation of SVG(P12) cells to obtain the Triton X-100-insoluble extract (TIE) enriched in cytoskeletal proteins, GFAPε localization was determined to be in the TIE fraction in agreement with GFAPε being an intermediate filament protein (Fig.4d). Also in a porcine brain extract a protein with the expected size of GFAPε was observed in the TIE fraction enriched in cytoskeletal proteins together with a 35-kDa immunoreactivity of unknown origin (Fig. 4e) Thus the alternative GFAP splicing seems to be reflected in the expression of the corresponding GFAPε protein in vivo. To examine the subcellular localization of GFAPε, we transfected the mammalian N2A neuroblastoma cell line with an expression vector encoding full-length GFAPε. The GFAPε protein was detected by pAb-GFAPε and a fluorescence-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. In the transfected N2A cells GFAPε was incorporated into a structural network further supporting that GFAPε is an intermediate filamentous protein (Fig. 4f). GFAPε and GFAPα tails strongly diverge as seen in Fig. 2. The GFAP tail has been shown previously to be involved in correct filament incorporation (27Chen W.J. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2299-2311PubMed Google Scholar). To compare GFAPε and GFAPα incorporation into filaments, we fused the cDNAs to N- and C-terminal GFP tags. N2A cells were transfected with the GFP constructs, and the subcellular localization was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Unfused GFP was dispersed throughout the entire cell (Fig. 5f). GFAPε fusion proteins carrying either N- or C-terminal GFP tags were localized to a filamentous network (Fig. 5, a and b). Also N- or C-terminal GFP-tagged GFAPα was located in filamentous networks in the transfected N2A cells (Fig. 5, cand d). The fluorescence pattern of the neurofilament protein NFL, GFP-tagged at its N terminus, is shown in Fig.5e as a cytoskeletal reference. To examine subcellular co-localization of GFAPα and GFAPε, a double labeling approach was utilized where N-terminal GFP-tagged GFAPα and untagged GFAPε were transfected into N2A cells. GFAPε was specifically labeled by the pAb-GFAPε antibody and stained with a red fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody (Fig.6). By merging the GFP and red fluorescent-stained cells, a perfect overlap in localization was observed indicating that the two GFAP isoforms were polymerized into the same filamentous structures. Furthermore, we examined the co-localization between GFAPε and PS-1. For this N-terminal GFP-tagged GFAPε and N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged PS-1 were transfected into N2A cells. The PS-1 localization was determined by an anti-FLAG antibody and a red fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody. As already extensively documented, PS-1 localized to the perinuclear region and cytoplasmic granules. Consequently, we observed that a subpopulation of the GFAPε pool co-localized with PS-1 (Fig. 6). Glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP (isoform GFAPα), is one of the main intermediary filament proteins of the astrocytic cytoskeleton. Here we describe a novel isoform of human GFAP, designated GFAPε. The corresponding GFAPε mRNA is the result of alternative splicing where exon 8 and exon 9 of the GFAPα transcript are substituted by a new exon, designated exon 7a, located in intron 7 of the GFAP gene. Exon 7a is flanked by splice consensus sequences in the 5′-end and a polyadenylation signal in the 3′-end. In addition we identified the corresponding mouse GFAPε transcript that is expressed predominantly in the brain (Fig. 2). GFAPε mRNA was determined to be about 20-fold less expressed than GFAPα mRNA (Fig. 2), a ratio in accordance with the relative abundance of EST clones of each isoform. The GFAPε mRNA-derived human protein, GFAPε, is 431 amino acids long, one amino acid shorter than GFAPα, and has a deduced molecular mass of 55 kDa. The GFAPε protein was identified in central nervous system derived cell lines and in a porcine brain extract and had Triton X-100 extraction characteristics as expected of a cytoskeletal protein (Fig. 4). The head and rod regions of GFAPε are identical to the head and rod regions of GFAPα. But the tail region of GFAPε encoded by exon 7a is completely different from the tail region of GFAPα encoded by exons 8 and 9. This difference in the tail regions suggested different functions of GFAPε and GFAPα, and it might be significant that the tail region of GFAPα is almost 100% conserved, whereas the tail in GFAPε allows for 25% divergence between the human and mouse sequences (Fig. 2f). It has been suggested recently (21Sych M. Hartmann H. Steiner B. Mueller W.E. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 22Zhang W. Han S.W. McKeel D.W. Goate A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that PS-1, in particular the 30-kDa N-terminal fragment of the protease processed PS-1, interacts with cytoskeletal proteins. High expression of both PS-1 and GFAP is observed in astrocytes associated with cerebral infarction and astrocytoma (24Miake H. Tsuchiya K. Nakamura A. Ikeda K. Levesque L. Fraser P.E. George Hyslop P.H. Mizusawa H. Uchihara T. Acta Neuropathol. 1999; 98: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and in reactive astrocytes surrounding the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (25Weggen S. Diehlmann A. Buslei R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3279-3283PubMed Google Scholar). The GFAPε transcript was identified by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library for translation products capable of binding PS-1 (Fig. 1). The tail of GFAPε is indispensable for the PS-1 binding in yeast and in vitro and cannot be replaced by the exon 8- and exon 9-encoded tail of GFAPα (Fig. 3). Moreover, sequences overlapping coiled-coil region 2 common to GFAPε and GFAPα are required for PS-1 binding. IF proteins form polymers where the rod domain promotes formation of a coiled-coil dimer between two parallel IF proteins. The dimers associate in an antiparallel manner to form a nonpolarized tetrameric substructure where coiled-coil region 1 from one dimer is associated with coiled-coil 2 from the other dimer. The tetrameric structure appears to be the fundamental subunit from which the IF is assembled. The head domain seems to govern both end-to-end and lateral associations, whereas the tail domain may project from the surface of the filament and mediate interaction with other cellular components (1Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 197-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The variable tail domain may thus confer cell-specific property of the IF proteins (26Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PS-1 and PS-2 interact with the GFAPε tail and coiled-coil region 2. Such an interaction would leave coiled-coil region 1 free to interact with coiled-coil region 2 of another anti-parallel dimer during fiber formation and link a presenilin-containing membrane to the cytoskeleton. Note that a fraction of PS-1 is associated with the ε-cadherin-catenin complex, which serves as a cytoskeletal attachment site on the plasma membrane and has a function in cell-cell communication (28Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mehta P. Friedrich V.L. Robakis N.K. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Similarly, the observed co-localization between a subpopulation of GFAPε and PS-1 might be in agreement with a function of the GFAPε and PS-1 interaction as a linkage between different structures within the cell. The RDG motif present in the tail of GFAPα has been implicated in correct filament formation based on C-terminal deletion studies and is evolutionarily conserved in type III IF proteins (27Chen W.J. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2299-2311PubMed Google Scholar). The RDG motif is absent from the tail region of GFAPε. However, in transfected cells GFAPε can assemble into filaments (Figs. 4 and 5). This filament formation was indistinguishable from the filament formation with GFP-tagged GFAPα. Accordingly, co-localization was observed between GFAPα and GFAPε in transfected N2A cells (Fig. 6). The observed filamentous incorporation could be due to heteromeric assembly with endogenous intermediate filament proteins. It should be noted that we have been unable to monitor direct interactions between the neurofilament proteins and GFAPε at least in the yeast two-hybrid system, whereas GFAPα and GFAPε interact with each other (data not shown). Amino acids 1–65 of the PS-1-(1–85) fragment can be removed without any effect on the binding capacity of GFAPε, whereas amino acids 83–85 are essential for the binding capacity. Also valine at position 82 seems critical because nonconservative substitution abolished binding to GFAPε. We note that the sequence motif in PS-1 required for GFAPε interaction is highly conserved between presenilin proteins throughout evolution. Because of the PS-1 association with familial Alzheimer's disease, we also tested the pathogenic conservative substitutions valine to leucine at position 82 and alanine for valine at position 79 and found no effect on the GFAPε binding. This was not unexpected because the pathogenic effect of these two mutations is not different from that of the other known disease-causing mutations scattered outside the PS-1-(1–85) region. Mutation in the GFAP gene has recently been associated with Alexander disease, in which GFAP-containing inclusion bodies in astrocytes is a pathological hallmark (13Brenner M. Johnson A.B. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Rodriguez D. Goldman J.E. Messing A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The identified mutations are located in the tail and rod domains of GFAPα and the latter therefore expressed in GFAPε. Our observations suggest that the isoform GFAPε is relevant to consider in studies of neurodegenerative diseases. We thank Dr. P. Fraser, Toronto, Canada, for PS-1 and PS-2 cDNAs."

The Ras-like GTPase Rsr1/Bud1 and its regulators are required for selection of a specific site for growth.

We also showed that localization of Cdc24, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Cdc42 GTPase, to the proper bud site was dependent on Rsr1/Bud1. Surprisingly, Rsr1/Bud1 also localized to intracellular membranes. A mutation in the lysine repeat in the hypervariable region of Rsr1/Bud1 specifically abolished its plasma membrane localization, whereas a mutation at the CAAX motif eliminated both plasma membrane and internal membrane association of Rsr1/Bud1. Thus the lysine repeat and the CAAX motif of Rsr1/Bud1 are important for its localization to the plasma membrane and to the polarized growth sites. This localization of Rsr1/Bud1 is essential for its function in proper bud site selection because both mutations resulted in random bud site selection.

One of the key questions in understanding the molecular basis of cell polarity is how specific sites for actin polymerization are determined. To understand the mechanism of action of the Rsr1 GTPase module, it is crucial to determine whether any of its components are localized to the presumptive bud site. We reported previously that both Bud2 and Bud5 are localized to the presumptive bud site and to discrete sites during the cell cycle (10Park H.-O. Sanson A. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Kang P.J. Sanson A. Lee B. Park H.-O. Science. 2001; 292: 1376-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This localization is essential for selection of a specific site for growth. Here we report that Rsr1 is broadly distributed on the plasma membrane and is highly concentrated at the incipient bud site and polarized growth sites. Mutational studies indicated that the lysine repeat in the hypervariable region and the CAAX motif of Rsr1 are important for its localization and its role in selection of a proper site for growth. We also show that localization of Cdc24, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42, to the proper bud site is dependent on Rsr1. Yeast genetic manipulations were performed as described previously (12-Google Scholar). Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table I. Cdc24-green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 was expressed using plasmid pYS47 (a gift from M. Peter) (13Shimada Y. Gulli M.-P. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). YEp13-rsr1G12V and YEp13-rsr1K16N were gifts from M. Ruggieri (14Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the wild-type and mutantrsr1 as GFP or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions are described below. To express Rsr1 fused to GFP, first a NotI site was introduced right after the start codon of RSR1 in PB290 (a gift from A. Bender) (4Bender A. Pringle J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9976-9980Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), resulting in pHP764. A 720-bpNotI fragment coding for GFP(S65T,V163A,S175G) was amplified by PCR from pAFS144 (a gift from A. F. Straight) (15Straight A.F. Sedat J.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and cloned into the NotI site of pHP764, resulting in plasmid pHP767. To construct an integrating plasmid, theSacI-SalI fragment of pHP767 was cloned into pRS304, resulting in pHP808. A haploid α strain expressing GFP-Rsr1 (HPY401) was constructed by integration of pHP808 digested withBssHII into the RSR1 locus of an αrsr1Δ strain (HPY263). A diploid a/α strain expressing GFP-Rsr1 (HPY618) was constructed using strain HPY401 and the plasmid pRS315-HO. Similarly, a plasmid expressing YFP-Rsr1 (pHP818) was generated by PCR using the plasmid pDH5 as a template (a gift from Yeast Biology Resource Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The rsr1G12V andrsr1K16N alleles were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pHP818 as a template. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids, pHP843 and pHP844, were integrated into the RSR1 locus of an αrsr1Δ strain (HPY263), resulting in HPY422 and HPY423, respectively. Thersr1C269S mutation was introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using pHP808 as a template, resulting in pHP1042. The rsr1K260–264S mutation was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis in two steps. First,rsr1K263–264S was generated using pHP808 as a template. The resulting plasmid, pHP1041, was then used as a template to generate the rsr1K260–264S mutation, resulting in pHP1065. The plasmids pHP1042 and pHP1065 were integrated into the RSR1 locus of HPY263, resulting in HPY590 and HPY621, respectively. To view GFP-Rsr1 or YFP-Rsr1, cells were grown to early log phase and visualized using a Nikon E800 microscope fitted with a 100× immersion objective (N.A. = 1.30) as described previously (10Park H.-O. Sanson A. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using filters from Chroma (Brattleboro, VT). Images were collected using a Micromax digital camera (Princeton Instruments) and IPLab software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). To collect images of several Z-sections, motorized stage movement was driven using PerkinElmer Life Sciences Imaging Suite software (version 4.1). Bud scars and birth scars were visualized by staining cells with Calcofluor as described previously (16Pringle J.R. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology. 194. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 732-735Google Scholar). The vacuole lumen was visualized using CellTracker Blue CMAC (Molecular Probes) as suggested in the manufacturer's protocol. To stain DNA in living cells expressing GFP, cells in growth medium were incubated with DAPI (at 10 μg/ml) at room temperature for 5 min and were washed once with growth medium before observation. The localization of Rsr1 in haploid yeast cells was determined using a chromosomal GFP-RSR1 fusion that complemented an rsr1 deletion (Supplemental Table II). Although GFP-Rsr1 appeared to be broadly distributed on the plasma membrane throughout the cell cycle in most cells, enrichment of GFP-Rsr1 at the sites of polarized growth was notable (Fig.1A, see also Fig.3B). GFP-Rsr1 appeared to be evenly distributed on the plasma membrane in over 50% of unbudded cells (n = 145, 1) and was enriched in a patch at the incipient bud site (20%; Fig. 1A, 2, 3, and8). After bud emergence, GFP-Rsr1 was enriched at the periphery of growing buds (89% of cells with small- and medium-sized buds, n = 70; Fig. 1A, 4 and5) and at the mother/bud neck at a later stage of cell cycle (55% of cells with large-sized buds, n = 100; Fig.1A, 6). Upon cytokinesis and cell separation, GFP-Rsr1 appeared to be more concentrated at a small portion of the plasma membrane, which corresponds to the division site, than in the rest of the plasma membrane (26% of G1 cells; Fig.1A, 7), and a new patch of GFP-Rsr1 appeared again before bud emergence (Fig. 1A, 8). Localization of GFP-Rsr1 in diploid a/α cells was very similar to that in haploid a or α cells (data not shown).Figure 3The CAAX motif and the polylysine repeat of Rsr1 are necessary for its proper localization. A, the hypervariable region of Rsr1 with the CAAX motif underlined. The residues mutated in rsr1C269S andrsr1K260–264S are indicated. B, localization of GFP-Rsr1C269S, GFP-Rsr1K260–264S, and GFP-Rsr1 wild type. Typically 10 Z-sections of cells expressing the GFP-Rsr1 (strain HPY401), GFP-Rsr1C269S (strain HPY590), or GFP-Rsr1K260–264S (strain HPY621) were examined by motorized stage movement of the microscope. A representative section is shown for each strain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also noticed intracellular distribution of GFP-Rsr1 in addition to localization to the plasma membrane and sites of polarized growth (see below). To confirm that the intracellular distribution was not background signal of a GFP fusion, we also expressed RSR1 as a YFP fusion protein from its own chromosomal locus, which also complemented an rsr1 deletion (Supplemental Table II). The localization pattern of YFP-Rsr1 was indistinguishable from that of GFP-Rsr1 (Fig. 1B), although overall signal was slightly weaker. Since Rsr1 can exist in GTP- and GDP-bound states, we wished to know whether Rsr1 localized differently depending on its guanine nucleotide-bound state. Thus we expressed the rsr1 mutants, which would be locked in a GTP- or GDP-bound state in vivo, and examined their localization as YFP fusion proteins. Each YFP-rsr1 mutant was expressed from the RSR1 chromosomal locus, and the level of the protein was approximately equal to the wild-type protein (data not shown). The apparent localization pattern of YFP-Rsr1K16N, which is predicted to be a GDP-bound or nucleotide-empty state in vivo (14Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was not significantly different from that of wild-type YFP-Rsr1, but some notable differences were found (Fig. 1B). Localization of YFP-Rsr1K16N to the polarized growth sites in cells with small- or medium-sized buds was diminished (30%, n = 70) compared with that of the wild-type cells (89%). The signal at the mother/bud neck appeared less tightly organized and often only at the mother or bud side (Fig. 1B, arrow). In contrast, YFP-Rsr1G12V, which is predicted to be a constitutively GTP-bound state (14Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), showed a more dramatic difference compared with the wild-type cells: the overall YFP signal on the plasma membrane and internal membranes was greatly enhanced uniformly. YFP-Rsr1G12V failed to be concentrated at the sites of polarized growth: less than 5% of unbudded cells (n = 100) showed enriched signals at the incipient bud site. Less than 10% of cells with small- or medium-sized buds (n = 70) and 20% of cells with large-sized buds (n = 120) showed polarized localization of YFP-Rsr1G12V (Fig.1B). Since both rsr1G12V andrsr1K16N mutations lead to random bud site selection (14Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), these results, together with data discussed below, suggest that localization of Rsr1 to the plasma membrane is necessary but not sufficient for its function. Its enrichment at the incipient bud site and polarized growth sites and continuous cycling of Rsr1-GTP and Rsr1-GDP are likely to be important for proper bud site selection. As shown above, GFP-Rsr1 localized to internal membranes in addition to the polarized growth sites and the plasma membrane. To determine whether GFP-Rsr1 localizes to any internal organelle specifically, cells expressing GFP-Rsr1 were stained with a dye that stains either DNA or the vacuole lumen. GFP-Rsr1 rarely localized to the boundary of nucleus stained with DAPI; rather it often appeared as a circular ring that did not overlap with the nucleus (Fig. 2). Next we stained cells with CellTracker Blue CMAC, a dye that stains the vacuole lumen. In most cells (>90%), the GFP-Rsr1 ring appeared right outside of the blue staining, indicating that GFP-Rsr1 localized to the vacuole surface (Fig. 2). It has been reported that overexpression of many membrane proteins that function elsewhere, such as the Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane, can cause accumulation of the protein within the vacuole (17Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, these proteins were mainly targeted to the lumen of vacuole rather than the surface. This phenomenon is most apparent in cells lacking the vacuole proteases that allow these proteins to accumulate without degradation (17Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 18Urbanowski J. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus we examined GFP-Rsr1 localization in apep4 mutant that lacked vacuole proteases to ensure that proteins localized to the lumen of the vacuole could be visualized. GFP-Rsr1 localized to the vacuole surface in pep4 mutant cells in a manner similar to its localization in PEP4cells (data not shown), indicating that GFP-Rsr1 does not localize within the interior of the vacuole. It has been reported recently that intracellular membranes and vesicular transport are involved in the passage of Ras proteins to the plasma membrane (19Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The signal required for Ras to be localized to the plasma membrane consists of two components: the C-terminal CAAX motif and either palmitoylation sites or a polybasic stretch of amino acids in the hypervariable region near the C terminus (19Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To confirm that the CAAX motif is necessary for membrane targeting of Rsr1, we expressedrsr1C269S (cysteine to serine change in the CAAX motif, Fig.3A) as a GFP fusion from theRSR1 locus on the chromosome. This mutation resulted in random bud site selection (Supplemental Table II) as expected. Collecting images of several Z-sections by motorized stage movement of the microscope, we confirmed that GFP-Rsr1C269S was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the intact CAAX motif is required for localization of Rsr1 to the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes. Rsr1 also contains five contiguous lysine residues (amino acids 260–264) in the hypervariable region (Fig. 3A), all of which we changed to serine. Expression of GFP-Rsr1K260–264S from the chromosome resulted in completely random budding unlike that seen with the wild-type Rsr1 fused to GFP (Supplemental Table II). Thus the lysine residues are essential for the function of Rsr1 in bud site selection. Interestingly, GFP-Rsr1K260–264S still localized to internal membranes, but it no longer localized to polarized growth sites and to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). BothGFP-rsr1C269S andGFP-rsr1K260–264S were expressed at about the same level as the wild type (data not shown), indicating that the difference in localization pattern of Rsr1 and its mutants was not due to a different level of each protein. Taken together, these data suggest that the CAAX motif and the lysine repeat in the hypervariable region of Rsr1 are required for localization to the plasma membrane and polarized growth sites, which is essential for proper bud site selection. We proposed previously that the Rsr1 GTPase cycle functions to guide proteins necessary for bud formation, such as Cdc24, to the proper bud site (8Park H.-O., Bi, E. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that Cdc24 localizes to the nucleus in early G1 cells through the association with Far1 and to an incipient bud site in late G1 phase (13Shimada Y. Gulli M.-P. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Toenjes K.A. Sawyer M.M. Johnson D.I. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1183-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how Cdc24 localizes to the incipient bud site in late G1 phase. We postulated that localization of Cdc24 to the proper bud site is dependent on Rsr1. Thus we examined the localization of Cdc24-GFP in the wild-type and rsr1Δ cells that were also stained with Calcofluor to visualize the previous division sites. As shown in Fig. 4A, Cdc24-GFP localized to a site adjacent to the previous division site in wild-type cells. In contrast, Cdc24-GFP localized to a random site inrsr1Δ cells, indicating that localization of Cdc24 to the proper bud site is dependent on Rsr1. It has been shown previously that Cdc24 specifically interacts with the GTP-bound Rsr1 in vitro (8Park H.-O., Bi, E. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 22Zheng Y. Bender A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 626-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus we also examined localization of Cdc24-GFP in cells carryingrsr1G12V or rsr1K16N on a multicopy plasmid. Localization of Cdc24-GFP in cells carrying YEp-rsr1K16N was not significantly different from that of cells carrying the vector control except that a patch of Cdc24-GFP signal in unbudded cells appeared at a random bud site (Fig.4B). In contrast, localization of Cdc24-GFP in cells carrying YEp-rsr1G12V was greatly altered compared with that of cells carrying the vector control (Fig. 4B): Cdc24-GFP was broadly distributed on the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes in unbudded cells (52%, n = 390) and sometimes in more than one patch. Cells with enriched signal of Cdc24-GFP at the periphery of growing buds also showed increased GFP signal on the plasma membrane and internal membranes (Fig.4B). Mislocalization of Cdc24-GFP was also observed in cells carrying the wild-type RSR1 on a multicopy plasmid but to a much less extent (data not shown). These results suggest that overexpression of a GTP-locked form of Rsr1 recruits Cdc24 uniformly to the plasma membrane. We showed previously that the regulators of Rsr1, Bud2 and Bud5, are localized to the presumptive bud site and to discrete sites during the cell cycle and that their localization is essential for selection of a specific site for growth (10Park H.-O. Sanson A. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1912-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Kang P.J. Sanson A. Lee B. Park H.-O. Science. 2001; 292: 1376-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Bud2 and Bud5 cannot maintain their localization at the proper bud site inrsr1Δ cells. Here we report that Rsr1 was also enriched at the incipient bud site and polarized growth sites. Expression of Rsr1G12V or Rsr1K16N, which causes a random bud site selection (14Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), resulted in much less polarized localization. In particular, Rsr1G12V, which is predicted to be a GTP-locked state in vivo (14Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), localized uniformly to the plasma membrane. Similarly, we found that localization of Rsr1 to the incipient bud site and polarized growth sites was diminished in abud2Δ mutant but to a lesser extent compared with that of Rsr1G12V (data not shown). Thus these studies indicate that localization of Rsr1 to the incipient bud site and polarized growth sites is important for proper bud site selection. Our findings support the view that selection of a proper site for growth requires the localized action of all components of the Rsr1 GTPase module. It has been reported previously by indirect immunofluorescence in a strain carrying RSR1 on a multicopy plasmid that Rsr1 localizes uniformly around the plasma membrane (23Michelitch M. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is likely that the previous study by Michelitch and Chant (23Michelitch M. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) missed enrichment of Rsr1 at the sites of polarized growth and on internal membranes due to overexpression of Rsr1 or fixation of yeast cells for immunofluorescence. We also show that localization of Cdc24 to the proper bud site in the G1 phase is dependent on Rsr1. In the absence of Rsr1, Cdc24 localized to a random location relative to the previous division site. This Cdc24 localization to a random site may occur through a distinct default pathway yet to be identified or by the stochastic accumulation of bud site assembly proteins on the plasma membrane. Moreover, we found that Cdc24 was mislocalized in cells overexpressing an rsr1 mutant that is predicted to be constitutively in the GTP-bound state in vivo. These data indicate that Cdc24 is targeted to the proper bud site through the interaction with Rsr1-GTP and that cycling of Rsr1 between GTP- and GDP-bound states is required for targeting of Cdc24 to the proper bud site, consistent with previous reports (8Park H.-O., Bi, E. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Ruggieri R. Bender A. Matsui Y. Powers S. Takai Y. Pringle J.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, these data further support the role of the Rsr1 GTPase cycle in guiding the bud site assembly proteins to the proper bud site (8Park H.-O., Bi, E. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells can still polarize their growth to form a bud, although in a random place, even when Cdc24 is mislocalized in cells carrying YEp-rsr1G12V. Uniform localization of Cdc24 to the plasma membrane due to overexpression of Rsr1G12V did not cause a multibudding phenotype, although rounder and larger cells were found (Fig. 4B). It is possible that the uniform localization of Cdc24 to the plasma membrane may not be sufficient to cause activation of Cdc42, whereas enrichment of Cdc24 in a patch can activate Cdc42. Alternatively, Cdc24 that is distributed uniformly around the plasma membrane in cells overexpressing Rsr1G12Vmay not be active because GTP-locked Rsr1 sequesters Cdc24 in an inactive state as proposed previously (8Park H.-O., Bi, E. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that Rsr1 also localized to the surface of vacuole. Localization to the vacuole does not necessarily indicate that Rsr1 functions at the vacuole and may result from a transient association of Rsr1 with intracellular membranes during its trafficking to the plasma membrane as seen with mammalian Ras proteins (19Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting to note that several recent reports suggest a link between the Cdc42 signaling pathway and vacuolar function and/or morphology (24White W.H. Johnson D.I. Genetics. 1997; 147: 43-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Murray J.M. Johnson D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3004-3009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Eitzen G.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5657-5665Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus the Rsr1 GTPase, which is likely to function upstream of Cdc42 (3Chant J. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 8Park H.-O., Bi, E. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), may also be involved in vacuolar function. We thank A. Simcox and E. Angerman for comments on the manuscript; A. F. Straight, T.

https://openalex.org/W2015318741,"We have studied the structural elements that affect ligand exchange between the two high affinity biotin-binding proteins, egg white avidin and its bacterial analogue, streptavidin. For this purpose, we have developed a simple assay based on the antipodal behavior of the two proteins toward hydrolysis of biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester (BNP). The assay provided the experimental basis for these studies. It was found that biotin migrates unidirectionally from streptavidin to avidin. Conversely, the biotin derivative, BNP, is transferred in the opposite direction, from avidin to streptavidin. A previous crystallographic study (Huberman, T., Eisenberg-Domovich, Y., Gitlin, G., Kulik, T., Bayer, E. A., Wilchek, M., and Livnah, O. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 32031–32039) provided insight into a plausible explanation for these results. These data revealed that the non-hydrolyzable BNP analogue, biotinylp-nitroanilide, was almost completely sheltered in streptavidin as opposed to avidin in which the disordered conformation of a critical loop resulted in the loss of several hydrogen bonds and concomitant exposure of the analogue to the solvent. In order to determine the minimal modification of the biotin molecule required to cause the disordered loop conformation, the structures of avidin and streptavidin were determined with norbiotin, homobiotin, and a common long-chain biotin derivative, biotinyl ε-aminocaproic acid. Six new crystal structures of the avidin and streptavidin complexes with the latter biotin analogues and derivatives were thus elucidated. It was found that extending the biotin side chain by a single CH2 group (i.e. homobiotin) is sufficient to result in this remarkable conformational change in the loop of avidin. These results bear significant biotechnological importance, suggesting that complexes containing biotinylated probes with streptavidin would be more stable than those with avidin. These findings should be heeded when developing new drugs based on lead compounds because it is difficult to predict the structural and conformational consequences on the resultant protein-ligand interactions.

These findings should be heeded when developing new drugs based on lead compounds because it is difficult to predict the structural and conformational consequences on the resultant protein-ligand interactions. biotinylp-nitrophenyl ester biotinyl p-nitrophenyl anilide biotinyl ε-aminocaproic acid 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene) benzoic acid The interaction of egg white avidin and bacterial streptavidin with biotin has evolved into an indispensable tool for general use in the biological sciences and as a model for the study of the interaction of a ligand with a protein (1Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Both avidin and streptavidin bind biotin with an essentially immeasurably high affinity constant (2Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). During the course of our studies on the avidin/streptavidin-biotin complex, we sought to examine whether biotin or its derivatives can be exchanged between the two proteins. Such a transfer can be of both practical and theoretical value. If practical application is desired, one can envision a situation where one of the proteins is first introduced into an experimental system followed by addition of the second biotin-binding protein. The question then arises whether one protein replaces the other or whether the effect will be cumulative. Such a situation may indeed occur upon in vivo application of the avidin-biotin system for localization and treatment of cancers (3Paganelli G. Pervez S. Siccardi A.G. Rowlinson G. Deleide G. Chiolerio F. Malcovati M. Scassellati G.A. Epenetos A.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 1184-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Paganelli G. Grana C. Chinol M. Cremonesi M., De Cicco C., De Braud F. Robertson C. Zurrida S. Casadio C. Zoboli S. Siccardi A.G. Veronesi U. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 1999; 26: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). From the theoretical point of view, it would be intriguing to determine whether a high affinity ligand added to one protein can be transferred to another (in this case, can biotin be transferred from avidin to streptavidin and vice versa). Moreover, if indeed such an exchange takes place, it is of interest whether the exchange is unidirectional or bidirectional and whether free biotin and its derivatives behave similarly. To address this problem, we exploited the previously reported difference in the behavior of avidin and streptavidin toward the hydrolysis of biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester (BNP).1 We have recently shown that egg white avidin hydrolyzes BNP at intermediate pH values to give biotin and p-nitrophenol, whereas streptavidin protects BNP against basic hydrolysis even under exceptionally high alkaline conditions (5Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32031-32039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The opposing properties of the two proteins allowed us to assess the exchange of BNP and biotin molecules between the two proteins, following defined periods of incubation. Consequently, in the current study we incubated avidin or streptavidin with biotin or BNP and examined whether the rival protein is capable of removing the ligand from the respective binding site. It was found that avidin can remove biotin from streptavidin but not BNP; conversely, streptavidin can remove BNP from avidin but not biotin. The reasons for this distinctive behavior of avidin and streptavidin were clarified by three-dimensional structure analysis of the two proteins. Because our previous structural data (5Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32031-32039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicated that the interaction of BNP with the two proteins is related to differential conformational change in the L3,4 loop, the structural consequences of the tight dimensions of the binding site and its relationship to the critical loop were probed by determining their structures with norbiotin and homobiotin. The latter biotin analogues represent a single methylene group subtraction and addition, respectively, in the valeric acid side chain of biotin. The structures of the resultant complexes were compared with those of biotin. This approach enabled us to determine the minimal structural requirement for loop distortion and concomitant promotion of ligand exchange. In addition, the structures of the two proteins were determined with a long-chain biotin derivative, biotinyl ε-aminocaproic acid, which is commonly used as a reagent for (strept)avidin-biotin technology. In this context, it was interesting to determine the status of the L3,4 loop in the respective protein upon binding the long-chain ligand. In previous work, more than 80 crystal structures for streptavidin and its complexes with various ligands have been determined (6Katz B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 776-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, only six structures have been reported for avidin (7Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite the numerous structures available, very little is known about the structural implications of the interactions of the two proteins with biotinyl analogues and derivatives modified at the carboxyl terminus of the ligand. In this work, we have determined six new structures of avidin and streptavidin complexes with two biotin analogues and a commonly used biotin derivative. The structures provide us with new insight into the interaction of these two proteins with the carboxylic acid side chain of the biotin molecule and the importance of the critical L3,4 loop of the protein. Subsaturating quantities of BNP (100 μl, 800 μm) were added to either avidin or streptavidin (1.78 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4. After 30 min, an equivalent amount of the rival protein in the same buffer was added. The competition interaction was allowed to proceed for desired time intervals, after which an equivolume of 1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10, was added. After 30 min, hydrolysis of BNP was determined by following the release of p-nitrophenol (ε410 = 17,500 cm−1 M−1). This approach effectively measured the relative amount of BNP available to avidin and protected by streptavidin. A modification of this approach was used to measure transfer of biotin. Biotin-blocked forms of avidin or streptavidin (1.78 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4, were prepared by incubating the protein in the presence of an excess of biotin, followed by overnight dialysis against the same buffer with several buffer changes. An equivalent amount of the rival protein in the same buffer was then added. Competition for the bound biotin was allowed to proceed for desired time intervals, after which BNP (125 μl, 800 μm) was added. After 30 min of incubation, an equivolume of 1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10, was added. After 20 min, BNP hydrolysis was assessed spectrophotometrically as described above. In this case, BNP was used as a postinteraction probe to measure the relative amount of the biotin derivative protected by streptavidin. Crystals of deglycosylated avidin (10Bayer E.A., De Meester F. Kulik T. Wilchek M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1995; 53: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were obtained via the vapor-diffusion hanging drop method at 20 °C in which a 3-μl drop contained 1.5 μl of deglycosylated avidin (4.2 mg/ml) and 1.5 μl of the reservoir solution containing 12% polyethylene glycol 1000 and 0.1 m imidazole malate buffer, pH 5.8. Crystals appeared after 4 days. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with two avidin monomers in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of avidin complexed with norbiotin, homobiotin, and biotinyl p-aminocaproic acid (Bcap) were obtained by soaking the crystals in a solution of the respective ligand for 10–20 days. Crystallographic data were collected at room temperature from a single crystal for each complex on a R-AXIS IV++ image plate mounted on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode generator with confocal MAXFLUXTM optics. The cell parameters for the avidin-norbiotin, -homobiotin and -Bcapcomplexes were in Å: a = 71.1, b = 79.8, c = 43.1; a = 71.8, b = 79.8, c = 42.9; and a = 71.0, b = 80.7, c = 43.1, respectively. Data were integrated, reduced, and scaled using the HKL suite (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Crystals of core streptavidin were obtained by the vapor-diffusion hanging drop method, using crystallization conditions previously reported (5Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T.

The 1-ml reservoir solution contained 1.2m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.2. Crystals appeared within 2 days and reached the final size after 4 more days. Complexes of core streptavidin with norbiotin, homobiotin, and Bcap were obtained by first soaking the crystals with the dye HABA (12Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 23c-24cCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) until the crystals became red (8Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The red crystals were then transferred to solutions containing the desired ligand. A slow decolorization was observed while the respective ligand displaced HABA from the binding site until the crystals became colorless. As reported previously (5Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y.

The cell parameters for the streptavidin-norbiotin, -homobiotin, and -Bcap complexes were in Å:a = 47.3, b = 95.3, c = 105.3; a = 47.3, b = 95.8, c = 105.6; and a = 47.5, b = 94.9, c = 105.5, respectively. Diffraction data for each complex were collected at room temperature. The streptavidin-norbiotin and -homobiotin complexes were collected on a RAXIS-IIc image plate mounted on an Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator with Charles Supper mirrors. Data for the streptavidin-Bcap complex were collected on a Rigaku RAXIS IV++ image plate mounted on a RU-H3R rotating anode generator with confocal MAXFLUXTM optics. Data were integrated, reduced, and scaled using the HKL suite (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the x-ray generators were operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. The distinctive properties of avidin and streptavidin with respect to hydrolysis of BNP were used to study the exchange of biotin or BNP between avidin and streptavidin. We assumed that upon prior incubation of BNP with avidin (under conditions where BNP alone is not hydrolyzed), followed by introduction of streptavidin, the amount of intrinsic hydrolyzable BNP would be reduced if ligand exchange took place, because the BNP molecules that were transferred from avidin to streptavidin would now be resistant to alkaline hydrolysis. On the other hand, if BNP were first incubated with streptavidin before the introduction of avidin, ligand exchange would result in an increase of BNP hydrolysis. Fig. 1 shows the influence of streptavidin on BNP-borne avidin and vice versa. The figure clearly demonstrates the transfer of BNP from avidin to streptavidin, as shown from the reduction in released p-nitrophenol. The effect was completed following 1 day of interaction. In contrast, no movement of BNP from streptavidin to avidin could be observed, even up to 9 days of incubation. Increase in the amount of avidin failed to change this behavior. A modification of the above approach is also appropriate for evaluating the exchange of biotin using extrinsically added BNP as a probe. If biotin is first incubated with avidin followed by the introduction of streptavidin, ligand exchange can be detected by the subsequent addition of known levels of BNP. Thus if biotin is transferred from avidin to streptavidin, some hydrolysis of BNP would be anticipated, according to the amount of biotin that vacated the binding site of avidin. On the other hand, if biotin is first incubated with streptavidin followed by introduction of avidin, ligand exchange would result in a reduction of hydrolysis of added BNP compared with that of control samples that lack the biotin-primed streptavidin. In order to examine the exchange of biotin between the two proteins, the desired protein was primed with the free vitamin followed by successive additions of the rival protein and BNP. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the biotin molecule formed a very stable complex with avidin and failed to undergo transfer to streptavidin. Consequently, no increase in releasedp-nitrophenol could be detected even after 10 days of incubation. On the other hand, a slow but consistent exchange of biotin from streptavidin to avidin was observed, which became more pronounced upon longer periods of incubation. A possible explanation for these unexpected findings may be evident from the distinctive three-dimensional structures of avidin and streptavidin with reference to the previously demonstrated differential binding of the BNP analogue, biotinyl p-nitroanilide (BNA) (5Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32031-32039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed in further detail the interaction of binding site residues and the critical L3,4 loop of the two proteins with a homologous series of biotin analogues and a commonly used biotin derivative. Because both avidin and streptavidin crystals belong to space groups already reported for the apo forms, molecular replacement methods were not required, and the solution was initiated at the stage of rigid body refinement. The initial goals were to place the avidin and streptavidin monomers in the correct position in the unit cell and to determine via electron density maps the presence of the ligands in the respective binding sites. The structures were initially refined using the rigid body protocol in the crystallography NMR system (CNS) (14Brünger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The initial electron density maps (Fo-Fc and 3Fo-2Fc), calculated after rigid body refinement, clearly indicated the presence of ligand molecules in the binding sites (Fig. 3). The structures were further refined using simulated annealing with slow cooling protocol in CNS (14Brünger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) (see Table I). For all refinement procedures, theFobs were scaled anisotropically, and bulk solvent correction was applied (15Jiang J.S. Brünger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The structures described were built into electron density maps using the graphics program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

The coordinates of the norbiotin, homobiotin, and Bcap complexes with avidin (1LDO, 1LDQ, and 1LEL, respectively) and streptavidin (1LCV,1LCW, and 1LCZ, respectively) are available at the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics protein data bank (17Berman H.M.

In all the avidin and streptavidin complexes, the overall folds of the monomers and their tetrameric arrangements are similar to those of the structures of the proteins in the apo- and ligand-complexed states described earlier (8Livnah O.

Each monomer of avidin and streptavidin is constructed of eight anti-parallel β-strands, which form a classic β-barrel with the binding site for biotin, its analogue, or derivative at the wide end of the barrel (Fig.4). The main structural difference between the avidin and streptavidin monomers lies in the size and conformation of the hairpin loops that connect the adjacent β-strands. The critical loop for the present study connects strands β3 to β4, denoted L3,4. Loop L3,4 in avidin is three residues larger than that of streptavidin and shows higher structural flexibility upon comparison of the available structures (6 avidin structures, 85 streptavidin structures) (8Livnah O.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The respective quaternary structure of avidin and streptavidin has been described as a dimer of dimers (21Kurzban G.P. Gitlin G. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8537-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The quaternary contact areas of avidin and streptavidin are very similar and consist of three intermonomeric interface regions. The interface previously defined as 1–2 (8Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) is crucial for the high affinity binding of biotin and other ligands. In this 1–2 interface, a tryptophan residue (Trp-110 in avidin and Trp-120 in streptavidin) is donated from one monomer to the biotin-binding site of its neighbor, thus contributing one of the aromatic residues which together form a tight hydrophobic cage (8Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). This conserved tryptophan contributes an essential component to the biotin-binding site of both proteins, and the conformation of this critical residue in both proteins is retained upon binding biotin. Site-directed mutagenesis of Trp-110 in avidin (22Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Trp-120 in streptavidin (23Chilkoti A. Tan P.H. Stayton P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) has indeed substantiated the significance of this particular residue to the high affinity exhibited by each protein toward biotin and the contribution of this binding site residue to the stability of the quaternary structure (24Freitag S., Le Trong I. Chilkoti A. Klumb L.A. Stayton P.S. Stenkamp R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Sano T. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The tertiary and quaternary arrangements of the avidin complexes with norbiotin, homobiotin, and Bcap are generally similar to each other and to the corresponding biotin complex. However, several noteworthy differences are evident. In the avidin-norbiotin complex, the set of H-bond interactions is almost identical to that of the avidin-biotin complex with respect to the bicyclic ring system (Fig.5, A and C). However, the lack of one methylene group in the aliphatic chain of norbiotin results in marked differences in the interactions of its carboxylate group with the L3,4 loop of avidin. In the avidin-biotin complex, one of the carboxylate oxygens of biotin exhibits three H-bonds with the L3,4 loop, whereas in the norbiotin complex only a single H-bond remains (with the Thr-38 Oγ). The second carboxylate oxygen of the avidin-biotin complex forms two H-bonds with Ser-73 Oγ and Ser-75 Oγ, compared with the lone H-bond with the main chain nitrogen of Ala-39 in the norbiotin complex. The potential H-bonding interactions of the second carboxylate oxygen in norbiotin with the two serine residues (73 and 75) is diminished, due to the spatial shift of the carboxylate toward the L3,4 loop (Fig. 5C). Despite the differences in the H-bond network of the L3,4 loop with the carboxylates of biotin and norbiotin, the loop retains a similar closed conformation in both cases, thus embracing the corresponding ligand in its binding site (Fig. 6).FIG. 6Comparison of the conformations of the L3,4 loop in the apo forms of avidin and streptavidin and in their respective ligand complexes. The left and right panels represent the avidin and streptavidin structures, respectively. The arrows represent the edges of the disordered L3,4 loop in the relevant structures. In the apo form of streptavidin, the L3,4 loop is disordered, whereas upon binding biotinyl analogues or derivatives the loop adopts the closed consensus conformation. The Bcap complex shown in the figure represents the ligand conformation as observed in monomer 1. In contrast to the streptavidin complexes, in the avidin complexes the structural stability of the L3,4 loop shows a higher susceptibility to the size and disposition of the biotinyl side chain. In the apo form, the loop is disordered, but upon binding to biotin or norbiotin the loop adopts a closed conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2026388693,"Bestrophin is a 68-kDa basolateral plasma membrane protein expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). It is encoded by the VMD2 gene, which is mutated in Best macular dystrophy, a disease characterized by a depressed light peak in the electrooculogram. Recently it was proposed that bestrophin is a chloride channel responsible for generating the light peak. To investigate its function further, we immunoaffinity purified a bestrophin complex from RPE lysates and identified bestrophin and the β-catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as members of the complex by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Protein-protein interaction between bestrophin and PP2Ac and the structural subunit of PP2A, PR65, was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of bestrophin was sufficient for the interaction with PP2A as demonstrated by a pulldown assay using a fusion of this domain with glutathione S-transferase. Bestrophin was phosphorylated when expressed in RPE-J cells and this phosphorylation was sensitive to okadaic acid. Purified PP2A effectively dephosphorylated bestrophinin vitro. These data suggest that bestrophin is in the signal transduction pathway that modulates the light peak of the electrooculogram, that it is regulated by phosphorylation, and that phosphorylation of bestrophin is in turn regulated by PP2A. Bestrophin is a 68-kDa basolateral plasma membrane protein expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). It is encoded by the VMD2 gene, which is mutated in Best macular dystrophy, a disease characterized by a depressed light peak in the electrooculogram. Recently it was proposed that bestrophin is a chloride channel responsible for generating the light peak. To investigate its function further, we immunoaffinity purified a bestrophin complex from RPE lysates and identified bestrophin and the β-catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as members of the complex by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Protein-protein interaction between bestrophin and PP2Ac and the structural subunit of PP2A, PR65, was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of bestrophin was sufficient for the interaction with PP2A as demonstrated by a pulldown assay using a fusion of this domain with glutathione S-transferase.

Clinically, BMD is characterized by an “egg yolk” or vitelliform lesion in the macula easily visible by fundus examination (1Cross H.E. Bard L. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1974; 77: 46-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Gass D.J.M. Gass D.J.M. Stereoscopic Atlas of Macular Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment. 1. Mosby, St. Louis1997: 303-313Google Scholar). It is thought that the vitelliform lesion may be caused by the abnormal deposition of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (3Weingeist T.A. Kobrin J.L. Watzke R.C. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1982; 100: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Histopathologically, BMD has been shown to manifest as a generalized RPE abnormality associated with lipofuscin accumulation, regions of geographic atrophy, and deposition of abnormal fibrillar material beneath the RPE (3Weingeist T.A. Kobrin J.L. Watzke R.C. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1982; 100: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4O'Gorman S. Flaherty W.A. Fishman G.A. Berson E.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1988; 106: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Occasional breaks in Bruch's membrane with accompanying neovascularization have also been reported (3Weingeist T.A. Kobrin J.L. Watzke R.C. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1982; 100: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4O'Gorman S. Flaherty W.A. Fishman G.A. Berson E.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1988; 106: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Many of these features are also found in age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Despite the histopathologic and clinical features described above, the defining characteristic of BMD is a light peak to dark trough ratio in the electrooculogram (EOG) less than 1.5, without aberrations in the clinical electroretinogram (1Cross H.E. Bard L. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1974; 77: 46-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Otherwise asymptomatic carriers of BMD-associated mutations will exhibit an altered EOG (5Maloney W.F. Robertson D.M. Duboff S.M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1977; 95: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6Bard L.A. Cross H.E. Trans. Am. Acad. Ophthalmol. Otolaryngol. 1975; 79: OP865-OP873Google Scholar). The EOG is a late response of the eye to light and is generated by a depolarization of the basal plasma membrane of the RPE (7Gallemore R.P. Hughes B.A. Miller S.S. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 175-198Google Scholar). This depolarization is thought to be caused by a Ca2+-sensitive chloride current (7Gallemore R.P. Hughes B.A. Miller S.S. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 175-198Google Scholar, 8Gallemore R.P. Steinberg R.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Gallemore R.P. Steinberg R.H. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of the light peak requires a “light peak substance” that is secreted by the neurosensory retina (7Gallemore R.P. Hughes B.A. Miller S.S. Marmor M.F. Wolfensberger T.J. The Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 175-198Google Scholar). Transduction of the signal that induces the light peak thus requires signaling across the RPE cell from a presumed receptor at the apical surface of the cells to activate one or more chloride channels in the basolateral plasma membrane of the RPE cell. The details of this pathway and indeed the identity of the light peak substance are unknown. The gene mutated in BMD, VMD2, was identified in 1998 (10Petrukhin K. Koisti M.J. Bakall B., Li, W. Xie G.

Bestrophin shares homology with the Caenorhabditis elegansRFP gene family, named for the presence of a conserved arginine (R), phenylalanine (F), proline (P), amino acid sequence motif. Our laboratory has produced antibodies that recognize bestrophin and demonstrated that bestrophin is a plasma membrane protein, localized to the basolateral surface of RPE cells (20Marmorstein A.D. Marmorstein L.Y. Rayborn M. Wang X. Hollyfield J.G. Petrukhin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12758-12763Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) consistent with a role for bestrophin in the generation or regulation of the EOG light peak. Recently, Sun et al. (21Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4008-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that bestrophin and other RFP family members represent a new class of chloride channels, indicating a direct role for bestrophin in generating the light peak. As a step toward understanding the function of bestrophin and how mutations in the protein result in retinal degenerative disease, we have immunoaffinity purified a bestrophin-containing complex from porcine RPE. Here, we demonstrate that bestrophin interacts physically with the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP2A. We also demonstrate that bestrophin is phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is sensitive to PP2A and okadaic acid (an inhibitor of PP2A). These data provide the first evidence for how bestrophin and potentially the light peak of the EOG are regulated. Mouse mAb (mAb) E6-6 and rabbit polyclonal antibody 125 recognizing human, porcine, and monkey bestrophin are described elsewhere (20Marmorstein A.D. Marmorstein L.Y. Rayborn M. Wang X. Hollyfield J.G. Petrukhin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12758-12763Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody E6-1 recognizing human, porcine, and monkey bestrophin was produced in the same fusion as E6-6 and exhibits properties identical to those of E6-6 (data not shown). Monoclonal antibody 1D6 recognizing the catalytic subunit of PP2A, mAb 2G9 recognizing an epitope common to all known PP2A B subunits, and a rabbit polyclonal IgG recognizing the A subunit of PP2A were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Western blots were performed as described previously (22Marmorstein L.Y. Ouchi T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and tetranitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. RPE cells were isolated from porcine eyes obtained from Hatfield Quality Meats (Hatfield, PA) as follows. Eyes were bisected posterior to the limbus and the neurosensory retina removed. RPE cells were gently brushed from the eyecup in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline using a camel's hair brush. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5–20 min at 4 °C. RPE pellets were stored frozen at –80 °C. For immunoaffinity purification, RPE cell pellets from 400 eyes were lysed for 3 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the insoluble cell debris discarded. Supernatants were precleared with 2.5 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B/100 ml for 2 h at 4 °C. To immunoaffinity isolate bestrophin-containing complexes, anti-bestrophin mAb E6-1 was cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B using dimethylpimelimidate (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 521-527Google Scholar) and was added to the precleared lysate. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B reacted with dimethylpimelimidate in the absence of antibody was used as a control. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet was washed three times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing either low salt (150 mm NaCl) or high salt (700 mm NaCl). The antibody-immobilized suspension was then transferred to a column. After washing with low salt wash buffer, the bestrophin-containing complexes were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and collected into tubes containing 1 m Tris, pH 9.5. Aliquots of samples were removed for direct analysis by Western blot. The remaining sample was concentrated using SDS-quinine sulfate precipitation as described previously (24McKinley M.P. Bolton D.C. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1983; 35: 57-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and after resuspension in SDS-PAGE sample buffer was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. The gel was stained with Gel Code Blue (Pierce), and bands were excised for protein identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Protein bands excised from the Gel Code Blue-stained gel were destained in 50% acetonitrile, dried in a Speed-Vac, and rehydrated in 15 μl of 30 mmN-ethylmorpholine acetate, pH 8.6, containing 0.1 μg of tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) and incubated overnight at 37 °C (25West K.

Tryptic digests were then extracted with 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (once with 60 μl, twice with 30 μl) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described previously using a PE Biosystems Voyager DE Pro instrument (25West K.

Measured protein masses were used to search the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, PIR, and NCBI sequence data bases for protein identifications and data base accession numbers. Bestrophin identifications were confirmed further by manual comparison against the predicted tryptic peptide map derived from the porcine bestrophin amino acid sequence presented in Fig. 2. The amino acid sequence was obtained by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry using the PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole electrospray instrument fitted with nanospray interface (MDS Proteomics A/S, Odense, Denmark) as described elsewhere (25West K.

A partial cDNA for porcine bestrophin was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA isolated from porcine RPE cells. The upstream primer 5′-CCAACCTGGGCAACGTGCTCATCCTGCGC-3′ was designed based on the human cDNA sequence encoding the conserved peptide YANLGNVLILR determined by mass spectrometry (see Table I) to be present in porcine bestrophin. The downstream primer 5′-GGCCGGTACCCTAGGAGTGTGCTTCATCCC-3′ was designed based on the porcine bestrophin sequence in an expressed sequence tag containing the C terminus of porcine bestrophin (GenBank accession no.

Open table in a new tab The GST-bestrophin fusion protein (GST-Best) contains amino acids 334–568 of human bestrophin. To create GST-Best, the corresponding region of human bestrophin cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library, subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector, and verified by sequencing. The fusion protein was expressed in BL21 bacterial cells and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (26Marmorstein L.Y. Kinev A.V. Chan G.K. Bochar D.A. Beniya H. Epstein J.A. Yen T.J. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2001; 104: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). GST-Best and GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (40 μl of 50% slurry containing 0.5 μg of GST-Best) were added to 1 ml of porcine retinal lysates (500 μg of total protein) that had been precleared with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The excess amount of GST (10 μg) was used as control for nonspecific sticking of PP2A. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted and washed three times in low salt wash buffer. The beads were then suspended in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and Western blot with PP2A antibody 1D6. RPE-J cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 32 °C in an environment of 95% air and 5% CO2 as described previously (27Nabi I.R. Mathews A.P. Cohen-Gould L. Gundersen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 37-49PubMed Google Scholar, 28Marmorstein A.D. Bonilha V.L. Chiflet S. Neill J.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3025-3034PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro phosphorylation assays, RPE-J cells were plated at confluence (3 × 105 cells/cm2) in six-well multiwell plates. After 24 h of growth at 32 °C, cells were switched to 39.5 °C and transduced with the replication-defective adenovirus AdBest, directing expression of human bestrophin at a multiplicity of infection of 60 as described previously (20Marmorstein A.D. Marmorstein L.Y. Rayborn M. Wang X. Hollyfield J.G. Petrukhin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12758-12763Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). 24 h after transduction, the cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES and labeled for 4 h with 800 μCi/ml32Pi containing 0 or 100 nm okadaic acid. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the plate in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem), 50 μl of washed PANSORBIN (Calbiochem), and 0 or 100 nm okadaic acid. After 1 h the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g. Bestrophin was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants with mAb E6-1. After SDS-PAGE, gels were dried and exposed for 30 min to a storage phosphorscreen. Phosphorimage analysis was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager and Imagequant version 5.1 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Purified PP2A isolated from human red blood cells as a heterodimer of the catalytic C and structural A subunits was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The activity of the purified enzyme was defined in units where 1 unit releases 1 nmol phosphate/min from 15 μm [32P]phosphorylase A at 30 °C. For the preparation of enzyme used, 1 unit was equal to ∼5 μg of protein. RPE-J cells were transduced with AdBest and labeled with32Pi as above. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed once with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MnCl2, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (reaction buffer). The beads were then resuspended in 195 μl of reaction buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and divided into three 65 μl aliquots. The following reagents were added to each tube in a 10 μl volume of reaction buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, bringing the volume of the reaction mixture to 75 μl. To one aliquot, no PP2A or okadaic acid was added. To a second aliquot 1 unit of purified PP2A containing both the catalytic C and structural A subunits (Upstate Biotechnology) was added. To the third aliquot 1 unit of purified PP2A and 100 nm okadaic acid were added. Aliquots were then digested for 30 min at 30 °C and the reaction terminated by the addition of 4× SDS-sample buffer. Samples were then boiled for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Films were scanned and band intensities determined using Imagequant 5.1 software. To identify proteins that interact with bestrophin we immunoaffinity purified a bestrophin-containing complex from lysates of isolated porcine RPE cells using mAb E6-1. As shown in Fig.1A immunoaffinity isolates are enriched for bestrophin, and the RPE lysate is effectively depleted of bestrophin. Gel Code Blue staining demonstrates a similar pattern of bands in column eluates from experiments in which the column was washed with either 150 mm NaCl (low salt; Fig.1B) or more stringent 700 mm NaCl (high salt; Fig. 1C). The major band at ∼68 kDa present in both high salt and low salt eluates was determined to be bestrophin by peptide mass mapping of tryptic peptides using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Five peptides matched bestrophin based on the human amino acid sequence, and three additional peptides matched based on the sequence encoded by a porcine bestrophin expressed sequence tag. Two of the peptides were confirmed to match regions of the predicted amino acid sequence of bestrophin by amino acid sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry (see Table I). To confirm further the identity of this band as authentic porcine bestrophin we obtained a partial cDNA encoding porcine bestrophin by reverse transcription-PCR from porcine RPE RNA. Primers based on the peptide sequences obtained by mass spectrometry were paired with primers based on the deduced sequence obtained from the porcine bestrophin expressed sequence tag for the PCR. The deduced amino acid sequence obtained from the PCR product is aligned with the deduced human (GenBank accession no. NM_004183) and mouse (assembled from the Celera data base, accession no. mCG1951) bestrophin amino acid sequences in Fig.2. As with the mouse, the porcine amino acid sequence diverges significantly toward the C-terminal domain of the protein. Of interest, the last 18 amino acids of the human sequence represent the peptide against which mAbs E6-1 and E6-6 were produced and are identical at 17 of 18 positions in the porcine sequence. In contrast, the mouse sequence in this region is poorly conserved explaining the species specificity of antibodies produced against this region of the protein. When the peptides identified by mass spectrometry were compared against the predicted tryptic peptide map of porcine bestrophin, 14 matches were made with the pig sequence, further confirming the identity of the ∼68 kDa band as porcine bestrophin (Table I). Two of the original peptides matching human bestrophin come from regions of the protein which were not covered by our partial porcine cDNA. 22 additional gel bands in the high and low salt eluates were detected by SDS-PAGE of the bestrophin protein complex. The majority of the bands were determined to be bestrophin fragments that probably arose from proteolysis during purification. One band at ∼ 36 kDa present in both high salt and low salt eluates was identified as the β-catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) by matching eight predicted tryptic peptides (Table II). To confirm the interaction between bestrophin and PP2Ac a series of experiments was performed in which either bestrophin or PP2Ac was immunoprecipitated from porcine or human RPE lysates (Fig. 3). When we immunoprecipitated with anti-bestrophin antibody, PP2Ac could be detected by Western blots of the bestrophin immunoprecipitate (Fig.3, left). When we precipitated with anti-PP2Ac, we could detect bestrophin in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3, right). These data confirm that bestrophin and PP2Ac interact.Table IIPeptides matching Sus scrofa protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit, β isotype associated with the ≈36 kDa gel bandPep"

Their importance for the efficiency of the translational process begins to be well documented. Here we have analyzed the in vivo effect of deleting genes coding for yeast tRNA-modifying enzymes, namely Pus1p, Pus3p, Pus4p, or Trm4p, on termination readthrough and +1 frameshift events. To this end, we have transformed each of the yeast deletion strains with a lacZ-luc dual-reporter vector harboring selected programmed recoding sites. We have found that only deletion of the PUS3 gene, encoding the enzyme that introduces pseudouridines at position 38 or 39 in tRNA, has an effect on the efficiency of the translation process. In this mutant, we have observed a reduced readthrough efficiency of each stop codon by natural nonsense suppressor tRNAs. This effect is solely due to the absence of pseudouridine 38 or 39 in tRNA because the inactive mutant protein Pus3[D151A]p did not restore the level of natural readthrough. Our results also show that absence of pseudouridine 39 in the slipperytRNAUAGLeu reduces +1 frameshift efficiency. Therefore, the presence of pseudouridine 38 or 39 in the tRNA anticodon arm enhances misreading of certain codons by natural nonsense tRNAs as well as promotes frameshifting on slippery sequences in yeast.

Among these molecules, tRNAs are generally the most modified and contain the largest number of different modified nucleotides (81 different structures reported to date, see Ref. 1Rozenski J. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although the function of most of these modified nucleotides remains unclear, the role of modified nucleotides in the anticodon loop of tRNA, especially at positions 34 and 37, begins to be well documented (reviewed in Ref. 2Björk G.R. Durand J.M. Hagervall T.G. Leipuviene R. Lundgren H.K. Nilsson K. Chen P. Qian Q. Urbonavicius J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and 3Curran J.F. Grosjean H. Benne R. The Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 493-516Google Scholar). These modifications usually improve the fidelity and efficiency of tRNA in decoding the genetic message in the correct frame on the ribosome. Pseudouridine (Ψ),1 an isomer of uridine, is by far the most frequently encountered modified nucleotide in tRNA. Indeed, Ψ is found almost universally at position 55 in the so-called TΨ loop and very often at position 13 in the D-arm and at positions 38 and 39 of the anticodon stem and loop of a large number of tRNA species from all organisms examined so far (Ref. 4Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholarand also see www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/biochemie/trna/). Depending on the species and the origin of the tRNA molecule, Ψ has been also found at several other positions (for review see Ref. 5Auffinger P. Westhof E. Grosjean H. Benne R. The Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 569-576Google Scholar). Pseudouridines in tRNA are formed post-transcriptionally by a family of enzymes called tRNA:Ψ-synthases (6Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1427-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, four tRNA:Ψ-synthases have been characterized so far: TruA, TruB, and TruC modify uridines at position 38–40 (8Kammen H.O. Marvel C.C. Hardy L. Penhoet E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2255-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 55 (9), and 65 (10), respectively. RluA catalyzes the formation of Ψ32 in tRNA and Ψ746 in 23 S rRNA (11Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (New York). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of truB orrluA has no discernible effect on exponential growth rate (as for the truC mutant) but confers a selective disadvantage in competition with wild-type cells. However, this phenotype for truB mutant is due to the absence of the protein TruB and not to the absence of Ψ55 per se (12Gutgsell N. Englund N. Niu L. Kaya Y. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). IntruA mutant cells, which are unable to modify the uridines at positions 38, 39, and 40, a decrease in the rate of the aminoacyl-tRNA selection step during translation depending on the identity of the tRNA has been demonstrated (13Li J. Esberg B. Curran J.F. Björk G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This observation could explain the pleiotropic phenotype of truA mutant cells, like derepression of his, leu, and ilvoperons, reduction of growth, and polypeptide chain elongation rates (reviewed in Ref. 3Curran J.F. Grosjean H. Benne R. The Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 493-516Google Scholar). It has not been established whether these phenotypes are linked to the lack of Ψ in anticodon arm of the tRNA or to the absence of the TruA protein per se. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, four tRNA:Ψ-synthases have been also characterized. Pus1p catalyzes the formation of Ψ at positions 26, 27, 28, 34, 35, 36, 65, and 67 in cytoplasmic tRNA (14Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (New York). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as well as position 44 in U2 small nuclear RNA (15Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Pus3p, Pus4p, and Pus6p act at positions 38, 39 (16), 55 (17), and 31 (18), respectively, in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (Fig. 1). None of these identified tRNA:Ψ-synthases in yeast is essential. However, disruption of PUS3 gene leads to a slower growth rate phenotype, especially at suboptimal temperatures (16Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Carbone M.L. Solinas M. Sora S. Panzeri L. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, combined disruptions of the PUS1 and LOS1 genes or the PUS1 and PUS4 genes cause lethality at increased temperatures (20Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Grosshans H. Lecointe F. Grosjean H. Hurt E. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46333-46339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Los1p has been characterized as the tRNA exportin in yeast and is required for the efficient nuclear export of spliced tRNAs (22Hellmuth K. Lau D.M. Bischoff F.R. Kunzler M. Hurt E. Simos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6374-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 23Grosshans H. Hurt E. Simos G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 830-840PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, nuclear export of the minor tRNAUAUIle and of a mutant tRNACUGGln, both substrates of Pus1p, is impaired in a disrupted pus1 strain. Thus Pus1p is directly implicated in the nuclear export of at least some tRNA species (21Grosshans H. Lecointe F. Grosjean H. Hurt E. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46333-46339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One role of Ψ is to stabilize the conformation of RNA by enhancing local base stacking (Ref. 24Davis D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5020-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 25Davis D.R. Grosjean H. Benne R. The Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 85-102Google Scholar) and by coordinating a structured water molecule between its N1-H and the phosphate backbone (Ref. 26Arnez J.G. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7560-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 27Auffinger P. Westhof E. Grosjean H. Benne R. The Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 103-112Google Scholar). Changes in tRNA structure, such as those induced by defective modification, may affect the decoding properties of tRNA. For example, lack of Ψ35 in yeast and plant tRNAGΨATyr (28Johnson P.F. Abelson J. Nature. 1983; 302: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Zerfass K. Beier H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5911-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Ψ38/39/40 in several E. coli tRNAs (Ref. 30Urbonavicius J. Qian Q. Durand J.M. Hagervall T.G. Björk G.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4863-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 31Charette M. Gray M.W. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) affect the misreading, readthrough, and/or +1 frameshift event(s). Less is known concerning the enzymatic formation of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in tRNA. In S. cerevisiae, one single gene product (Trm4p) catalyzes the formation of m5C at positions 34, 40, 48, and 49 in various cytoplasmic tRNAs (32Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). InE. coli, none of the tRNAs sequenced so far harbors this modified nucleotide (4Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The role of m5C in tRNA is largely ignored, except for the unique m5C40 in yeast tRNAGmAAPhe, which plays an important role in the correct spatial organization of the anticodon arm and the formation of a Mg2+-binding pocket (Ref. 33Chen Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Guenther R. Everett K. Agris P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10249-10253Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 34Agris P.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 79-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the unique m5C34 at the wobble position of the anticodon loop in yeast SUP53 tRNAm5CUALeu affects the efficiency of amber UAG codon suppression (35Strobel M.C. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2663-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have previously described a dual gene reporter that allows the analysis of the effect of cis- and trans-acting factors on translational recoding events, like readthrough and frameshifting (36Stahl G. Bidou L. Rousset J.P. Cassan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This in vivo system has now allowed us to test the role of specific modified nucleotides in tRNA, formed by Pus1p, Pus3p, Pus4p, and Trm4p, on the efficiency of stop codons readthrough and +1 frameshifting in yeast. We have found that the absence of pseudouridine at positions 38 or 39 causes a detectable defect on these recoding events. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study are W303 (MATa, ade2, his3-11, 15, leu2-3, trp1-1, ura3-1), FY73 (Mata, his-3Δ200, ura3-52), BY4742 (Mata, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0), 74-D694 [psi−] (Mata, ade 1-14, trp1-289, his3Δ200, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, [psi−]), 74-D694 [PSI+] (Mata, ade 1-14, trp1-289, his3Δ200, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, [PSI+]) and their respective derivative deleted mutants as indicated in Fig. 2 and Table II.

All mutant pus3Δ strains were from this study and are described below. These strains were grown in minimal media supplemented with the appropriate amino acids to allow maintenance of the different plasmids. Reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the recoding sequence in the unique MscI site present betweenlacZ and luc genes of pAC99 (37Namy O.

All constructs were verified by sequencing the region of interest with an ABI310 automatic sequencer. These plasmids were transformed into the different yeast strains described above (refer to figure and table legends) by the lithium acetate method (38Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed in the same crude extract as described previously (36Stahl G. Bidou L. Rousset J.P. Cassan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out using at least three independent transformants that were grown in the same conditions. Luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio obtained with test construct is normalized to the ratio obtained with the in-frame control (pAC-TQ for readthrough and pAC-TTy for frameshifting) and expresses readthrough or frameshift efficiency. Yeast mutant strains bearing a deletion of the PUS3 open reading frame were prepared by the one-step gene replacement approach (39Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). Thekanr gene was amplified from plasmid pF6A-kanMX2 by PCR using two oligonucleotides (CTCGAGGTGCCCACATGCAATCTTTACTGCCCTACTATAACCTCCCTTGACAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC and GAAAAGAAATATAGTCTTCAAGGTTATATTATACAGGTTTATATATTATTGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG) complementary to the kanMX2 cassette and to 50 nucleotides 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream to the PUS3 gene, respectively. The haploid yeast strains BY4742, 74-D694 [psi−] and 74-D694 [PSI+] were made competent by lithium acetate/PEG-4000 treatment and transformed by the purified PCR product. G418-resistant transformants were analyzed for correct integration by PCR amplification with specific oligonucleotides. The PUS3 gene and its 5′- and 3′-UTR was amplified by PCR from total yeast genomic DNA using primers CCCGAGATTATCCCATTCCAATGAC and ATGAAAAGAAATATAGTCTTCAAGG. The purified PCR product was cloned at the unique SmaI site of the pRS315 vector. In order to inactivate Pus3p, a mutation was introduced using an ExSiteTM PCR-based kit (Stratagene), to change an aspartate residue into an alanine (position 151 of the wild-type protein) with oligonucleotides gcagatgtggcagaacagccaagggagttagcgcc and ggcgctaactcccttggctgttctgccacatctgc, where c and g in small letters and bold indicate the point mutation. The sequence of these twoPUS3 genes was verified. The resulting plasmids were then transformed into the BY4742 pus3Δ strain. The gene of the yeast tRNACUGGln was amplified from plasmid pUN100-tQ using two complementary oligonucleotides, one bearing a T7 promoter sequence and the other the MvaI restriction site as described previously (21Grosshans H. Lecointe F. Grosjean H. Hurt E. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46333-46339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription of the substrate tRNACUGGln using [α-32P]CTP and the in vitro enzymatic assay for testing formation of modified nucleotides in tRNA transcript were described previously (40Jiang H.Q. Motorin Y. Jin Y.X. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The yeast S10 extracts were used at 0.2 mg/ml final concentration. The modified synthetic [α-32P]CTP-tRNACUGGlntranscript was phenol-extracted, precipitated, and redissolved in 50 mm NH4 acetate, pH 4.6, for further hydrolysis with 0.1 units of RNase T2 (Sigma). Each hydrolysate was chromatographed in two-dimensions on TLC plates (Schleicher & Schuell; 10 × 10 cm) using the chromatographic solvent system N/N as described previously (40Jiang H.Q. Motorin Y. Jin Y.X. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Radioactive spots were revealed and quantified after exposure of the plates to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant Pus3p was expressed in theE. coli BL21 (DE3) strain and purified from the inclusion bodies by extraction from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. 2F. Lecointe, unpublished results. Antibodies against Pus3p were prepared in rabbits by a standard immunization procedure after three injections of 0.25 mg of recombinant Pus3p per rabbit at 20-day intervals. S10 extracts from different strains (refer to legend of Fig. 3) were applied onto a 8% acrylamide gel and electrophoretically separated under denaturing conditions as described by Laemmli (69Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). Blotting was performed in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine buffer for 1 h at 80 V. For immunochemical detection the membrane was saturated by blocking agent (low fat milk) and incubated with the polyclonal antibodies against Pus3p. The membrane was then incubated with the anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase activity was revealed using substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma). Mature transfer tRNA contains a large variety of modified nucleotides. To test individually their importance for the accurate translation of the mRNA in S. cerevisiae, we checked two different processes as follows: codon-anticodon recognition by stop codon readthrough efficiency and processivity of the decoding process by the occurrence of frameshift events. Two model systems were used (Table I). The first one is based on the UAG readthrough of the TMV replicase cistron and allowed us to measure readthrough efficiency. This sequence contains a UAG termination codon embedded in a very peculiar nucleotide context and promotes a high level of spontaneous termination readthrough in yeast (36Stahl G. Bidou L. Rousset J.P. Cassan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41Namy O. Hatin I. Rousset J.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When the UAG stop codon is replaced by UAA or UGA, high readthrough efficiencies were also obtained (42Bidou L. Stahl G. Hatin I. Namy O. Rousset J.P. Farabaugh P.J. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 952-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The second system is based on the slippery sequence of the Ty1 retrotransposon, consisting of the heptanucleotide CUU AGG C, where AGG is a poorly recognized arginine codon. Slow decoding of this codon provides a translational pause that allows slippage of the tRNAUAGLeu from the leucine codon CUU to the leucine codon UUA. This results in incorporation of the major tRNAGCCGly in the A+1-site of the ribosome (43Belcourt M.F. Farabaugh P.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 339-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The sequences described above were inserted between thelacZ-luc dual reporter of pAC99 (37Namy O. Duchateau-Nguyen G. Rousset J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), wherelacZ is used as an internal reference for translation efficiency. With constructs pAC-TMV (UAG), pAC-TAA, and pAC-TGA (see Table I), ribosomes that terminate at the stop codon express only β-galactosidase, whereas those that read through the termination site also express luciferase. In pAC-Ty1, the luc gene is fused in the +1 frame downstream of the frameshift site making luciferase activity a measure of the efficiency of +1 frameshifting. These constructs were used to transform various yeast strains that were defective for the activity of a given tRNA modification enzyme, namely the pus1Δ, pus3Δ, pus4Δ, and trm4Δ strains. The enzymes Pus1p, Pus3p, Pus4p, and Trm4p catalyze the formation of different modified nucleotides in yeast tRNA (see Fig.1). Each transformed yeast strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids at 28 °C, and the ratios of luciferase/β-galactosidase activities were then determined. These results were normalized as described in Fig. 2 and compared with the ratios obtained with the corresponding wild-type strains. For each wild-type strain (indicated in black in Fig. 2), readthrough efficiencies of the three stop codons ranged between 13 and 25% for UAG, 8 and 11% for UGA and 5.5 and 7% for UAA, although the frameshift efficiencies ranged between 22 and 44%. These values are in good agreement with those obtained with other yeast strains (42Bidou L. Stahl G. Hatin I. Namy O. Rousset J.P. Farabaugh P.J. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 952-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as with another system depending on a lacZ reporter for Ty1 frameshifting (43Belcourt M.F. Farabaugh P.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 339-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The recorded efficiencies were not significantly different when wild-type strains are compared with their corresponding tRNA modification defective mutants (indicated inwhite in Fig. 2), except for the pus3Δ strain. Compared with the wild-type strain, the readthrough efficiency of thepus3Δ strain was reduced by a factor of 1.9, 2.2, or 1.4 on the stop codons UAG, UGA, and UAA, respectively. Moreover, thepus3Δ strain was the only mutant strain tested in this study that reduced the +1 frameshift efficiency on the Ty1 slippery site by a factor 1.8. Because readthrough efficiency was directly influenced by the competition between eRF1 and the suppressor tRNA in the A-site of the ribosome (44Drugeon G. Jean-Jean O. Frolova L., Le Goff X. Philippe M. Kisselev L. Haenni A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2254-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as well as by the presence of modified nucleotides in the anticodon arm (reviewed in Ref. 3Curran J.F. Grosjean H. Benne R. The Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 493-516Google Scholar), the effect observed with the pus3Δ strain suggested that the absence of pseudouridine in position 38 or 39 in yeast natural suppressor tRNA (no tRNA in yeast harbors Ψ at both position 38 and 39, see Ref. 4Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) caused a reduction in their ability to decode a stop codon. To verify that this effect was actually due to the absence of Ψ38 or Ψ39 and not to the absence of the Pus3p proteinper se, we introduced a point mutation that changed the aspartate residue in position 151 into alanine (pus3[D151A]). This aspartate residue is part of a characteristic motif among various RNA-pseudouridine synthases (6Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and in particular in E. coli TruA (aspartate residue 60) which catalyzes the formation of Ψ38/39/40 in bacterial tRNA. Its mutation into alanine has been shown to abolish the activity of the TruA enzyme (45Huang L. Pookanjanatavip M., Gu, X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We first verified that Pus3[D151A]p, when expressed in thepus3Δ strain, was unable to catalyze the formation of Ψ38 or Ψ39 in tRNA. S10 extracts prepared from the wild-type and pus3Δ strains as well as from the pus3Δ strain expressing the mutant Pus3[D151A]p protein were used to test pseudouridine formation in an in vitro transcribed and [α-32P]CTP-labeled yeast tRNACUGGln. This tRNA normally bears several modified nucleotides, among them are pseudouridines at positions 28, 38, and 55. These pseudouridines can be all formedin vitro and identified as a single radiolabeled spot on thin layer cellulose plates after two-dimensional chromatography of RNase T2 hydrolysates (21Grosshans H. Lecointe F. Grosjean H. Hurt E. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46333-46339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, panel A, the S10 extracts from the wild-type strain modified this tRNA giving rise to 2.1 mol of pseudouridine per mol of tRNA after 1 h of incubation. In contrast, the extract from the pus3Δ strain, which is unable to modify the uridines at positions 38 or 39 (16), produced only 1.3 mol of pseudouridine per mol of tRNA. Exactly the same result was obtained with the extract derived from the pus3Δ cells carrying the pus3[D151A] gene, confirming that the Pus3[D151A]p protein is catalytically inactive. This was not due to the instability of the mutant Pus3[D151A]p protein because it was expressed normally, as verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, panel B). The pus3Δ strain was transformed with a pRS315 centromeric plasmid harboring either the mutant pus3[D151A] or the wild-type PUS3 gene under its natural promoter, and the growth rates of the resulting strains were compared. By taking into account that the slow growth phenotype of the pus3Δ strain was particularly strong at suboptimal growth"

In contrast, relatively few studies have investigated how such histone fold dimers are further assembled and whether alternative higher order structures might be formed with different functions or properties. It has been shown that the interface between the two (H3+H4) histone dimers in an (H3+H4)2 tetramer is flexible and that alternative tetramer structures can result that wrap DNA in either a negative or positive DNA supercoil (9Hamiche A.

Mutagenesis and domain-swap experiments have revealed that this localization is similarly dependent on a difference at the histone dimer:dimer interface in (CENP−A+H4)2 and (CSE4p+H4)2versus(H3+H4)2 tetramers (12Shelby R.D.

Based on their crystal structures, nucleosomes assembled with histones from different species or histone variants do exhibit higher order structural differences, again most notably at the sites of histone dimer:dimer interactions (18Luger K.

Babu A.M. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). They are dimers in solution but must assemble into tetramers to bind DNA (23Grayling R.A. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 48: 437-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bailey K.A. Chow C.S. Reeve J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By mutagenesis, the residues have been identified (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that are directly responsible for DNA binding by HMfB, one of the two archaeal histones present in Methanothermus fervidus. By using a SELEX protocol, DNA molecules with intrinsically high affinity for HMfB have been isolated and characterized (26Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Widom J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, HMfA, the second archaeal histone inM. fervidus, does not bind with equally high affinity to these DNAs (27Bailey K.A. Marc F. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9293-9301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) even though HMfA and HMfB have 84% identical sequences, completely conserved DNA binding residues, and almost identical high resolution structures (22Decanniere K.

Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Domain-swap experiments showed that this difference in DNA affinity results from a difference in the C-terminal α3 (27Bailey K.A. Marc F. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9293-9301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This region of the histone fold was not previously thought to play any role in DNA binding but rather to be part of a 4HB that formed the interface between histone dimers when assembled into a tetramer. Such 4HBs, stabilized by both hydrophobic and ionic intermolecular interactions, form at the interfaces between the (H3+H4) histone dimers in the nucleosome and between the (dTAFII42+dTAFII62) histone fold dimers in Drosophila TFIID (Refs. 2Xie X.

Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6785) Google Scholar; see Fig.1A). Specifically, conserved salt bridges are formed between a histidine in α2 (His-113 in histone H3, His-66 in dTAFII42) and an aspartate in α3 (Asp-123 in histone H3, Asp-76 in dTAFII42). Structural homologs (His-49 and Asp-59) are present in the histone folds of both HMfA and HMfB and, in fact, in all ∼30 members of the HMfB family for which sequences are available (28Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As part of the earlier mutagenesis study (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), HMfB variants with D59A, D59E, and D59N substitutions were generated, but these failed to accumulate as soluble proteins when synthesized in Escherichia coli, consistent with Asp-59 also being required to interact with Arg-52 to form a native monomer histone fold (18Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6785) Google Scholar, 22Decanniere K. Babu A.M. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Soluble His-49 variants were obtained, and these bound DNA, but the complexes they formed had reduced electrophoretic mobilities when compared with the complexes formed by wild type HMfB (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Given the domain-swap evidence that α3 participates in determining DNA affinity (27Bailey K.A. Marc F. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9293-9301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the gel-shift indication that His-49 variants form less compact complexes (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we have constructed and report here the results of a detailed investigation of DNA binding and complex formation by a much wider spectrum of HMfB variants with residue substitutions introduced specifically at the histone fold sites predicted to participate in HMfB tetramer stabilization. Single and multiple substitutions have been made for His-49 and/or Leu-46 and Leu-62, the latter two residues being the HMfB structural homologs in α2 and α3, respectively, of Cys-110 and Leu-126 in H3 and Tyr-63 and Leu-79 in dTAFII42 (see Fig. 1A). These hydrophobic residues also interact to contribute stability to the 4HBs at the centers of (H3+H4)2 and (dTAFII42+dTAFII62)2 tetramers, respectively (2Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A.

Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6785) Google Scholar). The results obtained are consistent with residues at these locations in HMfB contributing to DNA affinity through tetramer stabilization. Unexpectedly, the results have also revealed that these residues determine whether the resulting HMfB tetramer has the ability to wrap DNA in either a negative or positive supercoil. By construction and mutagenesis of HMfA+HMfB and HMfB+HMfA histone heterodimer fusions, we have also demonstrated directly that it is the structure formed at the site of histone fold dimer:dimer interaction that establishes the difference in DNA affinity exhibited by HMfA versus HMfB tetramers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis, Construction of Archaeal Histone Fusions, and Purification of Recombinant Archaeal HistonesMutations were introduced into hmfB as previously described (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange™ procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (sequences available on request) purchased from Ransom Hill Biosciences (Ramona, CA). The presence of the desired mutation(s) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated gene was introduced into the pKK223–3-based expression system developed for recombinant HMfB synthesis (29Sandman K. Grayling R.A. Reeve J.N. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and E. coli JM105 was transformed with the expression plasmids. To construct in-frame gene fusions, the hmfA and hmfB genes were first separately amplified in PCR in which two of the primers had common sequences that encoded the amino acid sequence (TAPDRRG) that links two histone folds in a protein encoded in the Halobacterium NRC-1 genome (30Ng W.V. Kennedy S.P. Mahairas G.G. Berquist B. Pan M. Shukla H.D. Lasky S.R. Baliga N.S. Thorsson V. Sbrogna J. Swartzell S. Wei D. Hall J. Dahl T.A. Welti R. Goo Y.A. Leithauser B. Keller K. Cruz R.

These PCR products were mixed as the template, amplified, and joined in a PCR as described by Ho et al. (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar) to obtain hmfA-hmfA, hmfB-hmfB, hmfA-hmfB, and hmfB-hmfAgene fusions. The encoded HMfA-ATAPDRRG-HMfA, HMfB-TAPDRRG-HMfA, HMfB-TAPDRRGA-HMfB, and HMfA-ATAPDRRGA-HMfB histone fusions were subsequently designated HMfAA, HMfBA, HMfBB, and HMfAB, respectively. For correct folding, the lengths of the linkers had to be adjusted, as shown, to accommodate the unique presence of Met-1 in HMfA and Lys-69 in HMfB (see Fig. 1A). The QuikChange™ procedure was also used to introduce mutations into the hmfA-hmfB and hmfB-hmfA gene fusions to obtain histone fold fusions with an H49E substitution in either the HMfA or HMfB component. The gene fusions were cloned into the pKK223–3-based expression system and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Synthesis of the recombinant archaeal histones, archaeal histone variants, and archaeal histone fusions was induced by addition of 400 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to growing E. coli cultures. The proteins synthesized were purified, quantitated, and their CD spectra measured using an AVIV 62A-DA spectropolarimeter (AVIV, Lakewood, NJ) as previously described (32Li W-T. Grayling R.A. Sandman K. Edmondson S. Shriver J.W. Reeve J.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10563-11057Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The CD spectra obtained for HMfA, HMfB, the HMfB variants, and the histone fusions were almost identical (available on request), consistent with very similar folded native structures.Electrophoretic Mobility Gel-shift AssaysAgarose Gel-shift AssaysMixtures (15 μl) ofEcoRI-linearized pBR322 DNA (100 ng) and increasing amounts of an archaeal histone were incubated for 25 min at 25 °C in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl.

Messer W. Mol.

Based on the apparent differences in length, the length of DNA assembled per complex was calculated. The histone fold, three α-helices (α1, α2, and α3)1 separated by two β-strand loops (L1 and L2), was first identified in the four nucleosome core histones and shown to direct their assembly into (H2A+H2B) and (H3+H4) heterodimers (1Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Histone folds have since been found to direct the pairwise assembly of subunits in many transcription regulators, including TFIID, CBF, CHRAC, PCAF, SAGA, STAGA, and TFTC, and considerable effort has been focused on establishing the determinants of specific histone fold partnerships (2Xie X.

In contrast, relatively few studies have investigated how such histone fold dimers are further assembled and whether alternative higher order structures might be formed with different functions or properties. It has been shown that the interface between the two (H3+H4) histone dimers in an (H3+H4)2 tetramer is flexible and that alternative tetramer structures can result that wrap DNA in either a negative or positive DNA supercoil (9Hamiche A.

Mutagenesis and domain-swap experiments have revealed that this localization is similarly dependent on a difference at the histone dimer:dimer interface in (CENP−A+H4)2 and (CSE4p+H4)2versus(H3+H4)2 tetramers (12Shelby R.D.

Based on their crystal structures, nucleosomes assembled with histones from different species or histone variants do exhibit higher order structural differences, again most notably at the sites of histone dimer:dimer interactions (18Luger K.

Archaeal histones are only histone folds with structures almost identical to the histone folds in eukaryotic histones and transcription factors (22Decanniere K. Babu A.M. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). They are dimers in solution but must assemble into tetramers to bind DNA (23Grayling R.A. Sandman K. Reeve J.N.

By mutagenesis, the residues have been identified (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that are directly responsible for DNA binding by HMfB, one of the two archaeal histones present in Methanothermus fervidus. By using a SELEX protocol, DNA molecules with intrinsically high affinity for HMfB have been isolated and characterized (26Bailey K.A. Pereira S.L. Widom J. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, HMfA, the second archaeal histone inM. fervidus, does not bind with equally high affinity to these DNAs (27Bailey K.A. Marc F. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9293-9301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) even though HMfA and HMfB have 84% identical sequences, completely conserved DNA binding residues, and almost identical high resolution structures (22Decanniere K.

Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Domain-swap experiments showed that this difference in DNA affinity results from a difference in the C-terminal α3 (27Bailey K.A.

This region of the histone fold was not previously thought to play any role in DNA binding but rather to be part of a 4HB that formed the interface between histone dimers when assembled into a tetramer. Such 4HBs, stabilized by both hydrophobic and ionic intermolecular interactions, form at the interfaces between the (H3+H4) histone dimers in the nucleosome and between the (dTAFII42+dTAFII62) histone fold dimers in Drosophila TFIID (Refs. 2Xie X.

Specifically, conserved salt bridges are formed between a histidine in α2 (His-113 in histone H3, His-66 in dTAFII42) and an aspartate in α3 (Asp-123 in histone H3, Asp-76 in dTAFII42). Structural homologs (His-49 and Asp-59) are present in the histone folds of both HMfA and HMfB and, in fact, in all ∼30 members of the HMfB family for which sequences are available (28Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As part of the earlier mutagenesis study (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), HMfB variants with D59A, D59E, and D59N substitutions were generated, but these failed to accumulate as soluble proteins when synthesized in Escherichia coli, consistent with Asp-59 also being required to interact with Arg-52 to form a native monomer histone fold (18Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6785) Google Scholar, 22Decanniere K. Babu A.M. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Heinemann U. J. Mol.

Soluble His-49 variants were obtained, and these bound DNA, but the complexes they formed had reduced electrophoretic mobilities when compared with the complexes formed by wild type HMfB (25Soares D.J. Sandman K. Reeve J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Given the domain-swap evidence that α3 participates in determining DNA affinity (27Bailey K.A. Marc F.

PKD2 can be activated by phorbol esters both in vivo and in vitro but also by gastrin via the cholecystokinin/CCKB receptor in human gastric cancer cells stably transfected with the CCKB/gastrin receptor (AGS-B cells). Here we identify the mechanisms of gastrin-induced PKD2 activation in AGS-B cells. PKD2 phosphorylation in response to gastrin was rapid, reaching a maximum after 10 min of incubation. Our data demonstrate that gastrin-stimulated PKD2 activation involves a heterotrimeric Gαq protein as well as the activation of phospholipase C. Furthermore, we show that PKD2 can be activated by classical and novel members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family such as PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη. These PKCs are activated by gastrin in AGS-B cells. Thus, PKD2 is likely to be a novel downstream target of specific PKCs upon the stimulation of AGS-B cells with gastrin. Our data suggest a two-step mechanism of activation of PKD2 via endogenously produced diacylglycerol and the activation of PKCs.

This kinase exhibits a high homology to PKD/PKCμ and PKCν but not to the classical, novel, and atypical members of the protein kinase C family. PKD2 has two cysteine-rich domains at its N terminus that bind phorbol esters and diacylglycerol and is potently activated by phorbol estersin vitro and in vivo. In addition, gastrin activates PKD2 via the CCKB/gastrin receptor (also termed the CCK2 receptor). However, the precise mechanism leading to the activation of PKD2 in response to gastrin has not been characterized. Gastrin is implicated in a wide range of fundamental biological responses such as secretion, growth, and neoplastic transformation (2Rozengurt E. Walsh J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is considerable interest in the elucidation of signaling pathways mediated by the CCKB/gastrin receptor in nontransformed and transformed cells. Gastrin, CCK, and CCK-related peptides exert their effects by binding to specific G protein-coupled receptor subtypes. The CCKB/gastrin receptor binds gastrin and CCK with similar affinity, whereas the CCKA (also called CCK1) receptor exhibits a 500-fold higher affinity for CCK than for gastrin (3Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G607-G613PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding to the CCKB/gastrin receptor, gastrin stimulates multiple signaling pathways. One of the earliest signal transduction pathways activated in response to gastrin is the stimulation of β-isoforms of PLC, leading to IP3-mediated Ca2+-mobilization from internal stores and DAG-induced stimulation of classical and novel isoforms of the protein kinase C family. In this manuscript we identify the precise signaling mechanism leading to activation of PKD2 in response to gastrin. We show that the activation of PKD2 by gastrin in AGS-B cells involves a Gαq heterotrimeric G protein, PLC, and possibly various PKC isoforms, making PKD2 a novel downstream target of members of the PKC family.

For detection of PKD2 phosphorylated at Ser706and Ser710, the PKD/PKCμ Ser(P)744/Ser(P)748 antibody was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (1:1000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for the anti-FLAG antibody) or anti-rabbit IgG (for the anti-PKD2 or Ser(P)876 antibodies) and subsequent enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitations, HEK293 or AGS-B cells in 35-mm dishes transfected with various plasmids as described in the Figs. 2, 4, and 5 legends were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer I). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with the PKD2 antiserum (1:100 dilution), the Ser(P)876 PKD2 antiserum (1:200), or the monoclonal FLAG antibody precoupled to agarose (Sigma) or polyclonal antibodies directed against PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη as described in the FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5 legends. The immune complexes were recovered using protein A-Sepharose where appropriate. For the immunoprecipitations of endogenous PKD2 we used 1 mg of protein per condition.

PKD was then eluted at 4 °C for 30 min by batchwise incubation of the immunoprecipitates with 0.5 mg/ml immunizing peptide in lysis buffer II (elution buffer; 4 volumes of elution buffer to 1 volume of protein A-agarose). For experiments investigating the effect of GF I on the in vitro kinase activity of PKD2, the kinase was eluted from the immunocomplexes as described above. 20 μl of the eluate were mixed with 20 μl of phosphorylation mix containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 400–600 cpm/pmol), 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 nm PDBu and 100 μg/ml PS. The mixture was subsequently incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal amount of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) and were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To examine PKD2 autokinase activity, histone phosphorylation by PKD2, and the autokinase activity of the various PKC isoforms, the respective kinase was not eluted. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer I, twice with lysis buffer II, and twice with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer in the presence (for histone phosphorylation) or absence (for autokinase activity) of 0.5 mg/ml histone H1 and 100 μm [γ32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, terminated by adding an equal amount of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were further analyzed by scanning densitometry using the MacBAS V2.5 software (Fuji Photo Film, 1996). We have demonstrated that the activation of PKD2 can be efficiently monitored by examining serine phosphorylation at position 876 in PKD2 (1Sturany S. Van Lint J. Mueller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hoecker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of gastrin-induced PKD2 activation, AGS-B cells were incubated with 100 nm gastrin for various times and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the Ser(P)876 antibody. As shown in Fig.1A, gastrin induced a rapid phosphorylation of PKD2 at Ser876 detectable as early as 2.5 min after the addition of gastrin to the cells and still detectable after 60 min of stimulation. The increase in Ser876phosphorylation was paralleled by an increase in histone phosphorylation in PKD2 kinase assays. A maximum 8-fold increase in histone phosphorylation was detected after 10 min of incubation (Fig.1B). Gastrin also phosphorylated PKD2 in human CX-1 colorectal cancer cells that endogenously express the CCKB/gastrin receptor. The activation of PKD2 by gastrin in these cells was comparable with the level of activation obtained in response to PDBu (Fig. 1A, right panel). The CCKBreceptor can couple to various heterotrimeric G proteins such as Gαq/11, Gαi3, and Gαo (8Paulssen R.H. Fraeyman N. Florholmen J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The coupling of a G protein-coupled receptor to specific heterotrimeric G proteins can be examined by the expression of minigene plasmid constructs that encode oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the C-terminal undecapeptide of distinct α subunits (7Gilchrist A. Bunemann M., Li, A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transfection of the vectors leads to an inability of a receptor to couple to that G protein via a competitive inhibition mechanism. To directly assess which G protein subunit was involved in the gastrin-induced activation of PKD2, AGS-B cells were transfected with various minigenes to block the activation of specific endogenous Gα subunits prior to incubation of the cells with gastrin for 10 min. Activation of PKD2 was further analyzed using the Ser(P)876antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A(upper panel), only the minigene targeting Gαq reduced gastrin-induced activation of PKD2. Thus, PKD2 activation in response to gastrin involves the activation of a Gαq heterotrimeric G protein. Gαq regulates the activation of various PKC isoforms including PKCα (9Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To compare the role of Gαq as an upstream regulator of PKD2 and PKC activation, AGS-B cells were transfected with the Gαq minigene construct, and the activation of PKCα was subsequently analyzed using an activation-specific antibody that selectively detects active PKCα phosphorylated at Ser657 (10Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2B (upper panel), the minigene targeting Gαq prevented gastrin-induced phosphorylation of PKCα at Ser657. Thus, Gαq is an upstream regulator of both PKCα and PKD2. One of the earliest events in the signal transduction pathways mediated by the CCKB receptor after the activation of a heterotrimeric G protein is the activation of the β-isoform of PLC producing two second messengers, IP3 and DAG. IP3 binds to its intracellular receptor and triggers the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. DAG, the other second messenger, activates members of the PKC family but also members of the PKD family (12Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because the same heterotrimeric G protein can regulate the activation of PKCs and PKD2, we wanted to examine whether gastrin-induced activation of PKD2 in AGS-B cells also requires phospholipase C activation. AGS-B cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the selective phospholipase C inhibitor ET18OCH3 (13Powis G. Seewald M.J. Gratas C. Melder D. Riebow J. Modest E.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2835-2840PubMed Google Scholar) prior to stimulation with gastrin. As shown in Fig. 3A(upper panel), the PLC inhibitor blocked PKD2 phosphorylation at Ser876 in a concentration-dependent manner. Half-maximum and maximal inhibition of PKD2 activation were achieved at 6.4 and 20 μm ET18OCH3, respectively. Recently, Ser744 and Ser748 were identified asin vivo transphosphorylation sites within the activation loop of PKD using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes activated PKD dually phosphorylated at Ser744 and Ser748(14Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence used to generate this antibody is identical in PKD and PKD2, with the corresponding serine residues being Ser706 and Ser710 in PKD2. Because AGS-B cells express very little PKD/PKCμ as compared with PKD2, 2S. Sturany and T. Seufferlein, unpublished observations. we wanted to examine whether gastrin could stimulate phosphorylation of Ser706/Ser710 in PKD2 using this antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A (lower panel), only a single band of phosphorylated proteins running at 105 kDa (the molecular mass of PKD2) was detectable in lysates of AGS-B cells stimulated with gastrin. In parallel experiments, the antibody also detected FLAG-tagged PKD2 transfected into HEK293 cells after stimulation with PDBu (data not shown and Fig.5B). Gastrin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKD2 on Ser706/Ser710 was also prevented by the incubation of the cells with the PLC inhibitor at concentrations comparable with those required to inhibit PKD2 autokinase activity and Ser876 phosphorylation of PKD2. Accordingly, ET18OCH3 inhibited PKD2 autokinase activity at similar concentrations (Fig. 3B, upper panel). At the concentrations used, ET18OCH3 did not affect the expression of PKD2 protein and had no effect on the viability of AGS-B cells (Fig. 3B, lower panel, and data not shown). DAG is endogenously produced after the stimulation of cells with gastrin and activates members of the PKC family. Interestingly, the search of a novel data base (website: scansite.mit.edu; Ref. 15Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) for sequence motifs within PKD2 likely to be phosphorylated by specific protein kinases revealed putative phosphorylation sites in PKD2 for PKCδ (Ser200) and PKCε (Thr417). Thus, PKD2 could be a downstream target of PKCs. To determine whether PKCs could be involved in the activation of PKD2 in response to gastrin, AGS-B cells were treated with various concentrations of the PKC inhibitors GF I and Ro 318220 prior to stimulation of the cells with gastrin. As shown in Fig.4A, PKD2 autokinase activity and histone phosphorylation in response to gastrin were inhibited in a concentration dependent manner by both inhibitors. Half-maximum and maximum inhibition of PKD2 autokinase activity as well as histone phosphorylation were achieved at 0.8 and 5 μm Ro 318220 and 2 and 5 μm GF I, respectively. 5 μm GF I inhibited PKD2 kinase activity by about 70%, whereas in cells treated with 5 μm Ro 318220, PKD2 kinase activity was virtually abolished. GF I and Ro 318220 also inhibited gastrin-induced phosphorylation of PKD2 at Ser876 at similar concentrations. Both inhibitors, however, can inhibit other protein kinases in addition to PKCs (16Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar) and could therefore directly inhibit PKD2. To determine the effect of both inhibitors on the kinase activity of PKD2 stimulatedin vitro, HEK293 cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged PKD2 expression plasmid, and the immunoprecipitated kinase was activated in vitro with PS and PDBu in the presence or absence of Ro 318220 or GF I. As shown in Fig. 4C, both GF I and Ro 318220 indeed inhibited the autokinase activity of PKD2 by about 75 and 70%, respectively. Interestingly, histone phosphorylation by PS/PDBu-activated PKD2 was virtually abolished by the treatment of cells with the same concentration of GF I or Ro 318220. Thus, using these inhibitors we could not differentiate between activation of PKC and PKD2. We therefore wanted to assess directly whether PKC isoforms could activate PKD2. cDNAs corresponding to PKD2 and constitutively activated PKC isoforms were transiently coexpressed in HEK293 cells, and PKD2 kinase activity was determined in the cell lysates 48 h after transfection. Our results demonstrate that PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη potently activate PKD2 autokinase activity (Fig.5A). Similarly, these PKC isoforms also stimulated phosphorylation of Ser876 and Ser706/Ser710 in PKD2 (Fig. 5B). The activation of PKD2 by PKCη and PKCε was comparable with the effect of a maximum efficient concentration of PDBu. PKCα-induced PKD2 autokinase activity was only ∼65% of the effect of PDBu. The level of phosphorylation of Ser876 and Ser706/Ser710 was comparable upon stimulation of cells with PDBu. However, in cells transfected with PKCε or PKCη the phosphorylation of Ser876 was markedly more pronounced than the phosphorylation of Ser706/Ser710. The activation of PKD2 by the PKC isoforms was specific. Constitutively activated PKCδ did not stimulate PKD2 autokinase activity and had no effect on the phosphorylation of Ser876 and Ser706/Ser710 in PKD2 (Fig. 5B). This demonstrates that specific conventional and novel PKCs are potential upstream activators of PKD2. To clarify whether PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη could be mediators of gastrin-stimulated PKD2 activation, it was important to determine whether gastrin activates these PKCs in AGS-B cells. Therefore, we examined the kinase activity of these PKCs in response to gastrin. As shown in Fig. 5C, gastrin could activate PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη in AGS-B cells. Activation of these PKCs by gastrin was comparable with the effect of a maximum efficient concentration of PDBu. Thus, these PKC isoforms could mediate gastrin-induced PKD2 activation, establishing a novel signaling cascade elicited by the CCKB/gastrin receptor (Fig.6). Interestingly, gastrin also activated PKDδ in AGS-B cells. The effect of gastrin on PKCδ activation was also comparable with that of PDBu (Fig. 5C, lower panel). This shows that gastrin can activate multiple PKC isoforms in AGS-B cells, but only specific isoforms of the PKC family mediate gastrin-induced activation of PKD2. Gastrin induces multiple intracellular signaling pathways (17Seufferlein T. Withers D. Broad S. Herget T. Walsh J.H. Rozengurt E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 383-393PubMed Google Scholar) that mediate various biological functions including growth and neoplastic transformation (2Rozengurt E. Walsh J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Indeed, gastrin has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancers that produce gastrin-related peptides and express CCKB receptors (18Thorburn C.M. Friedman G.D. Dickinson C.J. Vogelman J.H. Orentreich N. Parsonnet J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Hartwich A. Konturek S.J. Pierzchalski P.

Therefore, there is considerable interest in the elucidation of signaling pathways mediated by the CCKB/gastrin receptor in tumor cells. Recently, we cloned a novel serine/threonine kinase termed PKD2 because of the high homology of this kinase with PKD/PKCμ. In the present manuscript we have identified signaling pathways mediating PKD2 activation in response to the binding of gastrin to the CCKB receptor in human gastric cancer cells. Using AGS-B cells, a human gastric cancer cell line stably transfected with the CCKB/gastrin receptor (4Hoecker M. Henihan R.J. Rosewicz S. Riecken E.-O. Zhang Z. Koh T.J. Wang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27015-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that gastrin rapidly activates PKD2 by a Gαq- and phospholipase C-dependent signaling pathway. Our data show that endogenously expressed CCKB receptors also mediate the activation of PKD2, e.g. in CX-1 colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, in addition to Ser876, we have identified Ser706 and Ser710 as in vivophosphorylation sites in PKD2 in response to gastrin. These residues correspond to Ser744 and Ser748 in PKD. The sequence within the activation loop surrounding Ser706 and Ser710 in PKD2 (IIGEKpSFRRpSVVGT) is identical to the corresponding sequence in PKD. In PKD the phosphorylation of Ser744 and Ser748 is mediated through a PKC-dependent pathway (14Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, a search for sequence motifs within PKD2 likely to be phosphorylated by specific protein kinases in a novel data base (cansite.mit.edu; Ref. 15Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) revealed putative phosphorylation sites for PKCδ and PKCε. Treatment of intact cells with two different PKC inhibitors, GF I and Ro 318220, prevented gastrin-induced PKD2 autokinase activity, histone phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of PKD2 at Ser876and Ser706/Ser710. However, both inhibitors also prevented PKD2 activation in vitro by PS/PDBu. This is in marked contrast to PKD; PS/PDBu-stimulated PKD activity is not affected by these inhibitors (21Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the high 98% sequence homology of the kinase domains of PKD2 and PKD (1Sturany S. Van Lint J. Mueller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hoecker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), there seems to be a functional difference in the catalytic domains with regard to their sensitivity toward inhibitors. In addition, there also seems to be a difference in the substrate specificity of PKD2 and PKD; histone is only poorly phosphorylated by PKD/PKCμ (23Gschwendt M. Johannes F.J. Kittstein W. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20742-20746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but very efficiently phosphorylated by PKD2 (1Sturany S. Van Lint J. Mueller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hoecker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). At present, we are trying to clarify this point by three-dimensional structural analysis of the catalytic domains of PKD and PKD2, respectively. Despite the fact that PKC inhibitors were not suitable to differentiate between PKC and PKD2 kinase activity, we provide direct evidence that PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη are potential upstream activators of PKD2; in particular, the activation of PKD2 in response to PKCε and PKCη was comparable with the activation by PDBu. Interestingly, PKCα, like PDBu, induced a similar level of phosphorylation of PKD2 at Ser876 and Ser706/Ser710, respectively. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Ser876 in response to PKCε or PKCη was more pronounced than the phosphorylation of Ser706/Ser710. This suggests that the phosphorylation of Ser706/Ser710 in PKD2 reflects the activation of the kinase, but the degree of Ser706/Ser710 phosphorylation does not necessarily correspond to the level of PKD2 activation. The effect of PKCs on PKD2 activation is specific. Constitutively activated PKCδ failed to stimulate PKD2 autokinase activity. This does not exclude the fact that PKD2 could be phosphorylated by PKCδ as suggested by the scansite results without affecting PKD2 kinase activity. Whereas PKCε and PKCη are also activating PKD/PKCμ (21Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22Zugaza J.L. Waldron R.T. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23952-23960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), PKCα has not been shown to induce PKD/PKCμ activation, suggesting that there could be differences in the upstream regulators of PKD2 and PKD/PKCμ. Finally, our data demonstrate that gastrin activates PKCα, PKCε, and PKCη in AGS-B cells. Interestingly, we could detect an increase in phosphorylation/activation of PKCs after treatment of AGS-B cells with gastrin or PDBu not only by using activation-specific antibodies but also in immune complex kinase assays. This finding contrasts somewhat with studies (24Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) indicating that some PKCs exist already in the fully phosphorylated state in resting cells. This discrepancy could be partly explained by the fact that in our serum-starved AGS-B cells we find a rather low basal level of PKC phosphorylation, which can be markedly increased upon the incubation of cells with gastrin or PDBu. Indeed, similar results have been demonstrated for PKCδ in serum-starved HEK 293 cells (25Good J.L. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that the phosphorylation of some PKCs such as PKCε is primarily regulated rather than constitutive (26Cenni V. Döppler H. Sonnenburg E.D. Maraldi N. Newton A.C. Toker A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that both gastrin and PDBu also activated PKCδ in the AGS-B cells as demonstrated in immune complex kinase assays or by using an activation-specific antibody that selectively detects PKCδ phosphorylated at Thr505. This suggests that only certain isoforms of the PKC family mediate gastrin-induced activation of PKD2. In conclusion, we envisage a novel signaling cascade downstream of the CCKB receptor involving Gαq and phospholipase C and PKCα, PKCε, or PKCη, leading to the activation of the novel serine/threonine kinase PKD2.

https://openalex.org/W2056915139,"<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> are relevant models for studying the roles of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) during the development of multicellular organisms. The genome projects of these organisms have revealed the existence of multiple genes related to GAG-synthesizing enzymes. Although the putative genes encoding the enzymes that synthesize the GAG-protein linkage region have also been identified, there is no direct evidence that the GAG chains bind covalently to core proteins. This study aimed to clarify whether GAG chains in these organisms are linked to core proteins through the conventional linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence found in vertebrates and whether modifications by phosphorylation and sulfation reported for vertebrates are present also in invertebrates. The linkage region oligosaccharides were isolated from <i>C. elegans</i> chondroitin in addition to <i>D. melanogaster</i>heparan and chondroitin sulfate after digestion with the respective bacterial eliminases and were then derivatized with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide. Their structures were characterized by gel filtration and anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with enzymatic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry, which demonstrated a uniform linkage tetrasaccharide structure of -GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl- or -GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl(2-<i>O</i>-phosphate)- for <i>C. elegans</i> chondroitin and <i>D. melanogaster</i> CS, respectively. In contrast, the unmodified and phosphorylated counterparts were demonstrated in heparan sulfate of adult flies at a molar ratio of 73:27, and in that of the immortalized<i>D. melanogaster</i> S2 cell line at a molar ratio of 7:93, which suggests that the linkage region in the fruit fly first becomes phosphorylated uniformly on the Xyl residue and then dephosphorylated. It has been established here that GAG chains in both<i>C. elegans</i> and <i>D. melanogaster</i> are synthesized on the core protein through the ubiquitous linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence, suggesting that indispensable functions of the linkage region in the GAG synthesis have been well conserved during evolution."

Remarkably, the epithelial polarized layer was stable under these asymmetric culture conditions for at least 24 h, and the presence of Caco-2 cells was necessary to maintain H. pylori growth. In contrast to previous studies conducted with non-polarized Caco-2 cells and other cell lines kept under aerophilic conditions, we found H. pylori-dependent stimulation of cytokine secretion (MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractantprotein-1), GRO-α (growth-regulated oncogene-α), RANTES (regulated on activationnormal T cell expressed andsecreted)). This correlated with nuclear translocation of NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits. Tyrosine phosphorylation of nine cellular proteins was induced or enhanced; we identified p120RasGAP, p190RhoGAP, p62dok (downstream of tyrosinekinases), and cortactin as H. pylori-inducible targets. Moreover, reduction of H. pylori urease expression was observed in adherent bacteria as compared with bacteria in suspension. In addition to mimicking several observations seen in the inflamed gastric mucosa, the novel in vitro system was allowed to underscore complex cellular events not seen in classicalin vitro analyses of microaerophilic bacteria-epithelial cell cross-talk. Molecular dissection of the mechanisms underlyingHelicobacter pylori infection suffers from the lack of in vitro systems mimicking in vivoobservations. A system was developed whereby human epithelial cells (Caco-2) grown as polarized monolayers and bacteria can communicate with each other under culture conditions optimal for each partner. Caco-2 cells grown on filter supports were inserted in a vertical position into diffusion chambers equilibrated with air and 5% CO2 at their basolateral surface (aerophilic conditions) and 5% CO2, 5% O2, 90% N2(microaerophilic conditions) in the apical compartment.

Eckmann L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The function of these cells in host defense goes far beyond the mere mechanical barrier separating the external environment from the internal milieu of the host. Epithelial cells have to be considered as an integral component of the mucosal immune system, as they are capable of providing the underlying mucosa with the message that an infection occurs (2Campbell N. Yio X.Y., So, L.P., Li, Y. Mayer L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by the release of molecular messengers including cytokines and chemokines by the epithelial cells that orchestrate initial phases of the immune response. Given the molecular complexity of these events, their dissection requires the availability of in vitro systems, which mimics the in vivo situation. To fulfill this requirement, viability of all cell partners has to be guaranteed, and biologic read-outs should resemble those establishedin vivo. Although in vivo studies have contributed to important breakthroughs regarding the morphological and physiological events resulting from the infection by Helicobacter pylori, the major causative agent of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoreticular tissue lymphoma (3Parsonnet J.

So far, the design of such a robust in vitro system has not been reported for the study of H. pylori-epithelial cell interactions. Two major difficulties have to be overcome: 1) gastric cell lines cannot be grown as polarized epithelia mimicking the gastric mucosa (5Smoot D.T. Resau J.H. Naab T. Desbordes B.C. Gilliam T.

Commun. 2000; 271: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) do not stand the microaerophilic conditions needed for the particular metabolism of H. pylori. The low oxygen conditions prevailing in the gastric environment are important in the activation of H. pylori virulence genes (10Cussac V. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2466-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, urease is required for initial gastric colonization (11McGee D.J. Mobley H.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 241: 155-180PubMed Google Scholar), allowing the bacterium to maintain its periplasmic pH near neutrality (12Sachs G. Meyer-Rosberg K. Scott D.R. Melchers K. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1996; 69: 301-316PubMed Google Scholar, 13Scott D.R. Weeks D. Hong C. Postius S. Melchers K. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 58-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The expression of H. pylori CagA protein, strongly associated with duodenal ulceration, is influenced through the culture medium pHin vitro (14Karita M. Tummuru M.K. Wirth H.P. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4501-4507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These examples indicate that neglecting crucial bacterial growth parameters could preclude the refined study ofH. pylori-epithelial cell interactions. Moreover, all studies have been performed under aerophilic conditions whereas a restricted oxygen atmosphere is required for proper H. pylori metabolic and growth functions (15Elder J.B. Hearn A.R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1980; 65: 19-27PubMed Google Scholar). For these important reasons, we designed a novel in vitrosystem maintaining optimal culture conditions for H. pyloriadded to polarized epithelial cells serving as an interface between the apical and basolateral compartments of diffusion chambers. Bacteria in BHI,1 pH 5.5, 5 mm urea, 5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2 kept dividing up only in the presence of the polarized Caco-2 monolayer. Bacterium-cell contact resulted in pedestal formation and brush border disruption as observed in vivo. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including p120RasGAP, p190RhoGAP, p62dok, and cortactin was observed for the first time. In addition to NF-κB nuclear translocation and IL-8 secretion, MCP-1, GRO-α, and RANTES induction detected in biopsies could be reproduced under microaerophilic conditions only. In comparison with H. pylori floating in suspension, bacteria associated with Caco-2 cells exhibited decreased urease A and B subunits expression. Thein vitro model developed in this study will represent a valuable mimic of host-pathogen interaction to examine complex molecular aspects of H. pylori infection, such as the bacterial virulence program, the mechanism of adherence and the contribution of epithelial cell to bacterial colonization, and the cross-talk with inflammatory cells. Human colonic adenocarcinoma epithelial Caco-2 cells (HTB 37; American Type Tissue Collection) were grown in C-DMEM consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed), 1% non essential amino acids (Seromed), 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 0.1% transferrin (Invitrogen), and 1% streptomycin/penicillin (Seromed) and used between passages 23 and 37. Cells cultivated to 80% confluency were seeded on Snapwell filters (diameter, 12 mm; pore size, 0.4 μm; Corning Costar) at a density of 0.8 × 105 cells/cm2. The formation of a polarized Caco-2 cell monolayer at week 3 was established by morphology and monitoring of the TER (200–400 ohm × cm2) using a Millicell-ERS apparatus (Millipore). The H. pylori CagA+ strain ATCC 43504 was grown on agar plates made of 36 g/liter GC-agar base (Oxoid AG) containing 12.5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen) and 1% IsoVitale X (Baltimore Biological Laboratories) in a microaerophilic atmosphere (90% N2, 5% CO2, 5% O2) for 2 days before harvest into either plain BHI (BioMeárieux) or into BHI supplemented with 0.25% yeast extract (BHI-C; Difco Laboratories) and 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed). The total number of bacteria was determined by measuring the A600 of the bacterial suspension, 1.0 optical density unit corresponding to 108 bacteria. The diffusion chamber device developed by Grass and Sweetana (16Grass G.M. Sweetana S.A. Pharm. Res. 1988; 5: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was modified to maintain both H. pylori and the polarized Caco-2 cells under optimal growth conditions. Caco-2 cells were seeded onto Snapwell filter (Costar) and allowed to form a tight, polarized monolayer (17Stubbe H. Berdoz J. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Cortheásy B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The filters carrying the cell monolayers were inserted between the two chambers, thus resulting in the physical separation into apical and basolateral compartments containing different culture media (Fig. 1). Up to six devices could be mounted serially on a support. Caco-2 cells were fed through the basolateral compartments containing C-DMEM perfused with air and 5% CO2. The apical compartments containing BHI-C, BHI, or BHI-U (BHI medium containing 5 mm urea, pH 5.5) were perfused continuously under microaerophilic gas conditions (90% N2, 5% CO2, 5% O2) necessary for the optimal proliferation of H. pylori. The gas mixture flow rate was set at 50 ml/min, and the inlet pressure was fixed to 1.1 bar to give a steady delivery of the gas mixtures to each compartment. Constant administration of the gas mixtures into the airtight device for up to 24 h resulted in dissolved pO2and pCO2 ranging around (mm of Hg measured in a Chiron Diagnostic blood gas analyzer) 110 and 34 in the apical BHI and 140 and 35 in basolateral C-DMEM, respectively. Oxygen-binding proteins in culture medium accounts for the 110 mm of Hg observed under microaerophilic conditions (18Taylor W.G. Camalier R.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 111: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); we confirmed this assumption by measuring similar dissolved pO2 in BHI kept in sealed flasks (Oxoid AG) equilibrated with 90% N2, 5% CO2, 5% O2. The integrity of the epithelial Caco-2 cells as a function of the experimental conditions was reflected by the measurement of the TER, which was expressed as the percentage of the TER obtained at the beginning of the incubation period. In experiments dealing with exposure of Caco-2 cells to H. pylori, the bacterial inoculum was added to the apical compartments at a concentration ranging between 5 × 105 and 9 × 106bacteria per ml. Snapwell support carrying Caco-2 polarized monolayers were removed, transferred into 6-well dishes, and washed five times with 0.9% NaCl. The Caco-2 cells were then detached by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C in the presence of trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) added to the apical (0.5 ml) and the basolateral (1.5 ml) surfaces. The adherent bacteria were dispersed by vigorous pipetting, serial dilutions (10−2 to 10−4) were applied onto triplicate agar plates left for 4–5 days at 37 °C under microaerophilic conditions (90% N2, 5% CO2, 5% O2), and c.f.u. were determined. Suspension H. pylori recovered directly from the apical medium were assessed using serial dilutions ranging from 10−3 to 10−6. For the experiment reported in Fig. 7, the equivalent of 5 × 105H. pylori (counted as above) recovered from either the supernatant or attached to Caco-2 cells were lysed in 15% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration). The whole lysate was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and resolved by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Polarized Caco-2 cells were washed five times with 0.9% NaCl, fixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, post-fixed for 1 h with 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812 (Polysciences Inc.). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined using a Philips CM 10 transmission electron microscope. Caco-2 cells on Snapwell filters were lysed by adding a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and rocking on ice for 30 min. Cells were then scraped into 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Soluble lysates were incubated with mAb 4G10 to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (5 μg for 100 μl of lysate; Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added for an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C, and the antibody·antigen complexes were washed with TENT (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Following SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), immunodetection of proteins was performed with rabbit antiserum against human p120RasGAP (1:250; Transduction Laboratories), mAb against human p190RhoGAP (1:500; Transduction Laboratories), mAb against human p62dok (1:250; Transduction Laboratories), and mAb against human cortactin (1:1,000; Transduction Laboratories). Immunoblotting of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins recovered from whole Caco-2 cell extracts was performed with biotinylated mAb 4G10 (1:4,000; Upstate Biotechnology). Urease inH. pylori lysates was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit antiserum against urease apoenzyme (1:1,000). 2B. Cortheásy, unpublished observations.Antigen·antibody complexes were detected with secondary antibodies or Extravidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Sigma) and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Chemokines released by polarized Caco-2 cells in the basolateral cell culture medium were measured using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for human IL-8, MCP-1, GRO-α, and RANTES (Quantikine, R & D Systems) and expressed as picograms of specific protein per milliliter of culture medium. Data are duplicates of two-three independent experiments. Caco-2 cells from three Snapwell filters were recovered by trypsinization and incubated for 15 min in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cells were lysed in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant corresponding to the cytoplasmic extracts was frozen immediately. The nuclei were resuspended in 270 μl of a high salt buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). DNA-binding proteins were extracted by the addition of 30 μl of 3 m(NH4)2SO4 and gentle shaking for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was spun in a Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor for 15 min at 200,000 × g. The supernatant was concentrated by 22% (NH4)2SO4precipitation and spun in a Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor for 10 min at 100,000 × g. The protein pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of high salt buffer and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min using 5 μg of nuclear proteins and 0.5 ng (25,000 counts per min) of [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled oligonucleotide in 15 μl of binding buffer containing (in mm) 10 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 NaCl, 50 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 5 dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.75 μg poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sequences of the consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide used for EMSA were: coding strand, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAG-3′; non-coding strand, 5′-GCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAA-3′. DNA·protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: B32Google Scholar) and visualized via autoradiography. In competition experiments, increasing molar excess (0.045 m Tris-borate, 1 mm EDTA) of the unlabeled consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide was used and compared with mutated NF-κB oligonucleotide consisting of the following: coding strand, 5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAG-3′; non-coding strand, 5′-GCCTGGGAAAGTCGCCTCAA-3′. To confirm that members of the NF-κB family extracted from Caco-2 cells were contributing to the retardation of the DNA probe, rabbit Ab (1 μg/reaction) against the NF-κB subunits p50 or p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to EMSA mixtures during the binding reaction period. Increased oxygen tension (21Catrenich C.E. Makin K.M. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1991; 181: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), alkaline or neutral pH (22Cellini L. Allocati N., Di Campli E. Dainelli B. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 38: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and prolonged incubation (23Reynolds D.J. Penn C.W. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2649-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) prompt formation of coccoid forms of H. pylori no longer able to adhere and signal like spiral forms (24Cole S.P. Cirillo D. Kagnoff M.F. Guiney D.G. Eckmann L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 843-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus sought to establish conditions optimal for H. pylori growth and not deleterious to epithelial Caco-2 cells grown as polarized monolayers. A microaerophilic gas mixture (5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2) was applied to the apical compartment, whereas the basolateral surface of cells was exposed to air and 5% CO2. TER (a measure of the integrity of the Caco-2 cell polarized monolayer) resulting from polarized Caco-2 cells was stable either when BHI replaced C-DMEM or when the microaerophilic conditions were applied to the apical compartment (Fig.2A). In microaerophilic apical BHI, a multiplicity of infection of 10, respectively, 100 did not affect TER for up to 48 h (Fig. 2B). TER was preserved down to pH 5.0 (a pH value resembling that reported in the stomach antrum) when aerophilic or microaerophilic BHI was present in the apical compartment. 3S. Cottet, unpublished observations. We found no drop in TER value when 5 mm urea, a substrate favoring H. pylori viability at low pH, was added (Fig.2C). This defined that culture conditions ensuring optimal growth and adhesion (see below) of H. pylori, namely plain BHI, pH 5.5, 5 mm urea, and a microaerophilic gas mixture, are well tolerated by polarized Caco-2 monolayers. The definition of optimal culture conditions for H. pylori in the apical compartment is summarized in TableI. Under aerophilic conditions, bacterial counts (c.f.u.) in the medium dropped rapidly within 4 h in C-DMEM (column 1); in BHI-U, the drop in bacterial counts showed a lag phase, eventually resulting in poor survival at 24 h (column 2). In contrast, we found that continued growth ofH. pylori over a 24-h period was observed in microaerophilic BHI-U (column 3). Determination of the number of live bacteria in the apical compartment at different times revealed that growth resumed between 8 and 12 h. Remarkably, the effect was dependent on the presence of polarized Caco-2 cells at the interface between the apical and basolateral compartment (compare columns 3 and 4). The data demonstrate that maintenance of liveH. pylori under non-physiological conditions depends on parameters, of which ignorance is likely to seriously affect its growth, and thus adhesion and resulting signaling properties (see below).Table IDetermination of the number of H. pylori in various media bathing the apical compartment.Apical medium1234C-DMEMBHI-UBHI-UBHI-UCaco-2+++−GasAAMMTimehc.f.u.08.68.68.6 ± 3.08.6 ± 3.040.00051.43.6 ± 1.23.5 ± 1.6802.35.2 ± 1.63.5 ± 1.812NDND8.9 ± 2.61.5 ± 0.0912400.6537 ± 5.40.54 ± 0.16c.f.u.

(× 106) were obtained after incubation in aerophilic (A) or in microaerophilic (M) gas conditions for the indicated times. Results are means ± S.D. of two–three independent experiments (n = 3 filters/experiment). Because the microaerophilic gas conditions led to a much better bacterial growth capacity in the apical compartment, we then examined, using c.f.u. counting, whether this consistently improved adhesion ofH. pylori to Caco-2 cells. At 4 h, >20 times more adhesive bacteria were recovered when microaerophilic BHI and BHI-C media were used as compared with aerophilic conditions (Fig.3A). In BHI-U, this factor raised up to 100-fold in favor of the microaerophilic environment (Fig.3A). Under microaerophilic conditions at 24 h, the capacity of H. pylori to adhere to Caco-2 cells was similar in all three media examined, whereas c.f.u. counts remained very low under aerophilic conditions (Fig. 3A). Adhesion is therefore linked closely with the preserved ability ofH. pylori to multiply (Table I, column 3).H. pylori laid down over Caco-2 or AGS cells grown as non-polarized monolayers on plastic in C-DMEM yielded c.f.u. counts as low as in aerophilic BHI media. 4S. Cottet, unpublished observations. We observed the average binding of seven bacteria per Caco-2 cell (5 × 106H. pylori per filter carrying 7 × 105 Caco-2), and found that 10-fold differences in the initial bacterial load did not modify this ratio, thus arguing for specific association (Fig. 3B). Together, this indicates that optimized culture conditions for H. pylori and Caco-2 cells avoid possible nonspecific effects including epithelial cell apoptosis resulting from the addition of dead bacteria, bacterial debris (25Moss S.F. Calam J. Agarwal B. Wang S. Holt P.R. Gut. 1996; 38: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 26Fan X. Gunasena H. Cheng Z. Espejo R. Crowe S.E. Ernst P.B. Reyes V.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1918-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), or excessive amounts of bacteria. Caco-2 cells simply grown on plastic miss both brush border and tight junctions (27Grasset E. Pinto M. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Desjeux J.-F. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: C260-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Caco-2 cells seeded on Snapwell filters exhibit such features, with expression of brush border sucrose isomaltase and basolateral polymeric Ig receptor (28Chantret I. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brattain M.G. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1936-1942PubMed Google Scholar). Given that Caco-2 cells maintained high TER values, and H. pylorishowed much improved viability (see Figs. 2 and 3), we thus examined by electron microscopy what Caco-2 and H. pylori looked like in the novel system described herein. Similar to gastric biopsies, the association between Caco-2 epithelial cells and H. pyloritriggers morphological changes including brush border effacement and pedestal formation (Fig. 4, Aand B). The pictures obtained after 24 h of incubation showed the expected rod shape of H. pylori, as well as the presence of non-aggregated bacteria sitting at the Caco-2 surface (Fig.4A). Under these conditions, no coccoid H. pyloricould be observed at 24 h, yet this has been observed upon exposure to non-polarized epithelial cells maintained under aerophilic conditions (8Segal E.D. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Actin rearrangement within the host cell occurred directly beneath the site of attachment of H. pylori, forming a very fine condensed structure concentric to the bacterium (Fig. 4B). No such alterations were seen in the absence ofH. pylori or under aerophilic conditions not ensuring bacterial viability (Table I). In contrast to previous data showing no pedestal formation and actin filament rearrangement using non-gastric cells (29Dytoc M. Gold B. Louie M. Huesca M. Fedorko L. Crowe S. Lingwood C. Brunton J. Sherman P. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 448-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the system as established satisfies this requirement, thus suggesting optimized cross-talk between H. pylori and Caco-2 cells. Epithelial cells grown on plastic and exposed to H. pylori for 1–6 h have been shown to trigger NF-κB activation (30Mu¨nzenmaier A. Lange C. Glocker E. Covacci A. Moran A. Bereswill S. Baeuerle P.A. Kist M. Pahl H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6140-6147PubMed Google Scholar, 31Keates S. Hitti Y.S. Upton M. Kelly C.P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1099-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Using polarized Caco-2 cells, and thanks to the potential of the culture system to preserve H. pyloriviability (Table I), this enabled us to extend the analysis to 24 h. We first compared the translocation properties of NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits induced by H. pylori in aerophilic and microaerophilic BHI-U (Fig.5A). The latter gave rise to a much more pronounced nuclear accumulation of both subunits (p50, 5.5-fold; p65, 3-fold). Nuclear translocation was strictly dependent on the incubation of Caco-2 cells with H. pylori and was sustained for up to 24 h. The level of p65 kept increasing between 2 and 24 h, whereas that of p50 reached steady-state after 2 h. Consistent with this, the higher amount of translocated p50 and p65 resulted in the formation of more DNA·NF-κB complexes in EMSA (Fig.5B, compare lanes 1 and 2 withlanes 5 and 6). Antisera to either subunit abolished (lanes 3 and 4) or reduced (lanes 7 and 8) the formation of the DNA·NF-κB complex, indicating that the p50-p65 heterodimer represents the DNA binding form of NF-κB activated after exposure to H. pylori. Competition experiments confirmed the specificity of binding to the consensus NF-κB DNA probe (lanes 9–12). Under identical EMSA conditions, barely detectable DNA·NF-κB complexes were obtained with nuclear extracts from AGS cells grown on plastic 5B. Cortheásy, unpublished observations.; in agreement with Table I, dead or coccoid bacteria can trigger NF-κB activation only to low levels. Although H. pylori triggers protein phosphorylation in AGS cells (8Segal E.D. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), only scarce information exists as to the nature of these activities. We thus examined the pattern of phosphorylation of Caco-2 cytoplasmic proteins after incubation with H. pylori (Fig.5C). In microaerophilic BHI-U, we found that ten protein bands were tyrosine-phosphorylated de novo, with apparent molecular weights (Mr) ranging from 47,000 to 184,000. Under aerophilic conditions, only doublets at 136 kDa yielded a signal. 6S. Cottet, unpublished observations. The pattern was the same at 4 and 24 h, indicating that the interaction between the epithelial cells and the bacterium led to prolonged stimulation of pathways supposed t"
https://openalex.org/W2045597126,"BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) proteins are molecular chaperone regulators that affect diverse cellular pathways. All members share a conserved motif, called the BAG domain (BD), which binds to Hsp70/Hsc70 family proteins and modulates their activity. We have determined the solution structure of BD from BAG4/SODD (silencer of death domains) by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods and compared it to the corresponding domain in BAG1 (Briknarová, K., Takayama, S., Brive, L., Havert, M. L., Knee, D. A., Velasco, J., Homma, S., Cabezas, E., Stuart, J., Hoyt, D. W., Satterthwait, A. C., Llinás, M., Reed, J. C., and Ely, K. R. (2001) Nat. Struct. Biol.8, 349–352). The difference between BDs from these two BAG proteins is striking, and the structural comparison defines two subfamilies of mammalian BD-containing proteins. One subfamily includes the closely related BAG3, BAG4, and BAG5 proteins, and the other is represented by BAG1, which contains a structurally and evolutionarily distinct BD. BDs from both BAG1 and BAG4 are three-helix bundles; however, in BAG4, each helix in this bundle is three to four turns shorter than its counterpart in BAG1, which reduces the length of the domain by one-third. BAG4 BD thus represents a prototype of the minimal functional fragment that is capable of binding to Hsc70 and modulating its chaperone activity.

The kinase activity was thought to be essential for a plethora of biological processes attributed to these enzymes. Here we show that at least one protein kinase C function, the induction of apoptosis by protein kinase Cδ, is independent of the kinase activity. Stimulation of green fluorescent protein-protein kinase Cδ fusion protein with phorbol ester or diacylglycerol led to its redistribution within seconds after the stimulus. Membrane blebbing, an early hallmark of apoptosis, was visible as early as 20 min after stimulation, and nuclear condensation was visible after 3–5 h. Apoptosis could be inhibited by expression of Bcl-2 but not by specific protein kinase C inhibitors. In addition, a kinase-negative mutant of protein kinase Cδ also induced apoptosis to the same extent as the wild type enzyme. Apoptosis was confined to the protein kinase Cδ-overexpressing cells. Stimulation of overexpressed protein kinase Cε did not result in increased apoptosis. Our results indicate that distinct protein kinase C isozymes induce apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. More importantly, they show that some protein kinase C effector functions are independent of the catalytic activity.

More importantly, they show that some protein kinase C effector functions are independent of the catalytic activity. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases comprising 10 isozymes that differ in their structure of up to four variable and three constant regions and their function (1Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These PKC isozymes are grouped into three classes: the “conventional” cPKCs PKC-α, -β (-βI and -βII), and -γ, which can be activated by diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, or phorbol esters and have a Ca2+-binding site in their second constant region, C2. The “novel” PKCs PKC-δ, -ε, -η, and -θ lack the C2 region and thus are Ca2+-independent but still diacylglycerol-, phosphatidylserine-, and phorbol ester-responsive, whereas the “atypical” PKCs PKC-ζ and -λ/ι also lack the C2 region and are therefore Ca2+-independent and only respond to phosphatidylserine and not to diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (3Dempsey E.C.

Hematol. 2000; 72: 12-19PubMed Google Scholar). Among other kinases, PKCs have been found to be involved in intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate growth and lead to differentiation and apoptosis (5Li W., Yu, J.C. Shin D.Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J.

The biochemical mechanism of PKC activation has been elucidated following the discoveries of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol activation and phosphorylation of conventional PKCs on the activation loop by the PKC-activating phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1). This initial phosphorylation triggers the autophosphorylation at carboxyl-terminal sites and thus the first step in order to generate the mature enzyme (8Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of all of the PKC isozymes are still largely unknown, and the role of PKCs in several important biological processes remains to be elucidated. Moreover, some reports about the function of PKCs are contradictory (9Webb P.R. Wang K.Q. Scheel-Toellner D. Pongracz J. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Wert M.M. Palfrey H.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to the expression of different PKC isozyme subsets in the cellular systems investigated. Structurally, the PKC isozymes are quite similar, and also their in vitro substrate specificity is nearly identical (11Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the isozymes fulfill distinct and different biological functions in vivo. For example, PKCδ reduces the proliferation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and arrests Chinese hamster ovary cells in the G2/M phase in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (12Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and induces differentiation of mouse promyeloid cells (6Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of PKCε in rodent fibroblasts stimulates cell proliferation, induces anchorage-independent growth, and causes tumors in nude mice (13Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, PKC has been implicated in apoptosis-mediating pathways for several years (3Dempsey E.C.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a major form of cell death characterized by well defined morphological changes like condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Among the biochemical mediators of apoptosis, particularly important is the participation of caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent, aspartate-specific proteases (17Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

One is triggered by the ligation of transmembrane death receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor R1 family by specific ligands, transmitting a death signal that culminates in classic apoptotic cell death (23Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5102) Google Scholar, 24****Google Scholar). Upon binding of their ligands, death receptors directly recruit and activate caspase-8. A second apoptotic pathway includes a mitochondrial amplification loop. The mitochondrial contribution is regulated by members of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL family acting on the mitochondrial membrane potential. After depolarization of the membrane potential in the course of an apoptotic signaling cascade, cytochrome c and/or apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is released from the mitochondria (25Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). AIF is localized at the intermembrane space and co-localizes with hsp60, which remains in the matrix, after AIF is released (26Daugas E. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Leber B. Andrews D. Penninger J. Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). AIF has recently been characterized as a novel flavoprotein with striking homology to bacterial and plant oxidoreductases (27Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Peleato M.L. Kroemer G. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16391-16398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Upon induction of apoptosis, AIF translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus in a caspase-independent fashion, which induces generation of large DNA fragments (∼50 kb) and chromatin condensation that resembles stage I nuclear apoptosis (26Daugas E. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Leber B. Andrews D. Penninger J. Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c, after release into the cytoplasm, binds to Apaf-1 to form a complex that activates caspase-9 as the most apical caspase in the following cascade of proteolytic modifications (28Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6172) Google Scholar). The first downstream target of caspase-9 is procaspase-3 (28Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6172) Google Scholar, 29Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 is indirectly regulated by members of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL family. Phorbol esters, and hence PKCs, have been shown to induce apoptosis in some cells and inhibit it in others (30Majumder P.K. Pandey P. Sun X. Cheng K. Datta R. Saxena S. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21793-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 31Romanova L.Y. Alexandrov I.A. Schwab G. Hilbert D.M. Mushinski J.F. Nordan R.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9900-9906Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell type appears to contribute to the results of phorbol ester treatment, most likely due to the varying spectrum of PKC isozymes expressed in different cells. When the contributions of activations of individual PKC isozymes were studied, it was generally agreed that PKCδ was proapoptotic in function. Indeed, overexpression of PKCδ in keratinocytes and in prostate cancer cells led to TPA-dependent induction of apoptosis (32Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T., Li, L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown PKCδ to be cleaved by caspase-3 in its third variable region, V3, to a catalytically active 40-kDa fragment in cells committed to apoptosis. This fragment was assumed to be associated with chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and lethality, and, therefore, PKCδ cleavage was thought to be a key feature in the induction of PKCδ-induced apoptosis (15Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp.

However, a recent report has demonstrated that PKCδ-mediated apoptosis did not depend on its proteolytic cleavage (33Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T., Li, L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). PKCδ has also been linked to the activation of caspase-3, leading to the presumption that PKCδ may play a role in apoptosis both upstream and downstream of the caspase cascade (36Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A. Quissell D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19115-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).PKCδ has been shown to translocate partly to the mitochondria upon stimulation of keratinocytes and U-937 leukemic cells with the phorbol ester TPA. This was accompanied by alteration of the mitochondrial membrane potential (32Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and release of cytochrome c(30Majumder P.K. Pandey P. Sun X. Cheng K. Datta R. Saxena S. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21793-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).These data suggested that PKCδ plays a major role in apoptosis via the mitochondrial amplification loop in several different cell types. Nonetheless, there are reports that suggest that PKCδ can inhibit apoptosis in other cells (31Romanova L.Y. Alexandrov I.A. Schwab G. Hilbert D.M. Mushinski J.F. Nordan R.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9900-9906Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PKCε, in contrast, has been described as a predominantly antiapoptotic isozyme (37Gubina E. Rinaudo M.S. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Mufson R.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 823-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Utilizing GFP-PKC expression vectors to examine PKCδ-induced apoptosis, we compared the potential of PKCδ and PKCε, the two most divert enzymes, to induce apoptosis in the rat aortic smooth muscle cell line A7r5. In addition, we investigated whether the kinase activity of PKCδ was essential to exert its apoptotic effect.DISCUSSIONSmooth muscle cells represent a cell type in which the role of PKC has been described as both pro- and antiapoptotic (10Wert M.M. Palfrey H.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 45Scheel-Toellner D. Pilling D. Akbar A.N. Hardie D. Lombardi G. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2603-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, we utilized A7r5, a rat aortic smooth muscle cell line, to thoroughly investigate the role of different PKC isozymes in apoptosis. We focused on PKCδ and PKCε, since these two isozymes appear to have opposing biological functions. Cells were transfected with the respective GFP-PKC expression vectors and examined for signs of apoptosis. The data presented here identify PKCδ as a signal-regulated key component of an apoptosis-inducing pathway that can trigger the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery. A key finding is that this function of PKCδ depends primarily on its translocation and subcellular localization but not on the kinase activity. As is evident from the control experiments, PKCδ, but not the GFP tag, was responsible for the induction of apoptosis, as was established by employing untagged PKCδ or GFP alone. First, untagged PKCδ was able to induce apoptosis to the same extent as the GFP-tagged PKCδ. Second, neither GFP alone nor GFP-PKCε could induce apoptosis. These experiments further showed that the induction of apoptosis was isozyme-specific, since GFP-PKCε (although this isozyme belongs to the same subgroup of the PKC family as PKCδ does) and also GFP-PKCβ1 as an exponent of the conventional isozymes did not induce apoptosis upon TPA stimulation. All three isozymes, however, are susceptible to phorbol ester stimulation. Therefore, it is obvious that the translocation-connected apoptotic effect is specific to PKCδ.Since activated protein kinase B/Akt transmits survival signals generated by binding of growth factors to their respective cell surface receptors (47Hong F. Nguyen V.A. Shen X. Kunos G. Gao B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we examined whether PKC overexpression might have influenced protein kinase B/Akt levels. We found that the overall amount of protein kinase B/Akt in PKCδ-overexpressing cells was slightly decreased compared with nontransfected cells. However, the levels of phosphorylated, and hence activated, protein kinase B/Akt were not significantly different in PKCδ-overexpressing or nontransfected cells.Accumulation of PKCδ at mitochondria 20 min or later after TPA stimulation could not be shown by optical means, and an induced co-localization of PKCδ with mitochondria could not be seen. Western analysis of mitochondria-enriched fractions after different time points of TPA stimulation showed ambiguous results, and no significant enrichment of PKCδ in the mitochondrial fraction could be determined. Moreover, no cleaved PKCδ was detected in stimulated cells overexpressing this isozyme. Nevertheless, the involvement of mitochondria in PKCδ-induced apoptosis is indubitable. Both the apoptosis-decreasing effect of Bcl-2 in cells stable transfected with this anti-apoptotic protein and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential upon TPA stimulation in cells transfected with PKCδ proved that the apoptotic effect of PKCδ occurs on the mitochondrial level. However, in the rat vascular smooth muscle cell line, A7r5, PKCδ obviously does not act directly on the mitochondrial level; rather, its effect is transmitted to the mitochondria through one or more PKCδ-binding proteins. Cleaved caspase-3 could not be detected after application of TPA, either in an immune histochemical assay or by Western analysis of cell lysates. Also, inhibition of caspases with the membrane-permeable caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk did not prevent apoptosis. Therefore, it is obvious that not the release of cytochromec, but rather the concomitant release of AIF or other caspase-independent reactions, appears to be the reason for the programmed cell death caused by the action of stimulated PKCδ. This assumption was further substantiated by the fact that DNA laddering, a typical sign of the caspase cascade-derived apoptosis, could not be observed. DNA fragments after AIF-mediated apoptosis are still too large to be detected in agarose gels.The most striking finding was the fact that PKCδ induced apoptosis independently from its kinase activity. The application of GF109203X, a specific PKC inhibitor, could not prevent apoptosis, once the cells were exposed to the phorbol ester. The widely used inhibitor “rottlerin” was supposed to be specific for PKCδ, but recent research has revealed that this is not the case (46Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37986-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we omitted the use of this inhibitor and favored the above mentioned bisindolylmaleimide derivative instead. More specifically, when cells were transfected with a kinase-negative mutant of PKCδ, this mutant PKCδ still translocated, and cells still underwent apoptosis after TPA stimulation. Cells were also transfected with “empty” vectors, either solely expressing GFP or with wild-type adenovirus. In neither case was induction of apoptosis increased compared with untransfected cells when stimulated with TPA. These experiments rule out effects due to the vector. However, there seems to be an effect due to the kinase activity. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the percentage of apoptotic cells in experiments with kinase-deficient PKCδ mutants is slightly but significantly lower than in PKCδ-positive cells. However, the application of the PKC inhibitor increased the apoptosis rate in both cases. The data presented here (i.e. the induction of apoptosis by PKCδ independently of its kinase activity) are not in agreement with work published by other groups (32Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T., Li, L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This discrepancy cannot be fully explained yet, but it may result from the different cell lines used. Since translocation seemed to be essential for PKCδ to induce apoptosis, we assume that this isozyme exerts its apoptogenic effect by binding to distinct intracellular structures, especially by interaction with target proteins, yet to be determined. This interaction may occur on a one-to-one basis and therefore necessitate larger amounts of PKCδ protein than intrinsically present in A7r5 cells. If the kinase activity were responsible for inducing apoptosis upon phorbol ester application, the low amount of intrinsic PKCδ would be sufficient to accomplish programmed cell death after TPA. This explains the fact that untransfected cells, which express only low levels of endogenous PKCδ, show no sign of apoptosis when stimulated with TPA. Also, PKCδ obviously does not directly act on the mitochondrial level, but it does affect the mitochondria apparently indirectly at such a rate that their membrane potential quickly depolarizes. Moreover, this supports our finding that the catalytic activity of PKCδ was not the origin of its apoptogenic effect, but this effect derived from its character as a signal-regulated binding/scaffolding protein. The target proteins for PKCδ that are responsible for the induction of apoptosis are most likely antiapoptotic proteins associated with the mitochondria, such as Bcl-2 family members. Our assumption is supported by the observation that mitochondrial membranes quickly depolarize when apoptosis is initiated by TPA and also that Bcl-2 is capable of decreasing the degree of PKCδ-induced apoptosis considerably. However, we have not yet determined the postulated PKCδ-associated protein(s). Our results reveal PKCδ as a multifunctional protein, whose biological role is not solely determined by its kinase activity but also by its function as capping or scavenging protein that binds to “antiapoptotic” target proteins. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases comprising 10 isozymes that differ in their structure of up to four variable and three constant regions and their function (1Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). These PKC isozymes are grouped into three classes: the “conventional” cPKCs PKC-α, -β (-βI and -βII), and -γ, which can be activated by diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, or phorbol esters and have a Ca2+-binding site in their second constant region, C2. The “novel” PKCs PKC-δ, -ε, -η, and -θ lack the C2 region and thus are Ca2+-independent but still diacylglycerol-, phosphatidylserine-, and phorbol ester-responsive, whereas the “atypical” PKCs PKC-ζ and -λ/ι also lack the C2 region and are therefore Ca2+-independent and only respond to phosphatidylserine and not to diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (3Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Musashi M. Ota S. Shiroshita N. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 72: 12-19PubMed Google Scholar). Among other kinases, PKCs have been found to be involved in intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate growth and lead to differentiation and apoptosis (5Li W., Yu, J.C. Shin D.Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J.

The biochemical mechanism of PKC activation has been elucidated following the discoveries of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol activation and phosphorylation of conventional PKCs on the activation loop by the PKC-activating phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1). This initial phosphorylation triggers the autophosphorylation at carboxyl-terminal sites and thus the first step in order to generate the mature enzyme (8Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of all of the PKC isozymes are still largely unknown, and the role of PKCs in several important biological processes remains to be elucidated. Moreover, some reports about the function of PKCs are contradictory (9Webb P.R. Wang K.Q. Scheel-Toellner D. Pongracz J. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Wert M.M. Palfrey H.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to the expression of different PKC isozyme subsets in the cellular systems investigated. Structurally, the PKC isozymes are quite similar, and also their in vitro substrate specificity is nearly identical (11Kazanietz M.G. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Kolch W. Mischak H. Wong G. Pettit G.R. Bruns J.D. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the isozymes fulfill distinct and different biological functions in vivo. For example, PKCδ reduces the proliferation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and arrests Chinese hamster ovary cells in the G2/M phase in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (12Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and induces differentiation of mouse promyeloid cells (6Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of PKCε in rodent fibroblasts stimulates cell proliferation, induces anchorage-independent growth, and causes tumors in nude mice (13Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, PKC has been implicated in apoptosis-mediating pathways for several years (3Dempsey E.C.

Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), but again, there is little consensus on its role. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a major form of cell death characterized by well defined morphological changes like condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Among the biochemical mediators of apoptosis, particularly important is the participation of caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent, aspartate-specific proteases (17Salvese"

Here we show that UCE is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme that is activated by the endoprotease furin, which cleaves an RARLPR↓D sequence to release a 24-amino acid propiece. As furin is localized in the trans-Golgi network, newly synthesized UCE is inactive until it reaches this terminal Golgi compartment. LoVo cells (derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma) lack furin activity and have extremely low UCE activity. Addition of furin to LoVo cell extracts restores UCE activity to normal levels, demonstrating that the UCE proenzyme is stable in this cell type. LoVo cells secrete acid hydrolases with phosphomannose diesters as a consequence of the deficient UCE activity. This demonstrates for the first time that UCE is the only enzyme in these cells capable of efficiently uncovering phosphomannose diesters. UCE also hydrolyzes UDP-GlcNAc, a sugar donor for Golgi N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases.

Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). This generates the Man-6-P recognition marker, which mediates the specific and high-affinity binding of the acid hydrolases to Man-6-P receptors in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The receptors with their cargo molecules are then packaged into transport vesicles for delivery to lysosomes (1Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev.

UCE is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is mainly localized to the TGN and cycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Human UCE is composed of 515 amino acids containing a 24-amino acid signal sequence, a luminal domain of 423 residues, a 27-residue transmembrane region, and a 41-residue cytoplasmic tail (3Kornfeld R.

UCE purified from bovine liver is missing the signal peptide as well as a 24-residue propeptide (3Kornfeld R. Bao M. Brewer K. Noll C. Canfield W. J. Biol.

Examination of the amino acids upstream of the cleavage site revealed an RARLPR sequence, which is known to serve as a furin cleavage site (5Molloy S. Bresnahan P. Leppla S. Klimpel K. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furin, a calcium-dependent subtilisin-like serine endoprotease, is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that, like UCE, is predominantly localized to the TGN (6Molloy S. Anderson E. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that the propiece of UCE is cleaved by furin in the TGN. In this study, we provide a variety of evidence that, in fact, furin is the endoprotease that removes the propeptide from UCE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pro-UCE has little or no enzyme activity, establishing that excision of the propeptide is essential for the generation of an active enzyme. Finally, we present a hypothesis for why it may be advantageous to delay activation of UCE until it reaches the TGN.

The mouse HPC4 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Dr. Charles Esmon (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) (7Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-UCE propeptide serum (NZW-HD-9B) was prepared by immunization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 24-amino acid propeptide of human UCE, and rabbit anti-rh-UCE (NZW-HD-1A) serum was prepared by immunization with rh-UCE lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains. Mouse L cells and L cells expressing wild-type (WT 1–38) or mutant (Y488A) human UCE were obtained from Rosalind Kornfeld (Washington University) and grown as described (2Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). LoVo human colon adenocarcinoma cells (CCL-229) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and grown in Kaighn's modification of Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO-K1 cells and SF+cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and from Protein Sciences Corporation, respectively. UCE was assayed as previously described using [3H]GlcNAc-α-Me-P-Man as substrate (8Mullis K.G. Ketcham C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as 1 nmol of [3H]GlcNAc released per h. β-Glucuronidase and β-hexosaminidase activities were determined fluorometrically. The reactions were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C in a 100-μl volume containing 5 mm4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide or 4-methylumbelliferylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide in 0.1m sodium acetate (pH 5.0). The reactions were stopped by addition of 900 μl of 0.1 m sodium carbonate solution, and the fluorescence was determined in a Turner digital fluorometer. The molecular cloning and expression of wild-type human UCE has been described previously (3Kornfeld R. Bao M. Brewer K. Noll C. Canfield W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32778-32785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This plasmid, designated as pTriplEx/UCE, was used as the starting material for the construction of recombinant soluble epitope-tagged UCE. Several intermediate plasmids (pKB3, pKB4, and pKB5) were constructed to provide the appropriate DNA fragments with the necessary restriction sites. Plasmid pKB3 was constructed by inserting a pair of complementary oligonucleotide linkers (CANF381, 5′-CCGGGACGCGTCCATGGGAGGAGAGGCCGGCCCCTGAGGT-3′; and CANF382, 5′-GATCTGGAGTCCCCGGCCGGAGAGGAGGGTACCTGCGCAG-3′) into pUC19 (New England Biolabs Inc.) between the XmaI and XbaI restriction sites. Plasmid pKB4 was constructed by ligating theFseI-Bsu36I fragment of pTriplEx/UCE (amino acids 93–437 of human UCE), the XbaI-BsaI and BsaI-FseI fragments of pKB3, and a set of oligonucleotide linkers that encodes the epitope for the HPC4 antibody (CANF353, 5′-TGAGGGCGGGAGAACTCTCCTTTTTCACCAGG-3′; CANF354, 5′-CCCGCCCTCTTGAGAGGAAAAAGTGGTCCCTCC-3′; CANF355, 5′-GAGGACCAGGTGGACCCCAGGCTGATCGACGGCAAGGATTGATGAT-3′; and CANF356, 5′-TGGTCCACCTGGGGTCCGACTAGCTGCCGTTCCTAACTACTAGATC-3′). Plasmid pKB5 was constructed by ligating the BseRI-FseI fragment of pTriplEx/UCE (amino acids 7–92 of human UCE), theMluI-NcoI fragment of pcDNA4 (Invitrogen) that encodes the cytomegalovirus promoter and the vascular endothelial growth factor enhancer, the FseI-BsaI and BsaI-MluI fragments of pKB3, and a pair of oligonucleotide linkers (CANF357, 5′-CATGGCGACCTCCACGGGTC-3′; and CANF358, 5′-GGGCACCTCCAGCG-3′) that encodes the start codon and the first six amino acids of human UCE. The final plasmid construct, designated as pKB6, was generated by ligating theFseI-HindIII fragment of pKB4, theMluI-FseI fragment of pKB5, and theMluI-HindIII fragment of the pEE14 expression vector (Lonza Biologics). The resultant plasmid (pKB6) encodes human UCE lacking the transmembrane sequence, which is replaced with the epitope for the HPC4 antibody. The pEE14 expression vector contains the glutamine synthetase minigene for selection and amplification in glutamine-free medium containing methionine sulfoximine (MSX), which inhibits endogenous glutamine synthetase activity. CHO-K1 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at ∼60% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and each dish was transfected with 6 μg of pKB6 and 18 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A mock transfection using phosphate-buffered saline was also performed to serve as the negative control plates. On the following day, the mock- and pKB6-transfected cells were trypsinized and plated in 96-well plates at a cell concentration of 1000 cells/well in 100 μl of Glasgow's minimal essential medium lacking l-glutamine, but containing 10% FBS. On the 3rd day, 100 μl of Glasgow's minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS and 50 μm MSX was added to each well to obtain a final MSX concentration of 25 μm. These plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until single colonies were detected, and the mock transfectants were abolished. MSX inhibits the endogenous glutamine synthetase; and thus, only cells that had integrated the pKB6 plasmid (containing the glutamine synthetase minigene) into their genome survived. This MSX selection process yielded 11 clones as detected by visual inspection of the 96-well plates using an inverted light microscope (Nikon). These clones were designated as UCE clones MB1–11. The UCE MB clones were expanded and subsequently amplified in 96-well plates at various MSX concentrations (100–500 μm). The clones with amplified UCE expression were initially identified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using HPC4 as the capture antibody, a rabbit anti-rh-UCE polyclonal primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. These amplified UCE clones were also assayed for UCE activity. A rapidly growing MSX-amplified UCE clone with high UCE expression (designated as UCE108) was identified from a 96-well plate containing 300 μm MSX via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was derived from the unamplified parent clone MB7. Clone UCE108 was expanded and used for the production of rh-UCE. Plasmid pKB6 was used to construct a plasmid encoding soluble epitope-tagged human UCE in an insect expression system (performed at Protein Sciences, Inc.). PCR was performed using pKB6 and gene-specific primers O-1987/O-1989 to generate the N terminus of the mature human UCE region and the C-terminal fragment of the signal sequence fromAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). A parallel PCR was performed to generate the polyhedrin promoter and the AcNPV signal sequence. A third PCR was performed to fuse the N terminus of mature human UCE with the AcNPV promoter/signal sequence containing a 5′-EcoRV restriction site and a 3′-BglII site via overlap extension. The resultant PCR product was digested withEcoRV and BglII and ligated into an intermediate plasmid. This intermediate plasmid was then digested withKpnI and XbaI to linearize the plasmid within the UCE coding region. The remaining UCE fragment was obtained by digesting pKB6 with KpnI and XbaI and ligating this fragment into the linearized intermediate plasmid to complete the transfer plasmid designated as pAcD1062. The DNA sequence was verified by automated fluorescence DNA sequencing, and pAcD1062 was used to generate the baculovirus transfer vector. To generate the baculovirus vector via homologous recombination, the transfer plasmid pAcD1062 was cotransfected with linearized AcNPV baculovirus genomic DNA for 3 days. The cotransfected cells were subsequently harvested by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used to grow isolated plaques on plates containing Sf9 insect cells. Several plaques with the clear (versus cloudy) plaque phenotype were identified from this process and used as the viral stocks. The expression of rh-UCE in insect cells was performed at Protein Sciences, Inc. A passage 1 viral stock of recombinant baculovirus was prepared by adding the appropriate plaque to a 5-ml culture of Sf9 insect cells in medium containing 5% FBS for 5 days at 28 °C. The infected cells were subsequently harvested by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used to inoculate larger cultures. One milliliter of the passage 1 viral stock was used to inoculate 50-ml cultures of expres SF+(SF+) cells in serum-free medium at a cell density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in 100-ml Spinner flasks for 48 h at 28 °C. The infected cultures were harvested by low-speed centrifugation, and the supernatants comprising the passage 2 viral stocks were used to seed 500-ml SF+ cultures at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in 3-liter Spinner flasks for 48 h at 28 °C. The cultures were again harvested, and 1 ml of the supernatant (passage 2 viral stock) was used to seed 500-ml SF+ cultures in 3-liter Spinner flasks at the same cell density in serum-free medium for 72 h at 28 °C to generate the passage 3 viral stock. The passage 3 viral stock was titered by plaque assay, and a 500-ml SF+ culture was infected with the passage 3 viral stock at a multiplicity of infection of 1 plaque-forming unit/cell and incubated at 28 °C. One-hundred milliliters of the culture was harvested by low-speed centrifugation after 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. The supernatants were frozen at −80 °C, and the 96-h post-infection supernatant was sent to Novazyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for affinity purification. Clone UCE108 was expanded from six T-150 flasks up to 102 roller bottles in Glasgow's minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS and 25 μm MSX and cultured for 10 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Twenty liters of conditioned medium was then collected, clarified, and concentrated ∼3-fold via a tangential flow filtration system (Millipore Corp.). The concentrated medium was subsequently divided into four aliquots and frozen at −20 °C until purification. rh-UCE was affinity-purified in four different preparations using a 30-ml HPC4-UltraLink affinity column. Monoclonal antibody HPC4 is calcium-dependent; therefore, CaCl2 was added to the concentrated medium to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the HPC4-UltraLink column was equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), and 5 mm CaCl2. The medium was loaded onto the antibody column and washed with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), and 1 mm CaCl2. rh-UCE was eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), and 5 mm EDTA; concentrated via a Centriprep Plus-80 concentrator (Millipore Corp.); aliquoted into ∼25-μl fractions; and stored at −80 °C. Each rh-UCE preparation was assayed for UCE activity and characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the HPC4 primary antibody, and the protein concentration was determined via absorbance at 280 nm using the Advanced protein assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). The average purification efficiency and yield of the four rh-UCE preparations from CHO cells are shown in Table I.Table IPurification of rh-UCESampleVolumeProtein concTotal proteinActivityTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurification (fold)mlmg/mlmgunits/mlunitsunits/mg%-foldCHO cellsMedium (3× conc)140017.424,3608.7 × 10312.2 × 1065011001HPC4 eluate144.644.611.1 × 10611.1 × 1062.5 × 10591499SF+cellsMedium10015.215206 × 1036 × 1053951001HPC4 eluate10.520.522.85 × 1052.85 × 1055.5 × 105481392 Open table in a new tab Insect cell-derived rh-UCE was affinity-purified as described for CHO cell-derived rh-UCE except that only 100 ml of the 96-h post-infected conditioned medium was used with a 5-ml HPC4-UltraLink column. Insect cell-derived rh-UCE was also assayed and characterized as described above. The average purification efficiency and yield of the rh-UCE preparation from insect cells are also shown in Table I. Two-hundred nanograms of each PNGase F-digested rh-UCE sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). rh-UCE was transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer system. The membrane was subsequently blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm CaCl2 (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. The blot was then incubated with the mouse HPC4 monoclonal primary antibody (1 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature with rocking. The blot was washed three times with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmCaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 15 min between each wash. The blot was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (AmershamBiosciences) diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature with rocking. The blot was washed as before and incubated with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm CaCl2 for 15 min. rh-UCE was visualized by incubating the blot with 1 ml of ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, wrapped in plastic wrap, and exposed on BioMax x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Three micrograms each of purified rh-UCE from insect and CHO cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide gel) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (AmershamBiosciences) using the Bio-Rad semidry transfer system. The protein bands were visualized by Ponceau S staining, and the rh-UCE bands were excised using a scalpel. The rh-UCE samples were subjected to N-terminal sequencing via the Edman degradation method and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis (performed at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center). The amino acid sequence of CHO cell-derived rh-UCE is shown in Table II.Table IIN-terminal sequencing of CHO cell-derived rh-UCECycleAmino acidUnprocessedProcessed%%1Leu, Asp69312Asp100ND3Ser, Thr60404Gly100ND5Ala, Val68326Ser100ND7Arg100ND8Asp, Gly64369Asp, Asn554510Asp100ND11Leu, Glu7129 Open table in a new tab β-Glucuronidase and β-hexosaminidase present in cell secretions were fractionated on a Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor affinity column essentially as previously described (9Faust P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, media from LoVo and L cell cultures were collected and applied to the receptor affinity column (1 × 1 cm). The column was washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (the flow-through fraction), then with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm Glc-6-P (the retarded fraction), and finally with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm Man-6-P (the bound/eluted fraction). Aliquots of the three fractions were assayed for β-glucuronidase and β-hexosaminidase activities. To demonstrate the effect of UCE on the secreted hydrolases, 1-ml aliquots of the media were treated with 10 units of rh-UCE for 4 h at 37 °C and then applied to the affinity column and fractionated as described above. Similarly, to differentiate between hydrolases with phosphomonoestersversus multiple phosphodiesters, 1-ml aliquots of the media were treated with 50 units of E. coli alkaline phosphatase at pH 8.0 for 12 h at 37 °C. The reactions were adjusted to pH 7.4 and then subjected to fractionation on the receptor column. As part of a project to prepare soluble forms of UCE, the cDNA encoding human UCE was mutated to introduce a stop codon just proximal to the transmembrane domain and then expressed in CHO and SF+ insect cells. The expression vector for the insect cells was further modified to include an insect viral signal peptide in place of the UCE signal peptide and a deletion of the propeptide (Fig. 1). When rh-UCE secreted from the two cell types was purified and assayed, it was noted that the specific activity of the CHO cell-produced enzyme was only 45% that of the insect cell-secreted enzyme (Table I). Determination of the N-terminal sequence of rh-UCE produced by the CHO cells revealed that only 35% of the enzyme was the mature form, whereas 65% remained as the proenzyme (Table II). To confirm the presence of the propeptide in a portion of CHO cell-produced rh-UCE, a rabbit antibody was generated to the propeptide sequence. As shown in Fig.2, this antiserum reacted with CHO cell-produced rh-UCE, but not with rh-UCE secreted by the insect cells. The enzymes from both sources reacted with rabbit antiserum prepared against full-length rh-UCE as expected.FIG. 2Distinction of pro-UCE and mature UCE by dot-blot analysis. Three identical nitrocellulose dot blots were prepared using 200 ng of rh-UCE derived from either insect or CHO cells. A rh-UCE molecule engineered to contain an improved furin cleavage site (DB-1 rh-UCE) was also expressed in CHO cells and spotted onto each membrane. A buffer control (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), and 5 mm EDTA) was also included in each dot blot. The dot blots were subsequently treated as described for the immunoblots under “Experimental Procedures,” except that the blot in A was incubated with rabbit anti-UCE propeptide serum (NZW-HD-9B, diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer), the blot in B was incubated with rabbit preimmune serum, and the blot in C was incubated with protein A-purified rabbit anti-rh-UCE (whole molecule) polyclonal antibody (NZW-HD-1A, diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer). The detection antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer; Amersham Biosciences).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fact that only 35% of rh-UCE secreted by the CHO cells was the mature form and that this material had only 45% the specific activity of insect cell-derived rh-UCE, which was completely the mature form, suggested that the pro-form of rh-UCE may have little or no enzyme activity. Evidence that this is indeed the case was obtained by treating rh-UCE produced by the CHO cells with furin, which was predicted to cleave the propeptide. As shown in Fig.3, furin treatment resulted in a marked increase in enzyme activity to the level observed with the enzyme expressed by insect cells. CHO cell-derived rh-UCE incubated in the absence of furin exhibited no change in its activity, and furin had no effect on the activity of insect cell-derived rh-UCE. Examination of CHO cell-derived rh-UCE by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody HPC4 following deglycosylation with PNGase F revealed two bands corresponding to the pro-form and mature form of the enzyme (Fig. 4). Treatment of this material with furin caused the conversion of the pro-form to the mature form. This did not occur in the absence of furin. Furthermore, furin had no effect on insect cell-derived rh-UCE, demonstrating that furin cleaves only the propeptide of UCE.FIG. 4Pro-UCE is cleaved by furin. Twenty micrograms each of baculovirus expression vector system and CHO cell-produced rh-UCE were treated with 20 units of furin at 30 °C, and aliquots were removed after 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. The baculovirus expression vector system and CHO cell-produced enzymes without furin treatment were used as negative controls. The UCE samples were then deglycosylated by incubation with PNGase F, and 200 ng of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the mouse HPC4 primary antibody and horseradish-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The experiments with CHO cell-derived rh-UCE clearly show that furin is capable of cleaving the propeptide of UCE. However, these results do not establish that furin is the endoprotease that acts on UCE in cells. This is an issue because furin is a member of a large family of proprotein convertases (6Molloy S. Anderson E. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To test whether furin is involved in the activation of UCE in intact cells, we turned to LoVo cells, derived from a lymph node metastasis of a human colon adenocarcinoma (10Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T. Duguay S.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26565-26569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These cells are known to have a total deficiency of furin activity due to mutations in the furin gene (10Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T. Duguay S.J. Van de Ven W.J.M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26565-26569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Assay of LoVo cell extracts for UCE activity revealed that these cells had less than 10% the activity of mouse L cells (Table III). When LoVo cell extracts were treated with different concentrations of furin for 4 h, the UCE activity increased up to 17-fold to the level observed in the mouse L cell extract (Table III). Furin treatment had no effect on the UCE activity of the mouse L cell extract or an extract of mouse L cells (the WT 1–38 line) that express high levels of rh-UCE (Table III). This demonstrates that the conversion of the pro-form of UCE to the mature enzyme is quite efficient in the L cells. The activation of UCE in the LoVo cell extract by furin was time-dependent, as shown in Fig. 5. These results demonstrate that the LoVo cells contain UCE in an inactive form (presumably the pro-form) that can be activated by furin. Because these cells have a selective deficit in furin activity, we conclude that UCE is specifically activated by furin.Table IIIEffect of furin on UCE activity in cell extractsAdditionMouse L cellsWT 1–38 cellsLoVo cellsNone0.272.920.021 unit furin0.102 units furin0.262.970.274 units furin0.34 Open table in a new tab We next tested the effect of the furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (11Stieneke-Grober A.

For this experiment, the CHO cells expressing rh-UCE were incubated with various concentrations of the inhibitor for 72 h, and then secreted rh-UCE was purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 6, the inhibitor caused a concentration-dependent shift in secreted rh-UCE from the mature form to the pro-form. This was associated with a decrease in the specific activity of the enzyme. When UCE synthesized in the presence of 20 μm furin inhibitor I was treated with furin, all of the pro-form was converted to the mature enzyme along with the restoration of the enzyme activity (Fig.6, sixth lane). These data provide additional evidence that UCE maturation is mediated by furin. In considering why it may be advantageous to activate pro-UCE only after it reaches the TGN, we noted the reports that partially purified detergent-solubilized preparations of UCE cleave GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc (12Varki A.

Rat hepatic stellate cells were cultured in the presence of 200 μm malondialdehyde, and the effects on collagen gene expression and the binding of nuclear proteins to thecol1a1 promoter were analyzed. Malondialdehyde treatment induced an increase in the cellular levels ofcol1a1 mRNA that was abrogated by pretreating cells with cycloheximide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and mithramycin. Transient transfections showed that malondialdehyde exerted its effect through regulatory elements located between −220 and −110 bp of the col1a1 promoter. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that malondialdehyde increased the binding of nuclear proteins to two elements located between −161 and −110 bp of the col1a1 promoter. These bindings were supershifted with Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies. Finally, malondialdehyde increased cellular levels of the Sp1 and Sp3 proteins and Sp1 mRNA.

Mechanisms by which these reactive aldehydes induce col1a1gene expression and synthesis are still unclear. However, a number of studies have provided evidence supporting the role of aldehyde-protein adducts in the regulation of col1a1 gene expression. These aldehydes are known to react with sulfhydryl or amino groups to form aldehyde-protein adducts (7Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). These adducts have been found in alcoholic liver disease (8Ohhira M. Ohtake T. Matsumoto A. Saito H. Ikuta K. Fujimoto Y. Ono M.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanisms by which MDA inducescol1a1 gene expression, particularly the transcription factors and cis-acting elements involved in the mediation of this effect. Minimum essential Eagle's medium with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HMEM), collagenase type VII, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pHMB), mithramycin, MDA, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (P5P), and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim and BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium. Plastic cell culture flasks and dishes were from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark). Agarose and Bradford protein reagent were from Bio-Rad. Nylon filters HybondTM, l-[3H]proline (specific activity, 43 Ci/mmol), [14H]chloramphenicol (specific activity, 56 mCi/mmol), and [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.

Tugores (University of California, San Diego). c-Krox protein and c-Krox antibody was a gift by Dr. Philippe Galéra (Laboratoire de Biochimie du Tissu Conjonctif, Faculté de Médecine, Caen, France). HSC were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats as described originally by Friedman and Roll (19Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), with the minor modifications introduced by Rippe et al.(20Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 10% FBS, and 2% l-glutamine in a 95% air, 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Growth medium was changed on a daily basis for the 1st week in culture and then every 3rd day thereafter. By using this procedure, we obtained an HSC population 95–99% pure. The effect of MDA was examined by addition of this agent to cells cultured in serum-free medium. The p(−3700)ColCAT, p(−905)ColCAT, and p(−220)ColCAT (17Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Leffert H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) constructs contain theXbaI-XbaI (nucleotides −3700 to +116), thePvuII-XbaI (nucleotides −905to +116), or theBglII-XbaI (nucleotides −220 to +116) fragment, respectively, and the 5′-untranslated region of the first exon of thecol1a1 gene fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The vector plasmid pUCCAT, also containing the CAT gene, was obtained by digesting p(−3700)ColCAT (16Rippe R.A. Lorenzen S.I. Brenner D.A. Breindl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2224-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with XbaI, removing the XbaI-XbaI fragment, and ligating both ends. The reporter plasmid p(−111)ColCAT was constructed as described elsewhere (21Garcı́a-Ruı́z I. de la Torre P. Dı́az T. Esteban E. Morillas J.D. Muñoz-Yagüe M.T. Solı́s-Herruzo J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid p(−126)Luc was constructed by subcloning the fragment −126 to +58 of the T-cell-specific mal gene promoter into the promoterless plasmid p19Luc. This plasmid contains two consensus sites for nuclear factor Sp1 (18Tugores A. Rubio A. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the reporter plasmid pΔSLuc, Sp1cis-acting elements of the p(−126)Luc had been deleted (18Tugores A. Rubio A. Rancaño C. Alonso M.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mutated plasmids p(−905ΔFP2)ColCAT and p(-905ΔFP2/ΔFP3)ColCAT were constructed using the technique of site-directed mutagenesis described by Ho et al. (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The PCR products were inserted into the p(−905)ColCAT vector after removing the fragment PvuII-XbaI. In the p(−905ΔFP2)ColCAT construct, the binding site for Sp1 and Sp3 extending from −129 to −110 bp had been converted from GGGGGCCGGGCC into GGGAACCTGGCC. In addition to this mutation, in the p(−905ΔFP2/ΔFP3)ColCAT construct, the sequence between −161 and −133 bp, the binding site for Sp1 and Sp3, had been converted from CCCCCCTCTT to CCAAACTCTT. Mobility shift assays confirmed that recombinant Sp1 does not bind oligonucleotides containing these mutated sequences (data not shown). All constructions and the orientation of the inserts were tested by restriction analysis and limited DNA sequencing by using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HSC were incubated as described above in DMEM without FBS in the presence or absence of MDA and processed as described previously (21Garcı́a-Ruı́z I. de la Torre P. Dı́az T. Esteban E. Morillas J.D.

Rowe (Farmington, CT). The col1a1cDNA probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) using a primer extension kit (Multiprime DNA labeling system; from Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm per mg of DNA. Nuclear proteins from HSC untreated and treated with 200 μm MDA were extracted according to the method of Dignamet al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of Dignam C buffer, and protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford protein assay reagent (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays were performed as described by Nehls et al. (26Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in these assays are shown in Table I. For competition experiments, 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to binding reactions. Supershift assays were performed as a standard mobility shift assay, except that 1 μl of specific polyclonal antiserum raised against Sp1, Sp3, NF-1, BTEB, Zf9, AP2, βC/EBP, or c-Krox was added to the binding reaction for 1 h at 0 °C. Sp1 antibody is specific for Sp1 and does not cross-react with Sp3 or other members of the Sp family. Likewise, Sp3 antibody is specific for Sp3 protein and does not cross-react with Sp1.Table IOligonucleotides used in gel retardation assays In general, 5 × 106 HSC were transiently transfected prior to confluence by the LipofectAMINE technique (27Solı́s-Herruzo J.A.

Cell lysates were prepared, and CAT activity was determined as described elsewhere (28Solı́s-Herruzo J.A. Hernández I. de la Torre P. Garcı́a I. Sánchez J.A. Fernández I. Cartellano G. Muñoz-Yagüe M.T. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined using the enhanced luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego). Cell lysates were prepared in 125 μl of cell lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was determined using 50-μl aliquots, and protein concentrations were determined with 5-μg aliquots using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). All reporter genes were normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting a constant amount ofpRSVβ-Gal reporter gene and determining β-galactosidase activity (29Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise mentioned. Student's t test was used to evaluate the difference of means between groups, accepting ap value of <0.05 as the level of significance (30Colton T. Estadı́stica en Medicina. Salvat Editores, S.A., Barcelona, Spain1979Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with MDA led to a significant increase in the steady-state level of col1a1 mRNA without change in the 18 S RNA. This effect was time- and dose-dependent. Northern blots showed thatcol1a1 mRNA levels in HSC incubated in HMEM without FBS were increased 1.5-, 2-, 2.3-, 2.8-, and 3.3-fold over the control level after incubation with 25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 μmMDA, respectively, for 24 h (Fig.1A). Likewise, col1a1 mRNA levels increased 1.1-, 1.0-, 1.8-, 2.2-, and 2.6-fold over the control level in cells treated with 200 μm MDA for 1, 2, 6, 16, and 24 h, respectively (Fig.1B). This effect of MDA was prevented by pretreating cells with 0.1 mm cycloheximide (Fig.2A) and with 4 μmpHMB or 10 mm P5P, two inhibitors of the aldehyde-protein adduct formation (Fig.2B). None of these agents was toxic to the HSC at these concentrations.FIG. 2Effects of cycloheximide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate on MDA-activated col1a1 gene expression. A, confluent cells were incubated with 100 μm cycloheximide (CHX) for 1 h prior to the addition of 200 μm MDA. Treatment was maintained for another 24 h. B, cells were treated with 4 μmpHMB for 1 h. After this time, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 200 μm MDA for another 23 h. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (10 mm) and MDA (200 μm) were added to the cells at the same time. This treatment was maintained for 24 h.Histograms represent relative col1a1 mRNA expression with control assigned a value of 1 and refer to mean ± S.E.

This effect was totally abrogated by pretreating HSC with 4 μmpHMB. Deletion of promoter sequences upstream of −220 bp relative to the transcription start site increased the basal CAT activity 4.4-fold (Fig. 3E) but did not abrogate the stimulatory effect of MDA on col1a1 gene expression (Fig. 3B). By contrast, HSC transfected with the construct p(−111)Col1a1, lacking sequences upstream of −110 bp, did not respond to MDA (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the MDA-responsive element is located in sequences between −220 and −111 bp relative to the transcription start site of the col1a1promoter. Because the 220 bp upstream of the transcription start point in thecol1a1 promoter contains four regions protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear proteins from a number of cell types (16Rippe R.A.

Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hernández I., De la Torre P. Rey-Campos J. Garcı́a I. Muñoz R. Muñoz-Yagüe T. Solı́s-Herruzo J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 341-352Google Scholar), we studied whether treatment of HSC with 200 μm MDA induced any change in the binding of nuclear proteins to these elements. Gel retardation experiments showed that incubation of a 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide containing sequences between −103 and −82 bp (FP1) with nuclear protein extracts from either untreated cells or cells treated with 200 μm MDA for 1–24 h led to the formation of two major specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4). However, few changes in the pattern or intensity of the retarded bands were observed whether the nuclear protein used in this assay was extracted from control or MDA-treated cells. A 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide abrogated the formation of the upper complex, whereas the same excess of unlabeled NF1 oligonucleotide failed to compete significantly with nuclear proteins for the binding to the FP1 probe (Fig. 4). These results suggest that treatment of HSC with the MDA does not influence the interaction of nuclear proteins with FP1. To examine the effect of the treatment of cells with MDA on the interaction of nuclear proteins with the element extending from −129 bp to −110 bp (FP2) of the col1a1 promoter, we performed DNA mobility assays using as a radiolabeled probe the FP2 oligonucleotide. Incubation of this probe with nuclear protein extracts from either untreated or treated cells with 200 μm MDA for 1–24 h also led to the formation of two specific DNA-protein complexes. However, the intensity of these bands was clearly more pronounced when nuclear extract was prepared from cells treated with MDA for 6 or more hours (Fig.5A). The FP2 contains a reverse CCAAT motif and a 12-bp G + C-rich direct repeat (26Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that the trans-acting factors NF-1 and Sp1 interact with this footprinted region in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (26Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed competition assays with 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides with high affinity for either NF-1 or Sp1. As Fig.5A demonstrates, the excess of NF-1 unlabeled oligonucleotide did not compete significantly with the formation of any of these bands, whereas the 200-fold molar excess of Sp1 oligonucleotide totally competed with the formation of the upper DNA-protein complex and partially with the lower one. To confirm that Sp1 is involved in the formation of the FP2-protein complexes, we performed supershift assays by including in the binding reaction an Sp1-specific polyclonal antibody. This incubation led to the formation of a supershifted complex and to a marked decrease in the intensity of the upper band (Fig. 5B). In an attempt to identify other nuclear factors bound to FP2, supershift assays using polyclonal antisera against Sp3, BTEB, NF1, Zf9, AP2, C/EBPβ, or c-Krox were also performed. Whereas BTEB, NF1, Zf9, AP2, C/EBPβ, and c-Krox antibodies failed to supershift any band, Sp3 antiserum supershifted almost completely the lower band (Fig. 5B). In addition, incubation of nuclear extracts and FP2 probe with Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies simultaneously supershifted both bands. Gel retardation experiments were performed to analyze the effect of MDA treatment on the binding of nuclear proteins to the remaining two DNase I-protected regions. Incubation of nuclear extracts from confluent HSC with a radiolabeled FP3 oligonucleotide (−161 to −133 bp) led to the formation of two major DNA-protein complexes, and the intensity increased markedly with nuclear extracts from cells treated with 200 μm MDA for 6–24 h (Fig.6A). Competition with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled FP3 oligonucleotide demonstrated the specificity of these complexes. To determine the identity of thetrans-acting factors involved in the formation of these DNA-protein complexes, competition and supershift assays were performed. Whereas a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide competed totally the formation of these complexes, the same molar excess of unlabeled NF-1 oligonucleotide failed to compete the formation of any of these complexes. Supershift assay using specific Sp1 antibody resulted in the formation of a supershifted band and in a decrease in the intensity of the upper band (Fig.6B). Likewise, inclusion of specific Sp3 antibody in the binding reaction led to the complete disappearance of the lower complex and the formation of a supershifted band. Finally, incubation of nuclear extracts and FP3 probe with both antisera, anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3, supershifted almost completely the two complexes. Inclusion of antisera against BTEB, NF-1, Zf9, or AP2 transcription factors in the binding reaction failed to supershift any band. Supershift assay using c-Krox antiserum led to the formation of a supershifted band. However, the intensity of this band decreased after incubation of cells with MDA (Fig. 6B). Western blot using specific polyclonal c-Krox antibody showed that MDA treatment did not induce any significant change in c-Krox protein content in HSC (Fig.7A).FIG. 7Treatment of HSC with MDA neither affects the cellular content in c-Krox protein nor the binding of nuclear factors to FP4. A, 25 μg of nuclear protein extracts from cells incubated in the absence (Ctr) or presence of 200 μm MDA for 24 h (MDA) and 0.45 μg of recombinant c-Krox protein (c-Krox) were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane for immunoblot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ponceau S staining was used to confirm equal loading. Immunoblot was then probed with specific antibodies against c-Krox protein and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. B, double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the FP4 (−190 to −170 bp) of the col1a1promoter was radiolabeled and incubated with 5 μg of nuclear protein extracts from untreated (C) or treated cells with 200 μm MDA (M) for 1–24 h. A 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled FP4 (F4) oligonucleotide was used as competitor (Comp.) in a competition assay. NE, nuclear extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By contrast with the results obtained with FP2 and FP3 oligonucleotides, gel retardation experiments with FP4 oligonucleotide containing sequence spanning nucleotides −190 to −170 of thecol1a1 promoter as a labeled probe also demonstrated two major complexes formed with nuclear extract from HSC. However, the pattern and the intensity of these complexes were not modified by the treatment of cells with 200 μm MDA for 1–24 h (Fig.7B). To assess the role of the FP2 and FP3 in the stimulation ofcol1a1 gene expression, we transfected HSC with plasmids containing mutations either at FP2 [p(−905ΔFP2)ColCAT] or at FP2 and FP3 [p(−905ΔFP2/ΔFP3)ColCAT] or no mutations [p(−905)ColCAT]. As Fig. 8Ashows, the stimulatory effect of MDA on p(−905)ColCAT expression disappeared in cells transfected with mutant constructs in which the Sp1/Sp3-binding sites in FP2 have been converted from GGGGGCCGGG into GGGAACCTGG and the Sp1/Sp3-binding sites in FP3 from CCCCCCTCTT into CCAAACTCTT. To determine whether the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the col1a1 promoter is involved in the mediation of the MDA-induced expression of the col1a1 gene, we pretreated HSC with 0.1 μm mithramycin for 2 h, a drug that interferes with the binding of transcription factors to G + C-rich promoters (33Blume S.W. Snyder R.C. Ray R. Thomas S. Koller C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These experiments confirmed not only that mithramycin reduced the binding of nuclear proteins to FP2 and FP3 oligonucleotides (Fig. 8B), but also that this drug decreased the basal col1a1 mRNA levels and abrogated the effect of MDA on col1a1 gene expression (Fig.8C). This drug was not toxic to HSC at the used concentration. Because these data suggested that the stimulatory effect of MDA was mediated through the binding of Sp proteins to the col1a1promoter, we wanted to determine whether this effect of MDA could be reproduced in other genes containing Sp1-binding sites. Therefore, we transiently transfected HSC using either pΔSLuc or p(−126)Luc reporter plasmids. Whereas addition of 200 μm MDA to HSC transfected with pΔSLuc, a deletion construct lacking Sp1-binding site, did not change significantly the expression of this gene, addition of the same amount of MDA to HSC transfected with p(−126)Luc, a plasmid containing two consensus Sp1-binding elements, resulted in a 3.7-fold increase in gene expression (Fig.9). To determine whether the increased binding of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins to the col1a1promoter induced by the MDA treatment was due to a change in the amount of these proteins in the cell extract, Western blot assays were performed. These assays showed that treatment of cells with 200 μm MDA increased 2- and 3-fold the cell content in Sp3 and Sp1 proteins, respectively (Fig.10A). Moreover, treatment of cells with 200 μm MDA increased the steady-state levels of Sp1 mRNA 4.8-fold. The maximal expression was reached by 3 h, but declined afterward (Fig. 10B). In the present study, we demonstrate that MDA stimulates significantly col1a1 gene expression in primary culture of confluent HSC in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig.1). These results concur with those reported by Tsukamoto and co-workers (5Tsukamoto H. Alcohol. 1993; 10: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Tsukamoto H. Rippe R.A. Niemela O. Lin M. J.

In accordance with these observations, activation of the Rac/p21-activated kinase (PAK) pathway, a crucial element in the regulation of cell spreading, is markedly enhanced in VASP(−/−) cells. Thus, in the absence of VASP Rac activation is dramatically prolonged, and PAK activity is elevated after stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor or serum, respectively.

Collectively, our results reveal a VASP-dependent modulation of the Rac/PAK pathway and Rac/PAK-regulated processes, like cell motility and polarization.

These proteins are involved in actin filament formation at the plasma membrane (4Drees B. Friederich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard D. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol.

Mechanistically, Ena/VASP proteins are thought to facilitate actin filament formation by recruiting polymerization competent profilin-actin complexes to zyxin, vinculin, the Listeria ActA protein, and other binding partners (3Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 243-249Google Scholar, 7Machesky L.M. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 542-543Google Scholar, 8Cameron L.A. Giardini P.A. Soo F.S. Theriot J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 110-119Google Scholar). A recent model (10Dickinson R.B. Purich D.L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 605-617Google Scholar) proposes that Ena/VASP family members may serve as clamps to link growing actin filaments to a motile surface during the process of filament elongation. They may also enable Arp2/3 complex independent actin polymerization (11Fradelizi J. Noireaux V. Plastino J. Menichi B. Louvard D. Sykes C. Golsteyn R.M. Friederich E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 699-707Google Scholar). However, increasing evidence is also emerging that implicates Ena/VASP proteins as crucial inhibitory factors in repulsive axon guidance (12Bashaw G.J. Kidd T. Murray D. Pawson T. Goodman C.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 703-715Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotide-dependent inhibition of platelet integrin function (13Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M.

Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fässler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying these seemingly contrary functions remained elusive (reviewed in Refs. 1Bear J.E. Krause M. Gertler F.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 158-166Google Scholar, 2Renfranz P.J. Beckerle M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 88-103Google Scholar, 3Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 243-249Google Scholar and 16Machesky L.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 685-688Google Scholar). Cell polarization, shape change, adhesion, spreading, and migration critically depend on a highly dynamic, coordinated, and tightly regulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Assembly of branched actin filament networks at the leading edge is directed by the stimulation of Arp2/3 complex by WASP/Scar family proteins in concert with their regulators Cdc42, polyphosphoinositides, WASP-interacting protein, SH3 domain proteins, and profilin (reviewed in Refs. 17Wear M.A. Schafer D.A. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R891-R895Google Scholar and18Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Google Scholar). The small GTPase Rac induces the formation of actin-driven lamellipodial protrusions that are associated with translational locomotion. On the molecular level, Rac activation promotes actin polymerization via a variety of effector proteins (for a review, see Refs. 19Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar and 20Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase and subsequent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent barbed end uncapping is followed by extension of existing actin filaments or those created by fragmentation. Rac is also linked to the WASP/Scar protein WAVE through its interaction with IRSp531 (21Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Google Scholar). IRSp53 is an adapter protein that binds via its SH3 domain containing C-terminal part also to Mena in a probably Cdc42-regulated fashion (22Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1645-1655Google Scholar). Other important mediators of various Rac effects are the p21-activated kinases (PAKs). They bind GTP-Rac at their CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) motif in an adhesion-dependent manner (23del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Google Scholar, 24del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Google Scholar). Moreover, PAKs can be activated by GTP-loaded Cdc42 and through a variety of pathways originating from growth factor receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors, and integrins (for a review, see Ref. 25Kjøller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Google Scholar). PAK regulates myosin light chain phosphorylation via myosin light chain kinase (26Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Google Scholar) and direct phosphorylation (27Zeng Q. Lagunoff D. Masaracchia R. Goeckeler Z. Cote G. Wysolmerski R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Google Scholar). In addition, PAK activates LIM kinase (LIMK) by phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the activation loop (28Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Google Scholar, 29Lawler S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R800-R802Google Scholar). When activated by PAK or Rho-associated protein kinase (29Lawler S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R800-R802Google Scholar), LIMK phosphorylates and inactivates actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin, which results in actin filament stabilization (reviewed in Refs. 28Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Google Scholar and30Chernoff J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E115-E117Google Scholar). Here, we show that in VASP-deficient murine fibroblasts the Rac/PAK pathway is activated, and cells are highly spread, despite normal expression of Mena and Evl. In addition, VASP-deficient cells show compromised motility and reorientation. Our results demonstrate an unexpected functional link between VASP and small GTP-binding proteins and help to resolve the apparently contrary effects of Ena/VASP proteins on actin-based motility. DMEM, antibiotics, and phosphate-buffered saline were from Invitrogen. Trypsin 2.5%, collagenase/dispase, hygromycin, and protease inhibitors (MiniComplete®) were from Roche Diagnostics, and CellStar® culture dishes were from Greiner. The following antibodies were used in this work: anti-VASP (M4) (Ref. 31Halbrügge M. Friedrich C. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbächer P. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3088-3093Google Scholar; immunoGlobe), anti-Mena (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Rac (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-PAK (N20 and Thr402, Santa Cruz). Pictures were taken with a digital camera using MetaMorph 4.1 software (Universal Imaging Corp.) in conjunction with an Axiovert 25 or Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss). For cell surface measurements, five different optical fields of each cell line were recorded and analyzed with Scion Image Software. The volume of suspended cells is given as an average of the volume that was calculated with a CASY®1 cell counter (Schärfe System) at passages 1–40. Northern blots (Formaldehyde-Based System Northern MaxTM; Ambion) were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfer, nylon membranes were cross-linked (Stratalink, Stratagene), prehybridized with DIG Easy Hybridization Buffer (Roche Diagnostics) at 50 °C for 30 min, and hybridized overnight at 50 °C with 5 μl of probe in 10 ml of DIG Easy Hybridization Buffer. Probes for Evl and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the following primers: 5′-GAGCAGCAGCACCGCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGACAGCAACGAGGACACAGG-3′ for Evl (product: 590 bp) and 5′-TTAGCACCCCTGGCCAAGG-3′ and 5′CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (product: 540 bp). The reverse transcriptase-PCR product was used as a template for a PCR with DIG-labeled dNTPs (Roche Diagnostics) and the same primers. Membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-sodium citrate, pH 7) at room temperature for 5 min and twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 68 °C. The DIG Detection System (Roche Diagnostics) was used for detection. Murine cardiac fibroblasts were prepared from knock-out and wild type strains (14Hauser W. Knobeloch K.P. Eigenthaler M. Gambaryan S. Krenn V. Geiger J. Glazova M. Rohde E. Horak I. Walter U. Zimmer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8120-8125Google Scholar) essentially as decribed previously (32Simm A. Nestler M. Hoppe V. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 357-368Google Scholar). Two 3-month-old mice from each strain were treated with 100 mg/kg ketamin, 10 mg/kg xylacin, and 1 ml/kg heparin. The hearts were excised, submerged in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cut into pieces with a tissue chopper. The pieces were washed with Earl buffer, and cells were dissociated with 1 mg/ml collagenase/dispase. After 30 min at 37 °C tissue pieces that had sedimented were discarded, and the supernatant, containing the isolated cells, was centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in DMEM, 10% calf serum, and transferred to a 25-cm2 culture flask. Every 3 days, the cells were trypsinized (0.1% trypsin), counted (CASY®1 cell counter, Schärfe System), and transferred to a new flask at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2. After 3–4 weeks in culture, the isolated cells were spontaneously immortalized. Mesangial cells were prepared essentially as described previously (33Gambaryan S. Hauser W. Kobsar A. Glazova M. Walter U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 535-543Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in Laemmli SDS-sample buffer, and proteins were precipitated with chloroform/methanol as described previously (34Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using the Protean® IEF cell from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer's instructions. 100 μg of protein were solubilized in 350 μl of lysis buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Bio-Lyte 3/10 Ampholyte (pH range 3–10), and 10 nm okadaic acid. Cell extracts were loaded on a 17-cm ReadyStrip IPG strip (linear pH range 3–10) (Bio-Rad) during 16–24 h active rehydration at 50 V. Focusing was for 30 min at 250 V, 30 min at 500 V, followed by a linear increase to 4000 V within 5 h, and a final step at 4000 V for 16 h. After equilibration in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 6m urea, 30% glycerol, and 2% SDS, the strips were immediately applied to vertical SDS gels (10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide). Gels were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and PAK1 was detected by immunoblotting with N20 antibody (Santa Cruz). Using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) VASP(−/−) cells were transfected with pCDM8(Hygro)-VASP (provided by Dr. M. Eigenthaler), i.e.full-length human VASP cDNA cloned into the pCDM8(Hygro) vector (Invitrogen). One day after transfection, cells were exposed to the selective medium (50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Diagnostics) in DMEM with 10% calf serum). Transfected cells were routinely maintained in selective medium, whereas experiments were conducted in the same medium without hygromycin B. Activated Rac was determined as described previously (35Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were starved for 24 h with serum-free DMEM and stimulated with 5 ng/ml of PDGF-BB (Sigma) (36Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Google Scholar) for the times indicated. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 2-fold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). After lysis for 15 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at full speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and 50 μl of the supernatant was used to estimate the total amount of Rac. The rest of the supernatant was mixed with ∼20 μg of the Rac-GTP binding domain of PAK as a GST fusion protein (GST-PBD, a kind gift of Dr. Bockoch, La Jolla, CA) for 45 min at 4 °C. Then the samples were centrifuged at 320 × g at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Finally, the pelleted beads were resuspended in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE using an anti-Rac antibody (Upstate-Biomol). As controls, unstimulated cells were lysed and clarified as described above. 0.1 volume of 150 mm EDTA was added to the samples, immediately followed by an addition of 200 μm GTPγS to the positive control or 1 mm GDP to the negative control. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Then reactions were stopped by addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 60 mm and transfer to 4 °C. The samples were then incubated with the GST-PBD construct coupled to GSH-Sepharose beads, washed, and analyzed as described above. The pulled down material and aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed to check for the efficiency of the method. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips or in 25-cm2 culture flasks and were grown until confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. The monolayer was scratched with a sterile pipette tip. Pictures were taken directly after scratching and 15 h later. In some experiments, cells were recorded by time-lapse video microscopy. To elucidate the cellular role of VASP, mouse cardiac fibroblast cell lines (MCFB) were established from both VASP(+/+) and VASP(−/−) mice. As judged from immunoblotting or Northern blotting, the absence of VASP did not affect the expression level of Mena and Evl, two other Ena/VASP family members (Fig. 1). This is in accordance with data on Mena and Evl expression in other VASP(−/−) tissues (13Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M. Zhou X.H. Ny L. Andersson K.E. Kehrel B. Offermanns S. Fässler R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 37-48Google Scholar, 14Hauser W. Knobeloch K.P. Eigenthaler M. Gambaryan S. Krenn V. Geiger J. Glazova M. Rohde E. Horak I. Walter U. Zimmer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8120-8125Google Scholar). Evl expression appeares to be very low both in mouse cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B) and total mouse heart (13Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M. Zhou X.H. Ny L. Andersson K.E. Kehrel B. Offermanns S. Fässler R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 37-48Google Scholar, 14Hauser W. Knobeloch K.P. Eigenthaler M. Gambaryan S. Krenn V. Geiger J. Glazova M. Rohde E. Horak I. Walter U. Zimmer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8120-8125Google Scholar). Phenotypically, VASP(−/−) cells exhibit larger lamellipodia and are more spread in comparison with wild type cells (Fig.2, A and B). Analysis of the substrate surface area covered by adherent cells revealed that VASP(−/−) cells (2.61 ± 0.90 arbitrary units) were more than twice the size of VASP(+/+) cells (1.00 ± 0.45). However, the cell volumes were similar in both cell lines (Fig.2 D), indicating that the bigger size of adherent knock-out cells is due to an increased spreading state. This difference is independent of the cell density, leading to reduced cell numbers at confluence (Fig. 2 F). Results were reproducible until passage number 40. In addition, primary cardiac fibroblasts and several independently isolated clones of each cell line showed similar results (data not shown). Equivalent results were obtained with primary mesangial cells from both mouse strains; VASP(−/−) mesangial cells were also characterized by enhanced spreading and lamellipodia formation in comparison to wild type cells (Fig.3, A and B), and consequently lower cell densities at confluence (Fig.3 C).Figure 3Cell shape difference in mouse mesangial cells. A and B, phase contrast micrographs of VASP(+/+) (A) and VASP(−/−) (B) mesangial cells. C, relative number of cells at confluence. Data are shown as percentage with the number of VASP(+/+) cells set as 100%. (n = 28 confluent dishes for VASP(+/+);n = 32 confluent dishes for VASP(−/−)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These data confirm that the phenotype observed is neither due to clonal artifacts, nor is it restricted to a single cell type only. To verify that increased spreading of VASP(−/−) cells was indeed due to the absence of VASP, we stably transfected wild type human VASP into MCFB VASP(−/−) cells (RecVASP cells). The average VASP expression level of RecVASP cells was similar to wild type cells (Fig. 1 A). Both, with respect to the cell morphology and cell area, RecVASP cells behaved like wild type cells (Fig. 2, C–F). Individual clones isolated from these RecVASP cells showed gradually decreased propensities of lamellipodia formation, which paralleled increasing levels of VASP expression (Fig. 4). Therefore, we conclude that VASP expression down-regulates excessive cell spreading. Since Rac, Cdc42, and PAK are key regulators of lamellipodia formation and cell spreading (19Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar, 20Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Google Scholar, 37Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Google Scholar, 40Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Google Scholar), we analyzed this pathway in VASP(−/−) cells. To investigate Rac activation we used a Rac pull-down assay. A GST fusion of the Rac/Cdc42 binding (CRIB) motif of PAK was used to affinity precipitate the activated form of Rac (Rac-GTP) (35Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar, 41Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, PDGF-BB (5 ng/ml) induced a rapid and transient activation of Rac in VASP(+/+) cells with a maximal activity at around 2 min. After 5 min of stimulation Rac activity decreased again and reached background levels at about 10–15 min. Interestingly, Rac activation in VASP(−/−) cells was significantly faster as compared with VASP(+/+) cells. The maximal degree of Rac activation was seen after 1 min of stimulation and was maintained at a high level for at least 15 min (Fig. 5, upper panels). If prolonged Rac activation were specifically due to VASP deficiency, it should be possible to reverse this effect by reintroducing VASP into VASP(−/−) cells. Indeed, reconstituted cells were characterized by a transient PDGF-induced Rac activation, comparable with VASP(+/+) cells (Fig. 5). RecVASP cells showed a maximal Rac activation at around 1 min after stimulation, which within 1 additional min returned to levels of unstimulated controls or even below. All these cell lines expressed similar amounts of Rac, confirming that we observed an enhanced activation of the small GTPase rather than increased expression levels of the protein. These data, together with the morphological differences described above, strongly suggest that VASP is involved in the regulation of Rac activity. PAK appears to be a central element in pathways that lead to cell spreading, since it functions both as a direct target of activated Rac and Cdc42 and as an upstream activator of Rac (42Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. Yen S.C. Hall C. Lim L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess activation of this signaling pathway in more detail in MCFB cells, we also analyzed PAK activation. Upon interaction with their activators, PAKs undergo autophosphorylation at multiple sites (43Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Google Scholar). One of these sites, which is involved in substrate recognition (43Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Google Scholar), is fully conserved in PAK-1 to PAK-3 and is centered around Thr423 (human PAK-1; α-PAK), Thr402 (PAK-2; γ-PAK), and Thr421(PAK-3; β-PAK), respectively. Analysis using an antibody directed against this phosphorylated autophosphorylation site showed that wild type cells displayed a transient PAK phosphorylation ceasing within about 5 min of fetal calf serum stimulation, whereas a profound and more sustained elevation of phospho-PAK was observed with VASP (−/−) MCFB (Fig.6 A). In another approach, VASP(−/−) and wild type cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Cell lysates were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and were immunoblotted using an anti-PAK antibody that recognizes PAK-1 independent of its phosphorylation state. After serum stimulation for 2 h, PAK-1 from VASP-deficient cells, as compared with VASP(+/+) cells, showed a much more pronounced shift to a lower isoelectric point, indicating PAK-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). In conclusion, not only morphological data, but also two lines of biochemical evidence, indicate that the Rac/PAK pathway is activated in MCFB cells in the absence of VASP. The Rac/PAK pathway is known to play an essential role in cell motility (19Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar, 20Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Google Scholar, 38Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Google Scholar, 39Nobes C.D. Hall A. J.

Therefore, we tested whether cell motility of VASP-deficient cells was affected in a wound healing assay. To this end, cells were scratched off of a confluent cell layer to allow cells next to the scratch area to migrate into the empty space. Pictures of the cells were taken immediately after scratching (Fig.7, A–C) and 15 h later (Fig. 7, D–F). Twelve to 15 h after scratching, VASP(+/+) cells in the outermost cell row were mostly orientated parallel to the wound (Fig. 7, D andD′), whereas VASP(−/−) cells after 15 h were perpendicular to the wound (Fig. 7, E and E′). This obvious difference in the orientation of the cells could be reverted by reintroducing VASP into VASP(−/−) cells (Fig. 7,F and F′). The orientation of stress fibers coincided with that of the cells (data not shown). Using time-lapse microscopy, the wound healing assay was analyzed in more detail over a period of 24 h. Whereas all three cell lines were able to close the scratch within about 20 to 22 h, the motility of the cells was different. Twelve to 15 h after scratching, VASP(+/+) cells started to detach from their neighbors in the monolayer and were migrating with highly active frontal lamellipodia and retraction of their rear ends, resulting in an orientation parallel to the scratch. In contrast, VASP(−/−) cells were protruding highly mobile lamellipodia into the direction of the wound without retracting at their rear ends from the adjacent cell monolayer. Overall this resulted in a more perpendicular orientation relative to the scratch. Ultimately, dividing cells considerably contributed to wound closure. RecVASP cells behaved as wild type cells, indicating that the reduced translocational speed of VASP(−/−) cells was indeed due to the lack of VASP. In conclusion, the capability of VASP(−/−) cells to reorient their stress fibers and cell axis and to detach their rear ends appears to be markedly compromised when compared with VASP expressing cells. Together, this results in decreased cell motility. The absence of VASP expression leads to increased cell spreading, a characteristic feature of Rac/PAK pathway activation (19Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar,38Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Google Scholar, 39Nobes C.D. Hall A. J.

Moreover, we have shown that Rac and PAK are activated in VASP(−/−) cells, as demonstrated by Rac GTP-binding (35Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar, 41Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47906-47913Google Scholar) and PAK phosphorylation (43Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Google Scholar), respectively. This suggests a VASP-dependent inhibition of this pathway in wild type cells. In accordance with this interpretation, both cell spreading (Figs. 2 and 4) and prolonged Rac activation (Fig. 5) could be reverted by expression of human VASP in VASP(−/−) mouse cardiac fibroblasts. Importantly, VASP expression levels, which could restore normal cell behavior, were somewhat lower than VASP expression in wild type cells. That is, they were within the physiological range. Further gradual decreases in VASP expression levels visibly led to more pronounced spreading phenotypes. These effects were observed despite the expression of considerable amounts of Mena protein and low levels of Evl, as judged from immunoblotting and Northern blotting experiments, respectively.

Regulation by heterotrimeric G proteins has been the hallmark of adenylyl cyclase activity, but the details of this regulation have remained unclear until recently. In vitro, Gαi can inhibit both Gαs and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities in a non-competitive manner (7Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hildebrandt J.D. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13178-13185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But much of our recent knowledge is based upon experiments utilizing the cytoplasmic (or soluble) domains of adenylyl cyclase. The two cytoplasmic domains of adenylyl cyclase (C1 and C2) create a pseudosymmetrical heterodimer that forms the catalytic moiety of the enzyme and is the target for most known intracellular regulators (reviewed in Ref. 14Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains contain a 200–250 amino acid region that is ∼50% similar to each other and 50–90% similar to corresponding regions of other adenylyl cyclase isoforms. The C1 and C2 domains can be independently expressed as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli and mixed to reconstitute full adenylyl cyclase activity, including activation by Gαs and forskolin and inhibition by P-site inhibitors and Gαi (15Whisnant R.E.

These soluble adenylyl cyclase fragments have proven invaluable in determining the stoichiometry of Gαs, forskolin, and ATP binding. They have also proven invaluable in localizing binding sites for Gαs and Gαi and in discerning the catalytic mechanism of P-site inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Much of this early work utilized C1 and C2 proteins from dissimilar isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (C1 from type I and the C2 domain from type II adenylyl cyclase), although more recent systems contain both domains from a single adenylyl cyclase isoform (19Dessauer C.W.

Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and binding studies indicate that Gαi binds to this corresponding site in the C1 domain (19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism for Gαi-mediated inhibition is still unclear. Activation of adenylyl cyclase by Gαs or forskolin results in a 100-fold increase in the apparent affinity of the two domains for one another (15Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl.

We show herein that Gαi works in opposition to Gαs to reduce domain interaction and thus the formation of the adenylyl cyclase catalytic site. Membranes were prepared from Sf9 cells expressing type V adenylyl cyclase. Cells (2 × 106/ml) were infected with baculovirus (1 plaque-forming unit/cell), harvested after 48 h, and lysed by nitrogen cavitation. After removal of nuclei, membranes were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 200 mm sucrose. All G protein α-subunits were synthesized in E. coli as described by Lee et al.(27Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).

Purified α-subunits were activated by incubation with 50 mm NaHEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 400 μm [35S]GTPγS at 30 °C for 30 min for Gαs or 2 h for Gαi. Free GTPγS was removed by gel filtration. All G proteins were activated with GTPγS unless stated otherwise. The C2 domains of type II and type V adenylyl cyclase (IIC2, VC2) and the C1 and C1a domains of type V adenylyl cyclase were expressed inE. coli and purified by metal affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange as described previously (15Whisnant R.E.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All assays were performed for 7–10 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 50–100 μl with 5 mmMgCl2 and 100 μm ATP for the membrane-bound enzyme. In assays containing C1 and C2 domain proteins (reconstitution assays), limiting concentrations of the C1 domain protein were first incubated with Gαi for 15 min on ice followed by addition of Gαs and VC2 prior to initiation of the assay. The final concentration of C2 was at least 0.5 μm to promote interaction between the C1 and C2 proteins except where indicated otherwise. The final concentration of ATP was 1 mm for reconstitution assays, unless stated otherwise. All determinations were performed in duplicate and are representative of at least two experiments. Proteins (100-μl sample volumes) were applied to a Superdex 200 column (HR10/30; Amersham Biosciences). Samples were eluted with 20 mm NaHEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 15 μm forskolin, and 100 mm NaCl. The first 7 ml were collected in a single fraction; 200-μl fractions were collected thereafter. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. Binding of Ap(CH2)pp by equilibrium dialysis was performed as described in Ref. 18Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. Filter binding was performed using HA, 0.45-μm cellulose ester plates on a 96-well vacuum manifold unit (Millipore). Reactions contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2–20 μm[3H]Ap(CH2)pp, and VC1a (10 μm), IIC2 (10 μm), and GTPγS-Gαs (15 μm) in the presence or absence of 15 μm GTPγS-Gαi in a final volume of 25 μl. G protein subunits were activated in the absence of radiolabeled GTPγS. The reactions were incubated for 10 min on ice, then rapidly filtered on prerinsed HA membranes and washed twice with 200 μl of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl). Filter membranes were dried in a vacuum desiccator, and the bound ligand was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. We have previously shown that Gαi binds within the cleft formed by the α2 and α3 helices of the C1a domain of type V adenylyl cyclase. Using [35S]GTPγS-Gαi a clear shift in molecular weight of Gαi is observed upon addition of the C1a domain as determined by gel filtration. However, the tight binding of the C1a domain and Gαi is partially disrupted by formation of a C1-C2complex in the presence of forskolin (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, the complex of C1a and Gαi is completely abolished in the presence of both Gαs and forskolin. Gαsdoes not compete for binding of Gαi to the C1domain; however, full activation of adenylyl cyclase by Gαs and forskolin does limit the extent of inhibition by Gαi (7Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined the formation of a potential Gαi-C1-C2-Gαscomplex in the absence of forskolin (Fig. 1 B) using the full-length C1 domain, which has a 10-fold higher affinity for Gαi (19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Even in the presence of high concentrations of C1, C2, Gαs, and Gαi, complexes between C1-Gαiand C2-Gαs are formed, but no heterotetramer is ever observed. Note that myristoylated Gαi and complexes containing the myristoylated protein tend to be slightly retarded on gel filtration columns most likely because of the hydrophobic nature of the myristate group. Both forskolin and Gαs have been shown to increase the affinity of C1 and C2 by 100-fold more than basal, and the combined action of the activators increases the apparent affinity of C1 and C2 by more than 1000-fold. Our gel filtration results suggest that Gαi may work in opposition to these regulators to decrease the affinity between C1 and C2. We therefore examined the ability of Gαi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase with increasing concentrations of C2 protein to drive the interaction between the two domains (Fig.2 A). At low concentrations of C2, Gαi greatly inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity. However, as the concentration of C2 increases, the interaction between C1 and C2 increases, reducing the ability of Gαi to inhibit the enzyme. At maximal concentrations of C2 protein, no inhibition by Gαi is observed. Therefore, the interaction between the C1 and C2 domains not only decreases the binding of Gαi to C1 but also decreases the ability of Gαi to inhibit the enzyme. A similar phenomenon is observed with a mutant of C1 (E418A), which has a 6-fold higher affinity for Gαi (19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Once again, maximal inhibition occurs at low C2 concentrations, and the effect of Gαi decreases with increasing C2(Fig. 2 B). In this case, however, the effect of Gαi is not eliminated at maximal concentrations of C2. This mutation is within the Gαi binding cleft and has no effect on the apparent affinity of the C1and C2 domains (Fig. 2 C) and does not increase dimerization of C1 as measured by gel filtration (data not shown). The inability to eliminate the effect of Gαi at high C2 concentrations is most likely caused by the increased efficacy of Gαi-mediated inhibition of both the membrane-bound and cytoplasmic domains of adenylyl cyclase when this mutation is present (19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the mutation of Glu-418 to alanine induces a conformational change that facilitates Gαi inhibition independent of changes at the C1-C2 interface. We have also examined the interaction between the C1 and C2 domains utilizing a mutant within the C2domain (K1014N in type II AC) with an increased affinity between the C1a and C2 domains in the presence and absence of Gαs (30Hatley M.E. Benton B.K. Xu J. Manfredi J.P. Gilman A.G. Sunahara R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38626-38632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When paired with the full-length C1 domain from type V, the C2-K1014N mutant shows a similar 10-fold shift in affinity for C1 (Fig.3 A). This point mutant is located 16–28 Å from Gαi-interacting residues and on the opposite domain from which Gαi binds. Thus it is not predicted to directly interfere with Gαi binding. However, the inhibition of C1 and the mutant C2domain by Gαi is remarkably diminished as compared with wild type (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, once again as the affinity of C1 and C2 is increased, the ability of Gαi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase is decreased. The Gαi binding cleft is located in close proximity to the catalytic site, particularly to residues contacting the magnesium ions at the active site and the phosphate moieties of substrate or P-site molecules. Therefore, Gαi may affect binding of molecules to the active site. To address this possibility, kinetic analysis of inhibition by Gαi and P-site inhibitors or substrate analogs was performed. P-site inhibitors bind at the active site and are postulated to mimic a product-like transition state. Classic P-site inhibitors (such as 2′d3′-AMP) require the product pyrophosphate for binding to the enzyme and show uncompetitive inhibition with respect to MgATP upon activation with Gαs(18Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The P-site inhibitor 2′d3′-AMP and Gαi behave as mutually exclusive inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase giving rise to a family of parallel lines on a Dixon plot obtained at different Gαi concentrations (Fig.4 A). This kinetic pattern is true for both the recombinant membrane-bound enzyme and the cytoplasmic domains of type V adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 4 B). Therefore any complex of adenylyl cyclase containing Gαi has significantly reduced ability to obtain a conformation capable of binding this type of transition state analog. This same pattern of inhibition is also observed for the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase with the more potent P-site inhibitor, 2′5′dd3′-ATP (data not shown) (31Desaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is an important feature of catalysis because product release is one of the rate-limiting steps along the reaction coordinate for adenylyl cyclase (18Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ap(CH2)pp is a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP that competitively competes for ATP binding (18Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in the Dixon plot for the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase (Fig.5 A), Ap(CH2)pp also shows a nearly parallel family of curves obtained at different Gαi concentrations with respect to Ap(CH2)pp, indicating that each of these two inhibitors binds with greatly reduced affinity in the presence of the other. The intersection of these lines well below the x axis provides a reduction in the K i for Ap(CH2)pp of at least 6-fold in the presence of Gαi. However, the cytoplasmic domains of type V show an intersection of lines on thex axis, suggesting no significant reduction in the affinity of the enzyme for Ap(CH2)pp in the presence of Gαi (Fig. 5 B). This non-competitive interaction is consistent with the formation of a Gαi-C1-C2-ATP complex. To further understand the binding of Ap(CH2)pp to the cytoplasmic domains of adenylyl cyclase, we measured the direct binding of Ap(CH2)pp to C1, C2, and Gαs in the presence or absence of Gαi. These measurements were made using Mn2+, which greatly increases the affinity of adenylyl cyclase for Ap(CH2)pp as compared to Mg2+ (18Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An identical pattern of non-competitive inhibition was obtained for the soluble type V domains with Ap(CH2)pp and Gαi in the presence of Mn2+ as previously shown for Mg2+ (Fig.6). Gαs is required to form a complex at reasonable concentrations of C1 and C2, but Gαs will reduce the effectiveness of Gαi in this assay by reducing the binding of Gαi to the C1 domain. Therefore a complete loss of binding is not anticipated, but clearly a 50% reduction in Ap(CH2)pp is observed by both filter binding assays (Fig.6 B) and equilibrium dialysis (data not shown). Scatchard plot analysis of the filter binding data would suggest non-competitive binding of Ap(CH2)pp, although we were unable to fully saturate binding. One unusual aspect of Gαi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is the inability of Gαi to inhibit the membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase in the presence of manganese. This has been reported previously by Hildebrandt and Birnbaumer (32Hildebrandt J.D. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13141-13147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it was unclear at that time if this was caused by an effect of Mn2+ on the G protein or catalytic subunit. We show that Gαi is unable to inhibit type V adenylyl cyclase in the presence of Mn2+ alone, Mn2+ and Gαs, or Mn2+ and forskolin (Fig.7 A). In fact, Gαi actually increases forskolin-stimulated activity in the presence of Mn2+. This may be due to the weak ability of Gαi to compete at the Gαs binding site (7Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of Gαi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase in the presence of Mn2+ is not caused by an inactivation of Gαi, since Gαi can inhibit the Mn2+-Gαs-stimulated cytoplasmic domains of adenylyl cyclase activity under identical conditions (Fig.6 A). In addition to 3 mm Mn2+, these assays all contain 0.5 mm Mg2+, which should be sufficient to maintain activation of the G proteins. The inclusion of an additional 1 mm Mg2+ has no effect on the membrane-bound enzyme in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig.7 B). The mechanism for this effect of metals on Gαi-mediated inhibition and the difference between the soluble and membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase is discussed below. Preliminary kinetic analysis suggests that Gαs and Gαi bind simultaneously to adenylyl cyclase; however, a complex of C1-C2-Gαs-Gαi has not been observed (7Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This suggests a model in which Gαi inhibits the enzyme by decreasing the affinity of one domain for another. This is in stark contrast to Gαs and forskolin stimulation where the affinity between C1 and C2 increases with increased activation. We show that binding of Gαi to the C1 domain is weakened or lost in the presence of a C1-C2-forskolin or a C1-C2-Gαs-forskolin complex (Fig. 1). However, Gαi inhibits the fully stimulated Gαs-forskolin-activated enzyme very poorly, and we would not expect to observe a complex with both Gαs and Gαi under these conditions. Therefore, we also examined whether a heterotetrameric complex could be formed with Gαi, Gαs, and adenylyl cyclase in the absence of forskolin. Even under conditions of high protein concentrations, a complex of C1-C2-Gαs-Gαi is never observed. A direct test of our hypothesis is the measurement of C1/C2 affinity in the presence of Gαi. It is clear that increased C1-C2 complex formation, driven by increasing C2 concentrations, decreases the ability of Gαi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the limited ability of Gαi to inhibit the most stimulated forms of adenylyl cyclase that display the highest C1/C2 affinity (7Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In fact, a mutant C2 protein (K1014N, Ref. 30Hatley M.E. Benton B.K. Xu J. Manfredi J.P. Gilman A.G. Sunahara R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38626-38632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with increased affinity for C1 displays dramatically decreased inhibition by Gαi (Fig. 3). Although the membrane spans of adenylyl cyclase physically link C1 and C2 in close proximity, the structural changes that we measure through a change in affinity are still occurring in the native enzyme. Supporting a structural change at the interface of C1/C2 is the fact that residues on one face of helix α2 interact with Gαi, whereas residues on the opposite face of α2 interact with the C2 domain (19Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). A conformational change at the C1/C2 interface and the close proximity of the Gαi binding site to the catalytic site might also suggest that Gαi influences the binding of molecules to the active site of adenylyl cyclase. Kinetic analysis of inhibition by P-site inhibitors and Gαireveals that the actions of these inhibitors are mutually exclusive. Therefore, binding of Gαi prevents formation of specific conformations at the active site, particularly those capable of binding these transition state analogs. This is true for both the soluble and membrane-bound enzymes, and this pattern of inhibition is observed with both uncompetitive (2′d3′-AMP) and non-competitive (2′5′dd3′-ATP) types of P-site inhibitors. It is clear that the key to regulation of adenylyl cyclase is the conformational state of the C1/C2 domain interface. The change in affinity is a measurement of the changes in conformation at the active site located at the domain interface. This type of movement is mimicked somewhat with P-site inhibitors. Even with bound Gαs and forskolin, the unliganded active site maintains an open conformation. But upon addition of P-site inhibitors that mimic a product-like transition state, the active site clamps down on the inhibitor as one might observe in an induced fit model of regulation (33Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 205-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the absence of activator, it is speculated that an even more open active site would be observed, similar to the structure obtained for the C2 homodimer (34Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This open to closed transition involves the inward collapse of structural elements around the active site. The Gαi binding site is directly adjacent to these regions and may affect binding of molecules to the catalytic site. In fact, the most flexible regions of the C1 domain are located on the back side of the Gαi binding site. We put forth evidence that Gαi mediates its effects by reducing the ability of the enzyme to obtain a closed conformation. This is observed as a reduced affinity between the C1 and C2 domain and a reduced ability to form a transition state conformation necessary for binding P-site inhibitors relative to the ground state. The kinetic analysis of inhibition by the substrate analog Ap(CH2)pp reveals a different pattern. Kinetic and binding data of the soluble domains and the membrane-bound enzyme show non-competitive aspects between Gαi and the substrate analog Ap(CH2)pp, as displayed by intersecting lines on a Dixon plot. However, the soluble domains have no reduction in theK i for Ap(CH2)pp in the presence of Gαi, while the membrane-bound enzyme displays a reduced affinity for Ap(CH2)pp and Gαi in the presence of each other. Despite this difference, clearly both Gαi and a substrate analog can bind simultaneously to adenylyl cyclase. However, it is not clear whether a Gαi-ATP-bound enzyme can lead to cAMP production. Gαi binding may allow limited binding of substrate to an inactive enzyme. Alternatively, Gαi binding may produce a catalytically competent enzyme but with greatly reduced activity. The latter rationale might explain why Gαi inhibition of either the soluble domains or membrane-bound type V AC never leads to zero or basal activity levels. Generally, the maximal inhibition by Gαi is 50–70% when stimulated with modest levels of Gαs (7Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that an AC-Gαi complex might retain low activity and hence bind substrate. Additional experiments are required to differentiate between these two possibilities. The effects observed with manganese may also point to an inability of Gαi to interact with a closed conformation. Residues from both C1 and C2 domains are required for binding ATP and ATP analogs (23Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 35Tang W.-J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In fact, P-site analogs bound at the active site can stabilize complex formation between C1 and C2 (30Hatley M.E. Benton B.K. Xu J. Manfredi J.P. Gilman A.G. Sunahara R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38626-38632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Manganese acts to increase the affinity of adenylyl cyclase for ATP analogs. This is observed as a 22-fold decrease in the K d for Ap(CH2)pp and a 2.5-fold decrease in the K m for ATP with the Gαs-stimulated cytoplasmic domains of type V adenylyl cyclase in the presence of Mn2+ versusMg2+ (36Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The difference between Mn2+ and Mg2+ is even more dramatic for the basal or forskolin-stimulated soluble enzyme (36Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is also present in the membrane-bound enzyme yielding a 4–7-fold reduction in the K m for ATP in the presence of Mn2+(37Garbers D.L. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8449-8456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 5-fold reduction in the K i for competitive ATP analogs (38Westcott K.R. Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 225: 8767-8771Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We measure a 30-fold reduction in the IC50 for Ap(CH2)pp in the presence of 100 μm ATP and manganese versus magnesium (data not shown). A similar reduction in K i is observed in the presence of manganese for all P-site analogs; however, the mechanism of this reduction may be due to the increase in activity of the enzyme rather than the increase in P-site affinity (18Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Londos C. Preston M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5951-5956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By increasing the affinity of metal-ATP for the enzyme, manganese may be serving to increase the interaction between C1 and C2, driving the enzyme to a more closed conformation. The question is why is this observed only for the membrane-bound enzyme. The soluble enzyme may be more susceptible to Gαiinhibition because of its very nature of two separate proteins. The membrane-bound enzyme holds the C1/C2 domains in the optimal orientation for catalysis. AlthoughV max is comparable to the soluble domains, theK m for metal-ATP and the affinity for ATP analogs are considerably lower for the membrane-bound enzyme (∼13-fold difference in the K m for Mg-ATP, data not shown). This may be part of the reason that Gαi reduces the affinity of Ap(CH2)pp for the membrane-bound enzyme and not for the soluble domain. The increased affinity for metal-ATP, particularly Mn-ATP, may reflect an inability of Gαi to inhibit this enzyme as compared with the C1/C2domains that have substantially weaker affinity for substrate. For the C1/C2 domains an increase in affinity for Mn-ATP is not sufficient to significantly reduce the inhibition by Gαi. As with all model systems, the cytoplasmic domains have been an invaluable tool but may have their limits in faithfully reproducing the kinetic features of adenylyl cyclase. In summary, these data suggest a model where Gαidecreases the interaction of C1 and C2 for each other and also decreases catalytic activity by decreasing the formation of the active site. This is directly opposite to the actions of Gαs and highlight the pseudosymmetry of the adenylyl cyclase structure that is poised for bidirectional regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1981322684,"We report the effect of partial delipidation and monomerization on the protein conformational changes of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) as a function of temperature. Removal of up to 75% of the lipids is known to have the lattice structure of the purple membrane, albeit as a smaller unit cell, whereas treatment by Triton monomerizes bR into micelles. The effects of these modifications on the protein secondary structure is analyzed by monitoring the protein amide I and amide II bands in the Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra. It is found that removal of the first 75% of the lipids has only a slight effect on the secondary structure at physiological temperature, whereas monomerizing bR into micelles alters the secondary structure considerably. Upon heating, the bR monomer is found to have a very low thermal stability compared with the native bR with its melting point reduced from 97 to 65 degrees C, and the pre-melting transition in which the protein changes conformation in native bR at 80 degrees C could not be observed. Also, the N[bond]H to N[bond]D exchange of the amide II band is effectively complete at room temperature, suggesting that there are no hydrophobic regions that are protected from the aqueous medium, possibly explaining the low thermal stability of the monomer. On the other hand, 75% delipidated bR has its melting temperature close to that of the native bR and does have a pre-melting transition, although the pre-melting transition occurs at significantly higher temperature than that of the native bR (91 degrees C compared with 80 degrees C) and is still reversible. Furthermore, we have also observed that the reversibility of this pre-melting transition of both native and partially delipidated bR is time-dependent and becomes irreversible upon holding at 91 degrees C between 10 and 30 min. These results are discussed in terms of the lipid and lattice contribution to the protein thermal stability of native bR."

As a model to study such systems, we have focused our attention on theSaccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor pheromone receptor Ste2p, which belongs to the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor family. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 represent a widely distributed family of membrane proteins, ranging in size from 400 to 1000 amino acid residues in a heptahelical topological arrangement that mediates cellular responses to a variety of extracellular signals, such as light, ions, hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and odorants. GPCRs are believed to exist in several interchangeable conformations including resting and active states (5Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E133-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The most widely accepted model to account for hormone action involves stabilization of the active (activated) conformation of the receptor as an outcome of ligand binding (6Kenakin T.

The transition into the active conformation results in changes in the physical state of the associated heterotrimeric G protein thereby activating diverse pathways such as protein kinases, adenylate cyclases, phospholipases, and ion channels and culminating in differential gene transcription and characteristic phenotypic changes in cellular physiology (8Dohlman H.G.

Given the overall common structural features among GPCRs, a detailed structural analysis using x-ray crystallography should bring insights into determinants of ligand binding and mechanisms of receptor activation. However, because of inherent difficulties in solubilizing and obtaining well diffracting crystals of the large, membrane-bound, lipid-associated GPCRs, such studies have been severely impeded. A noted exception is rhodopsin for which a high-resolution crystallographic structure has been determined (17Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I.

An alternative to detailed crystallographic information on GPCRs has been the analysis of mutant receptors for structure-function studies. One area of intense study has been to determine the ligand-binding site as a means to understanding different states of receptors and how the occupation by ligand may initiate signal transduction. Detailed analysis of GPCRs has suggested that for larger ligands, such as glycoproteins and peptide hormones, extracellular domains contribute binding determinants (19Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin.

Involvement of extracellular loops in ligand binding has been demonstrated directly by labeling of loops with photoaffinity peptide probes (37Behar V. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M.

The NH2 terminus of secretin receptor and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 were found to play an important role in interaction with ligand (40Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M.

Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3804-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Piserchio A. Bisello A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Mierke D.F.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, GPCRs have been identified in which large chimeric replacements of extracellular regions have caused dissociation of high affinity binding from receptor activation (24Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A number of experiments have attempted to identify Ste2p residues or regions involved in ligand binding. Chimeric receptors between the closely related S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces kluyveri α-factor receptors implicated the involvement of portions of EL1 (extracellular loop one), EL3, and the NH2-terminal extracellular region of TM1 (transmembrane 1) in the specificity of ligand recognition (47Sen M. Marsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 968-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,48Sen M. Shah A. Marsh L. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Studies with random mutagenesis of Ste2p and screening for receptors responding to antagonists proposed an important role for F55 in TM1 in both ligand binding and signal transduction (49Abel M.G. Lee B.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis of Ste2p and different α-factor analogues, Lee et al. (50Lee B.K. Khare S. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37950-37961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the tenth residue of α-factor was in close proximity to Ser47 and Thr48 in TM1 of Ste2p. Measurement of biophysical properties of fluorescent α-factors bound to Ste2p indicated that the binding pocket was formed by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, suggesting contributions to ligand binding from both extracellular and transmembrane regions of the receptor (51Ding F.X. Lee B.K. Hauser M. Davenport L. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the putative glycosylation sites in the NH2 terminus and on EL1 indicated that glycosylation was not required for pheromone binding and receptor activation (52Mentesana P.E. Konopka J.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9685-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent photoaffinity labeling study identified a region of Ste2p spanning portions of TM6, EL3, and TM7 as the site of cross-linking to the side chain of position 1 of α-factor (53Henry L.K. Khare S. Son C. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6128-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite all of these studies, no previous analysis has discriminated specific residues in the extracellular loops involved in binding and/or receptor activation. Here we report our studies on residues of EL1, the first extracellular loop of Ste2p. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of these residues revealed a region (residues 102–114) of the receptor that appears to be involved in signaling but that is not critical for ligand binding. Moreover, the key residues (102, 105, 108, 111, and 114) required for receptor activation exhibit a periodicity consistent with their spatial presentation on one face of a 310 helix. LM102 and LM23–3az yeast strains described by Sen and Marsh (47Sen M. Marsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 968-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used in these studies. The genotype for the LM102 strain is: MATa, bar1, his4, leu2, trp1, met1, ura3, FUS1-lacZ::URA3, ste2-dl (deleted for the region coding for the α-factor receptor). LM23-3az has the same genotype as LM102 except that it contains an intact chromosomal STE2 gene coding for the α-factor receptor. LM23-3az was used only to study dominant negative effects of certain mutant receptors on the function of wild-type (WT)STE2 (see “Results”). The LM102 strain was used as the recipient for the transformation with WT and the site-directed mutantSTE2. Measurement of the pheromone-induced growth arrest (halo assay), pheromone-induced gene expression (FUS1-lacZassay), and determination of pheromone binding were done in the LM102 host strain. Both LM102 and LM23–3az strains carried thebar1 mutant allele, which inactivated the BAR1protease responsible for degradation of α-factor, and aFUS1-lacZ gene, which served as a pheromone-inducible reporter. The WT STE2 gene with a native promoter was cloned into a yeast/bacterial shuttle vector pGA314.WT (49Abel M.G. Lee B.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was used as a template strain for the subcloning of the FLAGTM epitope and His6 tag and further site-directed mutagenesis of the α-factor receptor gene. This plasmid carries the TRP1 gene as a selectable marker and is a low copy CEN-based plasmid. The first step in generation of the site-directed mutantSTE2 was the creation of a pGA314.WT plasmid coding aSTE2 gene product tagged with the FLAGTM epitope and His6 affinity sequence at the 3′ end of theSTE2 gene. For this, the plasmid pNED described by Davidet al. (54David N.E. Gee M. Andersen B. Naider F. Thorner J. Stevens R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15553-15561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used as the source of the COOH-terminal epitope tags. STE2 in pNED contains an 81-bp region at its 3′ end that codes for the 24-bp FLAGTM epitope (DYKDDDDK), the 30-bp Gly-rich flexible tether (TGVPRGSGSS), the 18-bp His6affinity tag (HHHHHH), and the 9-bp unrelated sequences (SSG) followed by a stop codon. The desired region of STE2 containing the 3′-tagged sequences was removed by digestion with SalI and the generated 121-bp fragment was gel purified using the MERmaid kit (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA). The pGA314.WT plasmid was digested withSalI, which produced a 6.272-kb fragment coding for theSTE2 gene that lacked its 3′ end sequences. This fragment was dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and gel purified using Geneclean III kit (Bio 101). The 121-bp fragment insert purified from the pNED vector was ligated into the 6.272-kb fragment purified from the pGA314.WT vector using T4 DNA ligase (Promega, Madison, WI). Correct orientation of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The 6.393-kb plasmid thus generated coded for the STE2 gene with 3′ FLAGTM epitope (FT) and His6 tag (HT) sequences, and allowed expression ofSTE2 under its native promoter. This plasmid was referred to as pGA314.STE2.FT.HT and it served as the template for further site-directed mutagenesis. All primers were purchased from Sigma/Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Sequences of the primers used are presented in Table I. DNA sequencing was carried out in the DNA sequencing facility located on the campus of the University of Tennessee.Table IPrimers used in the site-directed mutagenesis of STE2.FT.HT 1-aUsed to generate STE2.FT.HT that is devoid of its native cysteine residues.

Single-stranded phagemid DNA of pGA314.STE2.FT.HT was prepared by infectingEscherichia coli strain CJ236 (dut−ung−) carrying pGA314.STE2.FT.HT with the helper phage M13K07 (55Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded phagemid DNA of pGA314.STE2.FT.HT was constructed as described previously (56Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar, 57Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The product of the mutagenesis reaction mixture was transformed into DH5α (Invitrogen) E. coli strain, and transformants were selected on ampicillin-containing plates. Plasmids were then isolated from transformants using the Wizard Miniprep kit (Promega). After sequencing of the isolated plasmids to confirm correct incorporation of the intended mutations (C59S and C252S), constructs were transformed into yeast strain LM102 (ste2 deletion strain), and transformants were selected by their growth on medium lacking tryptophan. This plasmid, referred to as pGA314.Cys-less.STE2.FT.HT, served as the template on which Cys-scanning mutagenesis of EL1 of Ste2p was performed. Preparation of single-stranded phagemid DNA of pGA314.Cys-less.STE2.FT.HT and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded phagemid pGA314.Cys-less.STE2.FT.HT DNA were done as described in the previous section for pGA314.STE2.FT.HT. The product of the mutagenesis reaction mixture was transformed into E. coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen), and transformants were selected on ampicillin-containing plates. Plasmids were then isolated from transformants using the Wizard Miniprep kit (Promega). Each construct was subjected to sequencing to confirm correct incorporation of the intended mutations (single Cys substitution on each residue of EL1) prior to transformation into the ste2 deletion yeast strain LM102, and subsequent selection of transformants by their growth on the medium lacking tryptophan. In the case of partially active and nonfunctional cysteine-substituted mutant receptors (as determined by growth arrest assay, see “Results”), plasmids from three independent isolates were transformed into yeast to confirm that the observed phenotypes were because of the intended single cysteine mutation but not because of the presence of spurious mutations. S. cerevisiae strains LM102 (strain with the ste2 deletion) and LM102 (pGA314.STE2 or pGA314.mutantSTE2) (the strain containing a plasmid encoding Ste2p or mutant Ste2p) were grown, and membranes containing or lacking Ste2p and mutant Ste2p receptors were prepared as described previously (54David N.E. Gee M. Andersen B. Naider F. Thorner J. Stevens R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15553-15561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All manipulations with membranes and all purification steps were carried out at 4 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors (1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 17.4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Membranes were solubilized in sample buffer (50 mm Na2CO3, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 15% (w/v) sucrose, 2.5% SDS). Equal amounts of solubilized membrane proteins (2–10 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%), electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with FLAGTM antibody (IBI, Kodak, Rochester, NY). The resulting immune complexes were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Yeast nitrogen base medium with ammonium sulfate without amino acids (Difco) with 2% glucose (SD medium), supplemented with histidine (20 μg/ml), leucine (30 μg/ml), and methionine (20 μg/ml), was overlaid with 4 ml of cell suspension (2.5 × 105 cells/ml, 1.1% Nobel agar). Filter discs (sterile blanks from Difco), 6 mm in diameter, were impregnated with 10-μl portions of α-factor solutions at various concentrations and placed onto the overlay. The α-factor used was [Nle12]α-factor, which was isosteric, equiactive, and has the same binding affinity as the wild-type pheromone (58Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24–36 h and then observed for clear zones (halos) around the discs. The data were expressed as the diameter of the halo including the diameter of the disc. All assays were carried out at least three times with no more than a 2-mm variation in halo size at a particular amount of α-factor. A molar extinction coefficient of 13,500 at 280 nm was used for adjusting α-factor concentration throughout the study. The data were plotted as halo size versus the amount of peptide, and linearized by regression analysis using PrismTM software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). To compare the relative activities of α-factor with different receptors, the amount of peptide producing a halo of a particular size was determined from the regression line of dose-response curves. S. cerevisiaeLM102 and LM23–3az contain a FUS1-lacZ gene that was inducible by mating pheromone. Cells were grown overnight in SD medium supplemented with the required amino acids at 30 °C to 5 × 106 cells/ml, washed by centrifugation, and grown for one doubling (hemocytometer count) at 30 °C. Induction was performed by adding 0.5 ml of α-factor at various concentrations to 4.5 ml of concentrated cells (1 × 108 cells/ml) to give final α-factor concentrations of 0, 1 × 10−10, 1 × 10−9, 1 × 10−8, 1 × 10−7, and 1 × 10−6m. The mixtures were vortexed and placed at 30 °C with shaking for 2 h. After this incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and each pellet was resuspended and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (expressed as Miller units) in duplicate by modification (59Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) of a standard protocol (60Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 61****Google Scholar) usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as the substrate. EC50 (concentration of peptide required to give half-maximal activation) and Emax (maximal activation obtained from the highest peptide concentration, 1 × 10−6m) values were calculated with a 95% confidence interval using PrismTM software (GraphPad) with a sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting, variable slope equation. Each experiment was carried out at least two times with similar results in each assay. Saturation and competition binding assays were performed using [3H]α-factor. Cells were grown overnight at 30 °C and harvested at 1 × 107cells/ml by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were washed two times in ice-cold YM-1 medium (62Abel M.G. Zhang Y.L., Lu, H.F. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and resuspended at 6.25 × 107 cells/ml. [3H]α-Factor was prepared by reduction of [dehydroproline8, Nle12]α-factor as described previously (58Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The competition binding assays were started by the addition of [3H]α-factor as described in detail elsewhere (62Abel M.G. Zhang Y.L., Lu, H.F. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 63Liu S. Henry L.K. Lee B.K. Wang S.H. Arshava B. Becker J.M. Naider F. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In saturation binding assays, various concentrations of [3H]α-factor were added to the cell suspension. Specific binding was determined by subtracting counts associated with the LM102 (ste2 deletion) strain from counts bound to the strains harboring WT or mutant receptors. Each experiment was carried out at least three times with similar results. Nonspecific binding of labeled α-factor to filters in the absence of cells was less than 20 counts/min. Data curves for competition and saturation binding assays were fitted from at least eight triplicate data points using PrismTM software (GraphPad) with nonlinear regression one site competition, and nonlinear regression one site saturation hyperbola equations, respectively.

Unfortunately, the insolubility and heterogeneity of PrP(Sc) have limited these studies. The observation that a construct of 106 amino acids (termed PrP106 or miniprion), derived from mouse PrP and containing two deletions (Delta 23-88, Delta 141-176), becomes protease-resistant when expressed in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells and sustains prion replication when expressed in PrP(0/0) mice prompted us to generate a corresponding synthetic peptide (sPrP106) to be used for biochemical and cell culture studies. sPrP106 was obtained successfully with a straightforward procedure, which combines classical stepwise solid phase synthesis with a purification strategy based on transient labeling with a lipophilic chromatographic probe. sPrP106 readily adopted a beta-sheet structure, aggregated into branched filamentous structures without ultrastructural and tinctorial properties of amyloid, exhibited a proteinase K-resistant domain spanning residues 134-217, was highly toxic to primary neuronal cultures, and induced a remarkable increase in membrane microviscosity. These features are central properties of PrP(Sc) and make sPrP106 an excellent tool for investigating the molecular basis of the conformational conversion of PrP(C) into PrP(Sc) and prion disease pathogenesis."

We aimed to determine whether a structurally conserved human HP1 protein exhibits conserved heterochromatin localization in plant cells and studied its relation to modified histone H3. We generated transgenic tobacco plants and cycling cells expressing the human HP1γ fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and followed its association with chromatin. Plants expressing GFP-HP1γ showed no phenotypic perturbations. We found that GFP-HP1γ is preferentially associated with the transcriptionally “inactive” heterochromatin fraction, a fraction enriched in Lys-9-methylated histone H3. During mitosis GFP-HP1γ is detached from chromosomes concomitantly with phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and reassembles as cells exit mitosis. However, this phosphorylation cannot directly account for the dissociation of GFP-HP1γ from mitotic chromosomes inasmuch as phosphorylation does not interfere with binding to HP1γ. It is, therefore, possible that phosphorylation at serine 10 creates a “code” that is read by as yet an unknown factor(s), eventually leading to detachment of GFP-HP1γ from mitotic chromosomes. Together, our results suggest that chromatin organization in plants and animals is conserved, being controlled at least partly by the association of HP1 proteins with methylated histone H3.

Gorz A. Weising K. Schafer W. Hirasawa E. Kahl G. Architecture of Eukaryotic Genes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1988: 301-332Google Scholar). The fundamental structural unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, is made up of two copies of each of the four core histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This basic structure of chromatin can be further organized into higher order chromatin structure by the aid of various proteins including histone H1, polycomb proteins, and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).1 Dynamic changes in chromatin structure are directly influenced by post-translational modifications of histone amino-terminal tails. Within histone tails there are specific amino acids (arginine, lysine, serine) that undergo a number of post-translational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and poly(ADP-ribosylation) (2van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). The “histone code” hypothesis predicts that modifications on histone amino-terminal tails act sequentially or in combination to form a code for recruitment of various proteins involved in controlling the diverse chromatin functions such as gene expression, recombination, and DNA replication (4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2001; 403: 41-45Crossref Scopus (6623) Google Scholar). The effect of the chromatin state of condensation on gene transcription is exemplified by the so-called position effect variegation phenomenon in Drosophila. Position effect variegation occurs when euchromatic genes are translocated to heterochromatic regions, resulting in a variegated (mosaic) expression pattern (5Dorer D.R. Henikoff S. Cell. 1994; 77: 993-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 6Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1263-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). One of the best-studied modifiers of position effect variegation is theSu(var)2–5 gene encoding the HP1 protein (7Weiler K.S. Wakimoto B.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 577-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 8Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet.

HP1-like proteins are composed of two related functional domains, an amino-terminal chromo domain (chromatinorganization modifier) (CD) and a carboxyl-terminal chromo shadow domain (CSD) (11Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3168-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that HP1 proteins function as chromatin organizers, participating in the assembly of multi-protein complexes that promote silencing of euchromatic genes and the expression of heterochromatic genes interspersed in heterochromatic domains (12Eissenberg J.C. Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Some of the molecular events leading to HP1-induced heterochromatinization have been recently resolved with the discovery of histone methyltransferase activity associated with the human SUV39H1 and the fission yeast Clr4 proteins (13Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). These enzymes specifically methylate histone H3 at lysine 9 residue, generating a binding site for HP1 (14Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Methylated (Lys-9) histone H3, however, may not be the sole factor in targeting HP1 to chromosomal DNA (18Cowell I.G. Aucott R. Mahadevaiah S.K. Burgoyne P.S. Huskisson N. Bongiorni S. Prantera G. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S., Wu, R. Gilbert D.M. Shi W. Fundele R. Morrison H. Jeppesen P. Singh P.B.

In addition to methylation, other types of covalent modifications were extensively studied including acetylation, which is associated with transcriptional activation (23Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), and histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10, a modification strictly occurring during meiosis and mitosis both in plants and animals, although its function is unknown (24Hans F. Dimitrov S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). HP1-like proteins have been recently characterized in plants (Ref. 25Gaudin V. Libault M. Pouteau S. Juul T. Zhao G. Lefebvre D. Grandjean O. Development. 2001; 128: 4847-4858PubMed Google Scholar, Plant Chromatin Data Base (www.chromdb.org)). A mutation in LHP1 ofArabidopsis (lhp1) led to changes in flowering time, leaf development, and plant architecture (25Gaudin V. Libault M. Pouteau S. Juul T. Zhao G. Lefebvre D. Grandjean O. Development. 2001; 128: 4847-4858PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that developmental processes in plants are controlled at least partly by HP1-mediated formation of heterochromatin. Although a single HP1 gene was identified in the Arabidopsis genome, the HP1 family in human comprises three different proteins with distinct chromosome distributions in interphase nuclei. The human HP1α and HP1β reside mainly in centromeres, whereas HP1γ is distributed in multiple small foci outside the nucleoli (26Minc E. Allory Y. Worman H.J. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1999; 108: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), similarly to the nuclear distribution of the Arabidopsis LHP1 protein (25Gaudin V. Libault M. Pouteau S. Juul T. Zhao G. Lefebvre D. Grandjean O. Development. 2001; 128: 4847-4858PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a structurally conserved human HP1 protein exhibits conserved heterochromatin localization in plant cells, we generated transgenic tobacco plants and BY-2 cycling cells expressing the human HP1γ fused to GFP under the constitutive 35 S promoter. We studied the dynamic association of GFP-HP1γ with chromatin with respect to histone H3 modifications. Plants overexpressing the GFP-HP1γ did not display phenotypic alterations and had wild type morphology. Our results show that GFP-HP1γ and methylated histone H3 are confined to heterochromatin in interphase nuclei. During mitosis GFP-HP1γ is detached from chromosomes concomitantly with phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and reassembles as cells exit mitosis. We provide evidence showing that the detachment of HP1γ from mitotic chromosomes cannot be accounted for by phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 inasmuch as this phosphorylation does not interfere with binding of HP1 to lysine 9-methylated histone H3. The implications of our findings for chromatin organization are discussed. Human HP1γ (GenBankTM accession number U26312) was isolated from mammalian cDNA library by PCR using the primers HP1-sense (S) (5′-CAATGAATTCGGATCCATGGGAAAAAAACAGAATGGAAAGAG) and HP1-antisense (AS) (5′-CAATGAATTCCTCGAGTTATTGAGCTTCATCTTCTGG). The PCR product was digested by BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases and subcloned into the same sites of either pBluescript SK (Stratagene) to generate pBs-HP1γ or pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences) to generate pGEX-HP1γ. The chromo domain (CD) and the chromo shadow domain (CSD) were amplified by PCR using pBs-HP1γ as template DNA. We used HP1-S and CD-AS (5′-AATGAATTCCTCGAGTTTTGTACCATCTTTTTCTTTGCC) primers for amplification of the CD and HP1-AS and CSD-S (5′-CAATGAATTCGGATCCATGAAAAGAAAATCTTTATCTGAC) for the CSD. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the same sites of pGEX-2T to generate pGEX-CD and pGEX-CSD. To fuse the GFP upstream from HP1γ, the GFP DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using pEGFP (CLONTECH) as a template and the primers GFP-S (5′-GTTCTCTGGATCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG) and GFP-AS (5′-GTTCTCTAGATCTTGTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and BglII and subcloned into the BamHI site of pbsHP1γ upstream from HP1γ DNA fragment. Several clones were isolated and sequenced to select for the appropriate pBs-GFP-HP1γ clone. To subclone GFP-HP1γ into a binary vector for plant transformation, the GFP-HP1γ fragment was amplified by PCR using pBs-GFP-HP1γ as a template, T3 primer, and HP1-AS primer in which the stop codon was eliminated, and a SmaI site was introduced (5′-CCCGGGTTGAGCTTCATCTTCTGGAC). The PCR product was digested with XbaI and SmaI and subcloned into the same sites of pPZP111–3HA (27Tang G. Zhu X. Tang X. Galili G. Plant J. 2000; 23: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to introduce GFP-HP1γ downstream from the 35 S promoter and in-frame with the HA epitope. The plasmid pPZP111-GFP-HP1–3HA was introduced into tobacco BY-2 cells and Nicotiana tabacum using the Agrobacteriummethodology. All PCR reactions were performed using the thermostable DNA polymerase Pwo (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which has a proofreading activity. The identity and integrity of the PCR products were verified by sequencing. In experiments presented here we used F3 homozygous plants for 35S::GFP-HP1γ. Tobacco BY-2 cells stably transformed with 35S::GFP-HP1γ were synchronized (partly) with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerase α (28Ikegami S. Taguchi T. Ohashi M. Oguro M. Nagano H. Mano Y. Nature. 1978; 275: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Briefly, BY-2 cells at the stationary phase (7 ml) were transferred into 50 ml of fresh medium containing 2 μg/ml 2,4-dichlorophenoxic acid (2,4-D) and 7.5 μg/ml aphidicolin and incubated for 24 h at 26 °C with gentle shaking. Aphidicolin was removed by extensive washing of cells with fresh medium. Cells were then transferred into fresh medium supplemented with 2,4-D, incubated as above, and sampled at various time points after the release from aphidicolin. Each sample was incubated on ice for 10 min to let the cells settle down, medium was removed, and the sample was kept frozen at −20 °C. Cell cycle progression was determined in each sample by the frequency of mitotic figures (occurrence of metaphases and anaphases) after staining with propidium iodide (PI, 1 mg/ml in 0.1% Triton X 100). Cells were inspected by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a CCD camera (Imago, Photonics) or by a Zeiss confocal microscope (510 scanning system). Images were pseudo-colored and merged using TILL Vision version 3.3 software. Olympus filters U-MWIBA2, U-MNG, and U-MNU were used to detect GFP, propidium iodide (PI), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole signals, respectively. Synchronization was verified by analyzing SUC1-associated histone H1 kinase activity (29Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared by a combination of methods described by van Blokland et al. (30van Blokland R. ten Lohuis M. Meyer P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 257: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Remboutsika et al. (31Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leaves from 35S::GFP-HP1γ transgenic tobacco plants were ground using pestle and mortar in buffer N (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 250 mmsucrose, and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin; Sigma). The homogenate was gently stirred for 30–60 min on ice and filtered through a 150-μm nylon mesh followed by centrifugation (4 °C, 1000 × g, 10 min). The pellet was gently washed to remove the upper chloroplast layer, nuclei pellets were recovered, and nuclei were washed twice with buffer N. Fractionation of chromatin was performed essentially as described (31Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Huang S.Y. Garrard W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 116-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei (75 μl) were digested with increasing amounts (2, 5, and 10 units per 2 × 106nuclei) of micrococcal nuclease (MBI Fermentas) at room temperature for 12 min. A portion of the digested nuclei was used for DNA preparation as described (33Zhao J. Morozova N. Williams L. Libs L. Avivi Y. Grafi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22772-22778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The remaining micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-digested nuclei were cooled on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S1) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After a 10-min incubation on ice samples were centrifuged as above, the supernatant (S2) was collected, and the pellet (P) was resuspended in 65 μl of SDS buffer. Equivalent samples were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-HA and anti-dimethylated (Lys-9) histone H3. DNA was run on 1.5% agarose gel followed by ethidium bromide staining. In vitro histone methyltransferase reactions were performed with glutathione-Sepharose containing GST-SUV39H1(H320R) (kindly provided by T. Jenuwein and S. Opravil) essentially as described (13Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl in methylase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 250 mm sucrose) containing as substrates free histones prepared from tobacco leaves (34Zhao J. Grafi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27494-27499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 300 nCi ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (25 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) as the methyl donor. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, reactions were added SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by 15–18% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and fluorography. We generated transgenic tobacco plants and BY-2-cycling cells expressing HA-tagged GFP-HP1γ under the control of the 35 S promoter. BY-2 cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 1, A and B) showed the GFP signal both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, the GFP-HP1γ fusion protein was exclusively localized to the nucleus both in BY-2 cells (Fig. 1, C and D) and in tobacco mesophyll cells (Fig.1F), indicating that HP1γ directed GFP into the nucleus. Often GFP-HP1γ showed a speckle-like distribution in the nucleus (not shown). Immunoblotting analysis using anti-HA confirmed the production of GFP-HP1γ fusion protein in transgenic BY-2 cells (Fig.1E) and in tobacco mesophyll cells (Fig. 1G). Neither BY-2 cycling cells nor tobacco plants expressing GFP-HP1γ showed any change in their growth kinetics and morphology compared with their wild type counterparts (data not shown). HP1 proteins are preferentially associated with heterochromatic regions in animal interphase nuclei (12Eissenberg J.C. Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To determine the chromatin distribution of GFP-HP1γ in transgenic plants, nuclear fractions enriched with transcriptionally “active” or inactive chromatin were prepared from transformed mesophyll cell nuclei subjected to mild MNase digestion in a low salt sucrose-containing solution (31Remboutsika E. Lutz Y. Gansmuller A. Vonesch J.L. Losson R. Chambon P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1671-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Huang S.Y. Garrard W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 116-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This treatment yields a soluble fraction (S1, shown in Fig.2A) enriched in oligonucleosomes representing the potentially transcriptionally active chromatin (euchromatin). Hypotonic extraction of the MNase-digested nuclei pellet yields a soluble fraction (S2, shown in Fig.2A), which is enriched in polynucleosomes, representing the transcriptionally inactive chromatin (heterochromatin) (32Huang S.Y. Garrard W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 116-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Incubation of nuclei with increasing concentrations of MNase resulted in the formation of a typical nucleosomal ladder, with the mononucleosome fraction enriched at the higher MNase concentrations (Fig. 2, B and C). To determine whether GFP-HP1γ was associated with euchromatin (S1) or heterochromatin (S2), equivalent samples of S1, S2, and the pellet fraction (P) were immunoblotted either with anti-HA to detect GFP-HP1γ or with anti-dimethylated (Lys-9) histone H3. Fig.2D shows that the GFP-HP1γ was preferentially associated with the S2 and P fractions but not with the S1 fraction. Methylated (Lys-9) histone H3 showed a similar distribution. These results demonstrated the localization of both GFP-HP1γ and methylated (Lys-9) histone H3 to the heterochromatin fraction. To determine the GFP-HP1γ distribution during various phases of the cell cycle, BY-2 cells expressing GFP-HP1γ were synchronized by incubating them for 24 h with aphidicolin. After removal of aphidicolin, cells were sampled at various time points, and cell cycle progression was determined by fluorescence microscopy after staining the cells with PI. More than 50% of BY-2 cells reached mitosis 9 h after aphidicolin removal, with the majority exhibiting anaphase appearance (data not shown). Synchronization was also verified by histone H1 kinase activity purified by glutathione-Sepharose containing GST-SUC1 (data not shown). Fluorescence microscopy analyses showed uneven distribution of GFP-HP1γ in the nucleus during interphase (Fig.3; see also panel 5Fig. 4A). Notably, although PI stained nucleoli quite intensely, the GFP-HP1γ protein was hardly noticeable in this nuclear compartment, consistent with a previous report (26Minc E. Allory Y. Worman H.J. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1999; 108: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). During mitosis, the GFP-HP1γ protein was absent from chromosomes; prophase, metaphase, and anaphase chromosomes were stained with PI only (Fig. 3). However, as cells completed mitosis, the GFP-HP1γ protein reassociated with chromosomes (Fig. 3, Telophase). Confocal microscopy analysis (Fig.4A) verified that GFP-HP1γ was not associated with mitotic chromosomes; a diffused GFP signal could be detected in the cytoplasm. Western blot analysis verified that the absence of GFP-HP1γ protein from mitotic chromosomes was not due to degradation of the protein because the GFP-HP1γ remained stable throughout the cell cycle (Fig.4B).FIG. 4GFP-HP1γ is detached from mitotic chromosomes but is undegraded during mitosis. A, sequential confocal optical sections (slices of 2.2 μm, 1–6) of nuclei expressing GFP-HP1γ. Metaphase and anaphase nuclei are indicated by arrows (panel 1). An overlay PI/GFP is shown. Note that the GFP signal is absent from mitotic chromosomes throughout the various sections; a diffused GFP signal can be detected in the cytoplasm. The inset panelin 6 is a higher magnification of an interphase nucleus showing differential, uneven distribution of the GFP and PI signals.B, the amount of GFP-HP1γ remains constant during the cell cycle. Total protein extract (20 μg) prepared from transformed BY-2 cells at the indicated time points was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-HA to detect GFP-HP1γ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The possibility existed that the release of GFP-HP1γ from chromatin during mitosis resulted from a post-translational modification(s) of its interacting protein(s). The preferential association of HP1γ and methylated (Lys-9) histone H3 with the transcriptionally inactive fraction (shown in Fig. 2D) as well as recent publications showing the interaction between HP1 proteins and histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (14Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar, 15Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the capability of HP1γ to bind histone H3 from tobacco leaves. GST pull-down assays were performed with glutathione-Sepharose containing GST alone, GST-HP1γ, GST-CSD (containing HP1 chromo shadow domain), and GST-CD (containing HP1 chromo domain). As shown (Fig.5A, upper panel), the tobacco leaf acid-soluble fraction contained three polypeptides (ranging from 14 to 16 kDa) that reacted with anti-H3 (lane 1). GST-HP1γ (Fig. 5A, lane 3) bound two of the three histone H3 polypeptides, an interaction that required the HP1γ chromo (GST-CD, lane 5) but not the chromo shadow domain (GST-CSD, lane 4). By using anti-dimethylated (Lys-9) histone H3 we showed that the histone H3 polypeptides pulled-down by GST-HP1γ were methylated at lysine 9 (Fig. 5A, lower panel). The capability of GST-HP1γ to pull-down in vitro methylated (lysine 9) histone H3 was examined by using the hyperactive mutated form of the human histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1 (H320R) (13Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). Hence, acid-soluble fraction prepared from tobacco leaves was subjected to in vitro histone methyltransferase assay in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose containing GST alone, GST-SUV39H1 (H320R), GST-E1A, and GST-HP1γ. As shown in Fig. 5B, methylation of histone H3 occurred only with GST-SUV39H1 (H320R), and the resultant methylated form was bound by GST-HP1γ but not by GST alone (Fig. 5C). We next investigated whether detachment of HP1γ from chromosomes during mitosis was related to phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, a modification previously reported to occur strictly during mitosis both in plants and animals (24Hans F. Dimitrov S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 35Houben A. Wako T. Furushima-Shimogawara R. Presting G. Kunzel G. Schubert I.I. Fukui K. Plant J. 1999; 18: 675-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pedrosa A. Jantsch M.F. Moscone E.A. Ambros P.F. Schweizer D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2001; 110: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Histone proteins (acid-soluble fraction) from BY-2 cells at various time points after the release from aphidicolin were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 6A) or immunoblotted using anti-phospho (S10) histone H3 (Fig. 6B). Indeed, the phosphorylated form of histone H3 was found only during mitosis (Fig.6B, 9 and 10 h), concomitantly with dissociation of HP1γ from chromosomes (shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4A). This temporal correlation could have suggested that phosphorylation of histone H3 during mitosis renders GFP-HP1γ incapable of binding histone H3, hence leading to its release from chromosomes. We therefore investigated whether the detachment of GFP-HP1γ from chromosomes during mitosis resulted from its failure to interact with histone H3. Acid-soluble fractions obtained from synchronized BY-2 cells at various time points after removal of aphidicolin were subjected to pull-down assay using glutathione-Sepharose containing GST-HP1γ followed by immunoblotting either with anti-H3 or anti-phospho (S10) H3. As shown (Fig. 7A, upper panel), GST-HP1γ pulled down histone H3 throughout all stages of the cell cycle. However, although during S and G2 phases (lanes 2–5) GST-HP1γ pulled down two major H3 isoforms, during mitosis it bound three H3 isoforms (lanes 6–7), one of which was phosphorylated at serine 10 (Fig. 7A, lower panel, lanes 6 and 7). To examine whether the phosphorylated (S10) histone H3 was methylated at the lysine 9 residue, acid-soluble fractions from BY-2 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho (S10) histone H3 or precipitated with GST-HP1γ followed by immunoblotting with anti-dimethylated (Lys-9) histone H3. Several isoforms of histone H3 bound to GST-HP1γ were methylated at lysine 9 (Fig. 7B, lane 4). The anti-phospho (S10) histone H3 precipitated one major isoform of histone H3 that reacted with anti-dimethylated H3 (Fig. 7B, lane 3).FIG. 7HP1 γ can interact with serine 10-phosphorylated histone H3.

To explore this issue, we studied the regulation ofl-[3H]arginine transport by either exogenous or endogenous peroxynitrite in glial cells. A 2-fold peroxynitrite-mediated stimulation of l-arginine release in C6 cells was found to be Na+-independent, was prevented by 5 mm l-arginine and, although only in the presence of Na+, was blocked by 5 mm l-alanine or l-leucine. Peroxynitrite-mediated stimulation of l-arginine uptake was trans-stimulated by 10 mm l-arginine and was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion (ki of ∼40 μm) by the system y+ inhibitorN-ethylmaleimide in C6 cells. Endogenous production of peroxynitrite in lipopolysaccharide-treated astrocytes triggered an increased l-arginine transport activity without affectingCat1l-arginine transporter mRNA levels. However, Western blot analyses of peroxynitrite-treated astrocytes and C6 glial cells revealed a 3-nitrotyrosinated anti-Cat1-immunopositive band, strongly suggesting peroxynitrite-mediated Cat1 nitration. Furthermore, peroxynitrite stimulation of l-arginine release was abolished in fibroblast cells homozygous for a targeted inactivation of the Cat1 gene. Finally, peroxynitrite-triggered l-arginine released from astrocytes was efficiently taken up by neurons in an insert-based co-culture system. These results strongly suggest that peroxynitrite-mediated activation of the Cat1 transporter in glial cells may serve as a mechanism focused to replenish l-arginine in the neighboring neurons.

However, unlike in astrocytes, l-arginine content in neurons is very low and is limiting for nNOS activity (16Garthwaite J. Garthwaite G. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Eur. J.

Consistent with this, glial-derived l-arginine has been shown to be increased upon activation of ionotropic glutamate (non-N-methyl-d- aspartate) receptors (18Grima G. Benz B. Do K.Q. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2248-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and peroxynitrite (19Vega-Agapito V. Almeida A. Heales S.J.R. Medina J.M. Bolaños J.P. J.

However, direct demonstration of such a pathway and the elucidation of the precise transport system involved remain elusive. Plasma membrane l-arginine transport is brought about by two families of cationic amino acid transport proteins: Cat (cationic amino acid transporter) and Bat (broad scope amino acid transporter). The Cat family of transporters comprises three different genes encoding four isoform proteins (Cat1, Cat2, Cat2a, and Cat3) (20MacLeod C.L. Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. J. Exp.

We have reported previously that the neurotoxic ⋅NO derivative, peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−), specifically stimulatesl-arginine release from astrocytes (19Vega-Agapito V. Almeida A. Heales S.J.R.

Although the ONOO−-mediated stimulatory effect was inhibited byl-lysine, hence suggesting the involvement of systemy+ (19Vega-Agapito V. Almeida A. Heales S.J.R. Medina J.M. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), an in-depth study focused on elucidating the precise mechanism responsible forl-arginine transport activation has not yet been carried out. In view of the potential critical role of glial cells as neuronall-arginine suppliers for ⋅NO biosynthesis (8Grima G. Cuénod M. Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. Do K.Q. J.

Progr. Neurobiol. (N.

Peroxynitrite was synthesized and quantified spectrophotometrically (ε302 = 1,670m−1 × cm−1) as described previously (30Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. Abstr. 1968; : 450-452Crossref Google Scholar). Alkaline stock solutions, with an approximate ONOO− concentration of 0.3–0.4 m, were stable at −70 °C for at least 3–4 months. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), amino acids, and N-ethylmaleimide were obtained from Sigma. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics.l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from AmershamBiosciences. The iNOS inhibitor 2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine (AMT) and the ⋅NO donor 1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NO) were purchased from Alexis Corp.

Cell culture inserts (Millicell-PCF; 4.2 cm2 of effective membrane area; 0.4-mm membrane pore size) were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Hybond® nitrocellulose membrane was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-Cat1 antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. M. Kilberg (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL). Anti-3-Nitrotyrosine antibody was kindly provided by Dr. J. Beckman (Department of Anesthesiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Other substrates, enzymes, and coenzymes were purchased from Sigma, Roche Diagnostics or Merck. Astroglia-rich primary cultures derived from neonatal 1-day-old Wistar rats were prepared as described previously (31Bolaños J.P. Peuchen S. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Heales S.J.R. Brain Res. Protoc. 1997; 1: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at a density of 1.25 × 105cells/cm2 in 150-cm2 flasks. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C with a change of medium twice a week. After 12–14 days, astrocytes reached confluence, and cells were collected by trypsinization, reseeded in DMEM/10% FCS at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 either in 6-well plates or in cell culture inserts as described previously (32Bolaños J.P.

Neuronal-rich primary cultures were prepared from fetal (embryonic day 17) rats as described previously (33Delgado-Esteban M. Almeida A. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1618-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and grown at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in poly-d-lysine-coated dishes in DMEM/10% FCS. Forty-eight h after plating, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum and 20 mm d-glucose. On day 4 of culture, cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to prevent non-neuronal proliferation, and neurons were used on day 8. For astrocytic-neuronal co-cultures, astrocyte-containing inserts were placed on the top of 8-day-old neuronal cultures and bathed with Hanks' buffer. C6 glioma cells (passage number 48) were kindly provided by Prof. B. Hamprecht (Tübingen, Germany) and were maintained in DMEM/10% FCS. Cells were passaged twice per week and were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 24 h before experiments. Mouse fibroblast cell line K047, which is homozygous for inactivation of the Cat1 gene (Cat1−/−) (34Perkins C.P. Mar V. Shutter J.R. del Castillo J. Danilenko D.M. Medlock E.S. Ponting I.L. Graham M. Stark K.L. Zuo Y. Cunningham J.M. Bosselman R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 914-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as the wild type were maintained in DMEM/10% FCS/1% non-essential amino acids. Cells were passaged twice per week and were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 24 h before experiments. Release experiments were carried out essentially as described previously (19Vega-Agapito V. Almeida A. Heales S.J.R. Medina J.M. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after reseeding, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed once with prewarmed (∼37 °C) Hanks' buffer (5.26 mm KCl, 0.43 mmKH2PO4, 132.4 mm NaCl, 4.09 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mmNa2HPO4, 5.44 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) or Na+-free Hanks' buffer (NaCl was replaced by 132.4 mm choline chloride). Cells were then incubated in fresh Hanks' buffer (with or without Na+) containing 1 μCi/mll-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (50 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Extensive washing was performed until a constant basal l-[3H]arginine release was found. Then, ONOO− (100 μm) was added, and the radioactivity released from the cells was measured after 5 min. When appropriate, all incubations were carried out in the presence of 5 mm l-arginine, l-alanine, orl-leucine. The final buffer pH varied between 7.3 and 7.4. Control cells were treated in the same way except that the ONOO− solution was degraded previously in Hanks' buffer at 37 °C for 15 min before being added to the cells. In some experiments, astrocytes were preincubated for 24 h with LPS (1 μg/ml) alone, LPS in combination with AMT (50 μm), or DETA-NO alone (0.1 mm, which continuously releases 0.28 μm⋅NO for ∼24 h as measured with an ⋅NO electrode; ISO-NO, World Precision Instruments). In these experiments,l-arginine release experiments were carried out as above except that exogenous peroxynitrite was not included. Results were expressed as percentages of l-arginine release obtained in each treatment as compared with controls (degraded ONOO−-treated cells), which were arbitrarily given a value of 100%. Uptake experiments were carried out as described previously (5Westergaard N. Beart P.M. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Schmidlin A. Wiesinger H. Glia. 1994; 11: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after reseeding, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed once with prewarmed Na+-free Hanks' buffer. Cells were preincubated in Na+-free Hanks' buffer containing 50 μm l-arginine at 37 °C for 5 min. For trans-stimulation studies, cells were preincubated in Na+-free Hanks' buffer containing 10 mm l-arginine at 37 °C for 30 min. Uptake experiments were performed in fresh Na+-free Hanks' buffer containing 0.25 μCi/ml l-[2,3,4,5-3H]-arginine (50 μm). In experiments focused on inhibiting they+l-arginine transporter, all incubations were carried out in the presence ofN-ethylmaleimide at the indicated concentrations. Peroxynitrite additions (100 μm) and the appropriate controls were done as in the release experiments, and cells were incubated at 37 °C. After 5 min, the buffer was aspirated, and cells were rapidly washed three times with ice-cold Hanks' buffer. Cells were then lysed with 0.5 ml of 10 mm NaOH/0.1% Triton X-100, and the radioactivity present in the cell lysates was measured. In some experiments, astrocytes were preincubated for 24 h with LPS (1 μg/ml) alone, LPS in combination with AMT (50 μm), or DETA-NO alone (0.1 mm). In these experiments, l-arginine uptake experiments were carried out as above except that exogenous peroxynitrite was not included. Blanks were obtained from cells briefly (∼2 s) exposed tol-[3H]arginine medium on ice (∼0–4 °C) whose radioactivity was subtracted from sample values. Results were expressed as percentages of l-arginine uptake obtained in each treatment as compared with the controls (degraded ONOO−-treated cells), which were arbitrarily given a value of 100%. To study the neuronal uptake of l-arginine released from ONOO−-stimulated astrocytes, a co-culture system was used (32Bolaños J.P. Heales S.J.R. Peuchen S. Barker J.E. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Astrocytes seeded in cell culture inserts were loaded with 5 μCi/ml l-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine (50 μm) in Hanks' buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. After extensive washing, astrocyte-containing inserts were placed on the top of 8-day-old neuronal cultures and bathed with Hanks' buffer. Peroxynitrite (100 μm) was added, and the co-culture system was further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. After this incubation, inserts were removed, and neurons washed and lysed with 0.5 ml of 10 mm NaOH/0.1% Triton X-100 to determine the radioactivity present in the neuronal lysates. Blanks were performed as described above, and results were expressed as pmol ofl-arginine taken up/min/mg of protein. Controls were carried out using degraded ONOO−. In some experiments, neurons were depleted of l-arginine by incubating these cells in DMEM containing arginase (2 units/ml; Sigma) for 24 h as described previously (35Schmidlin A. Wiesinger H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) before the co-incubation with astrocytes. Cells were scraped off the plastic dishes with lysis buffer (12.5 mmNa2HPO4, 116 mm NaCl, 0.5m EDTA, 1% (by volume) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecylsulfate, 100 μmN-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmphenanthroline, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μmN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7) and 100 μg of protein from each sample, extemporarily determined following Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar), using ovalbumin as standard, and the BenchMarkTM prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen) were electrophoresed on 8% acrylamide gel (MiniProtan®, Bio-Rad) and transferred to a Hybond® nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) low fat milk Tween Tris buffer solution (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 (pH 7.5)) for 1 h and then incubated in the presence of the appropriate antibody (either anti-nitrotyrosine at 1:100 dilution or anti-Cat1 at 1:2000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, membranes were further incubated in 2% (w/v) low fat milk Tween Tris buffer solution for 45 min at room temperature in the presence of the appropriate (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (at 1:40,000 or 1:1,000 dilution, respectively) and immediately incubated with the luminol chemiluminescence reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 min before exposure to HyperfilmTM chemiluminescence film for 5 min. Northern blotting analysis was carried out in total RNA samples isolated from the cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described previously (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed (22 μg of RNA/line) on a 1% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel. After transfer to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cross-linking with ultraviolet irradiation (UV Stratalinker, Model 2400, Genetic Research Instruments, Essex, UK), membranes were hybridized for 18 h at 65 °C in the presence of the appropriate random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabelled cDNA probes and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. As cDNA probes, we used either a 0.9-kbiNOS cDNA fragment (a generous gift of Dr. Elena Galea, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) or a 0.9-kb Cat1cDNA fragment (generously provided by Dr. Manuel Palacı́n, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain). Immunocytochemistry was carried out on astrocytes grown on glass coverslips, which were fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized for 10 min with methanol at −20 °C. Cells were then incubated at room temperature in PBS containing blocking serum (10% normal goat serum) plus anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody for 3 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in PBS containing the secondary antibody (anti-mouse-IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate) for 2 h. Finally, coverslips were washed and developed using the SlowFade®light antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for fluorescence microphotographs. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. values for the number of culture preparations indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference multiple range test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To elucidate the mechanism involved in ONOO−-mediated l-arginine release (19Vega-Agapito V. Almeida A. Heales S.J.R. Medina J.M. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we first studied the Na+ dependence on this effect in C6 glial cells. Cells were loaded withl-[3H]arginine and incubated either in the absence (Na+-free, choline chloride-containing Hanks' buffer) or in the presence (Hanks' buffer) of Na+at 37 °C for 25 min and then exposed to 100 μmONOO− or to degraded ONOO−. After 5 min,l-arginine release was determined as reported previously (19Vega-Agapito V. Almeida A. Heales S.J.R. Medina J.M. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, ONOO− increased l-arginine release by about 2-fold both in the presence (Fig. 1A) and in the absence (Fig. 1B) of Na+. Supplementation of excess (5 mm) l-arginine, l-alanine, orl-leucine partially or fully prevented ONOO−-stimulated l-arginine release in the presence of Na+ (Fig. 1A). However, onlyl-arginine, but not l-alanine orl-leucine supplementation, was able to prevent ONOO−-mediated l-arginine release in the absence of Na+ (Fig. 1B). To further investigate the transport system involved in the ONOO−-mediated activation of l-arginine release in glial cells, we tested whether the release was trans-stimulated by l-arginine. To simplify the experimental design, l-arginine uptake instead of efflux was measured in the absence or presence of a large excess (10 mm) of extracellular l-arginine. Fig.1C shows that ONOO− significantly stimulated (by ∼1.6-fold) l-arginine uptake in the absence of 10 mm l-arginine. Moreover, in the presence of 10 mm l-arginine, ONOO−-mediated stimulation of l-arginine uptake was further increased by a factor of ∼1.4. Peroxynitrite-mediated stimulation ofl-arginine uptake was dose dependently abolished by the system y+-specific inhibitorN-ethylmaleimide (38Devés R. Angelo S. Chavez P. J. Physiol. 1993; 468: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Polynomial (n = 2) transformation of the data (not shown) yielded a ki of ∼40 μm forN-ethylmaleimide. In view of the possibility that system y+ might be involved in ONOO−-mediated stimulation of l-arginine transport, we were prompted to investigate the effect of ONOO− in cells lacking this type of transporter system. For this purpose, we used Cat1−/− fibroblast cells, which functionally lack this type of transporter (34Perkins C.P. Mar V. Shutter J.R. del Castillo J. Danilenko D.M. Medlock E.S. Ponting I.L. Graham M. Stark K.L. Zuo Y. Cunningham J.M. Bosselman R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 914-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the effect was compared with those observed in wild-type fibroblast cells, C6, and astrocytic cells, which constitutively express the Cat1 transporter (7Stevens B.R. Kakuda D.K., Yu, K. Waters M., Vo, C.B. Raizada M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24017-24022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We found that the stimulation caused by ONOO− on l-arginine release from wild-type fibroblast cells was very similar to that found in C6 cells and astrocytes (Fig. 2). However, this effect was fully abolished in homozygous (Cat1−/−)Cat1 knock-out fibroblast cells (Fig. 2). The functional protein modification by ONOO−-mediated nitration of 3-nitrotyrosine residues (3-nitrotyrosination) is now widely documented (39Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Estévez A.G. Spear N. Manuel S.M. Barbeito L. Radi R. Beckman J.S. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 118: 269-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the rapid effect brought about by ONOO− onl-arginine transport activity, we wondered whether Cat1 3-nitrotyrosination might be taking place under our own conditions. A 5-min incubation of intact C6 or astrocytic cells in the presence of 100 μm ONOO− revealed intense protein 3-nitrotyrosination, as judged by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody in both cell types (Fig.3). Interestingly, among other 3-nitrotyrosinated bands, in both C6 cells and astrocytes, a protein was also found to be anti-Cat1-immunopositive, as judged by parallel Western blotting using an antiserum raised against Cat1 protein (Fig.3). Either immunoprecipitation with anti-Cat1 and Western blotting with anti-3-nitrotyrosine or immunoprecipitation with anti-3-nitrotyrosine and Western blotting with anti-Cat1 were not successful, probably due to the very low level of nitrated Cat1 protein. In view of the evidence showing l-arginine transport activity stimulation by exogenous ONOO− and to elucidate the possible physiological relevance of this phenomenon, we were prompted to investigate the possible role of endogenous ONOO− formation on l-arginine transport activity. Accordingly, we used astrocytes in primary culture incubated with LPS (1 μg/ml), an endotoxin that is well known to induce iNOS in these cells (9Simmons M.L. Murphy S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 10Galea E. Feinstein D.L. Reis D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have corroborated iNOS induction (Fig. 4D) as well as functional iNOS activity by measuring LPS-mediated, AMT- (50 μm) inhibitable nitrite released to the culture medium (results not shown) (42Cidad P. Garcı́a-Nogales P. Almeida A. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endogenous ONOO−formation was also confirmed by immunocytochemical evidence for LPS-mediated 3-nitrotyrosine formation in these cells (Fig.5B). Since ONOO−synthesis requires ⋅NO reaction with O2⨪ (43Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (66"

L., Mehdi, A., and Rao, U. S. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 3424–3432) that tryptic cleavage of Pgp results in the activation of basal and drug-stimulated ATPase functions of Pgp. To understand this phenomenon, we determined the sites cleaved by trypsin and further examined whether the modulation of Pgp function is trypsin-specific or the result of proteolysis in general. The effects of chymotrypsin and proteinase K on Pgp ATPase function were studied. The results show that proteolysis of Pgp irrespective of the protease employed resulted in the activation of basal ATPase activity. However, drug-stimulated ATPase activities were differentially modulated. Immunoblot analysis of proteolytic digests indicated that, irrespective of the protease employed, Pgp was predominantly cleaved in the middle of the molecule. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of Pgp tryptic and chymotryptic peptides indicated Arg680 and Leu682 as the sites of cleavage, respectively. These two cleavage sites are part of the predicted linker region that joins the two halves of Pgp. Together, these results suggest that the linker region in Pgp is primarily accessible to protease action and that cleavage of this region modulates Pgp ATPase function.

It is now established that Pgp is a drug transporter that utilizes the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to pump the anticancer drugs out of cancer cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the MDR1cDNA indicates that Pgp is a polypeptide of 1280 amino acids and shares considerable sequence and structural homology with members of the ABC superfamily of membrane transporters (1Gottesman M.M.

The structure predicted by computer-assisted predictive algorithms indicates that Pgp consists of two homologous (N- and C-terminal) halves that share nearly 43% amino acid sequence similarity (6Germann U.A.

As this region harbors a number of phosphorylation sites and charged amino acids, it is thought to be analogous to the R domain of CFTR (cysticfibrosis transmembrane conductanceregulator) (15Chambers T.C.

Although the reason for this discrepancy is unclear, it is conceivable that a mammalian plasma membrane component may be serving as a transport substrate, thus leading to the exhibition of apparent basal Pgp ATPase activity. In the presence of transport substrates, Pgp exhibits high ATPase activity, which is known as drug (transport substrate)-stimulated ATPase activity (20Germann U.A.

Utilizing human Pgp expressed in Sf9 insect cells, we have recently reported that incubation of Pgp with trypsin results in cleavage of the molecule in the middle region, as judged by the formation of N- and C-terminal halves (28Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pgp thus cleaved exhibits high basal ATPase and increased drug-stimulated ATPase activities. However, the identity of the sites that are cleaved was not determined. We report in this study the identity of a site cleaved by trypsin. The results presented also indicate that the linker region is a primary target of cleavage for proteases. We infer that the linker region plays a key role in coupling the ATPase and drug transport functions of Pgp. Standard molecular biological procedures (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were utilized in the preparation of all DNA constructs. The Transformer Mutagenesis procedure (CLONTECH) was utilized to introduce the desired mutations into theMDR1 cDNA using mutagenic oligonucleotides synthesized at the DNA Sequencing Facility of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the cDNAs at the above facility. A cDNA sequence coding for peptide sequence HHHHHHM was introduced into theMDR1 cDNA such that the C terminus of the encoding Pgp ended with the above sequence. The protein expressed is called His6-Pgp. Lys433 and Asp555 in the first ABD and Lys1076 and Asp1200 in the second ABD were mutated to Met433, Asn555, Met1076, and Asn1200, respectively, and the corresponding mutant MDR1 cDNAs were prepared. Stop codons were introduced into the MDR1 cDNA to express Pgp proteins truncating at residues 1220, 1222, and 1264. All of theseMDR1 cDNAs were subcloned into the pVL1393 baculoviral transfer vector under the transcriptional control of the polyhedrin promoter. The Sf9 insect cells were cotransfected with these cDNAs and BaculoGold DNA (BD PharMingen) to prepare the corresponding recombinant baculoviruses according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Preparation of a baculovirus carrying the wild-type human Pgp cDNA was reported previously (25Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The monolayers of Sf9 insect cells growing in tissue culture flasks were infected with the above recombinant baculoviruses, and the total membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (25Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were resuspended in Tris/glycerol buffer (50 mmTris, 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30% (w/v) glycerol (pH adjusted to 7.0 with HCl) and stored at −20 °C for later use. A total membrane fraction obtained from Sf9 insect cells infected with a baculovirus carrying α-ENaC (40Rao U.S. Mehdi A. Steimle R.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was used as the control. Treatment of the membrane suspension with trypsin was carried out as described previously (28Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with chymotrypsin or proteinase K (1 mg/ml of 1 mm HCl) at a membrane protein:protease ratio of 1000:1 (w/w) at room temperature. The final volume of protease in the mixture was always maintained at 1% (v/v). At the end of the incubation, proteolysis was arrested by the addition of excess soybean trypsin inhibitor or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The ATPase activities were measured as reported previously (28Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (5 μg) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 0.1 ml of the ATPase reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH adjusted to 6.8 with HCl), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmEGTA, 5 mm NaN3, and 5 mm MgATP. The assays were stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of 5% (w/v) SDS solution, and the liberated inorganic phosphate was measured colorimetrically as described by Sarkadi et al. (27Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity in the Pgp-containing membranes after subtracting the ATPase activity in the control membranes identically assayed is termed basal Pgp ATPase activity. The drug-stimulated Pgp ATPase activity was measured in the above-mentioned ATPase reaction mixture that contained 1 μl of drug (verapamil/vinblastine/colchicine prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide), and the activity obtained was corrected for the basal ATPase activity. The concentrations of verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine in the ATPase assays were 100, 10, and 250 μm, respectively. The His6-Pgp digests were incubated with octyl β-glucopyranoside (0.5%, w/v) in phosphate buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 1m NaCl, and 20% glycerol (pH 8.0)) for 1 h on ice with occasional mixing. The material was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min; and the supernatant (soluble fraction), which contained the majority of the Pgp peptides, was collected and supplemented with Triton X-100 (0.05%, w/v). This was then subjected to Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration chromatography (1 × 100-cm column) in phosphate buffer containing Triton X-100 (0.05%, w/v). The fractions containing Pgp peptides were further enriched by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (QIAGEN Inc.). The fractions enriched with the Pgp peptides were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (6%, w/v) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described (28Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The desired Pgp peptides identified by immunoblotting of a small portion of the membrane were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing at the Protein Core Facility of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and protein estimations were carried out as described (25Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Characterization of the NH211 antibody was described previously (28Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Verapamil, vinblastine, colchicine, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and Sepharose CL-6B-200 were obtained from Sigma. Chymotrypsin and proteinase K were obtained from Worthington. The C219 and C494 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA), and Calbiochem. The Sf9 insect cell culture media were obtained from Invitrogen. Prestained protein markers (broad range) were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. The SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting reagents were obtained from Fisher and Bio-Rad. To study the effect of protease treatment on Pgp, α-ENaC (control)- and Pgp-containing membranes were incubated with either chymotrypsin or proteinase K at a membrane protein/protease ratio of 1000:1 (w/w); and at regular time intervals, the ATPase activity was measured in the ATPase reaction mixture lacking any Pgp transport substrate. The ATPase activity in the control and Pgp-containing membranes before incubation with proteases was ∼30 nmol of Pi released per min/mg, which was considered to be 100%. Fig. 1shows that the basal ATPase activity in the Pgp-containing membranes increased gradually to a maximum of ∼180 and 140% within 30 min upon incubation with chymotrypsin and proteinase K, respectively. However, the ATPase activity in the control membranes under these conditions was unaltered. In this study, we also used membranes prepared from Sf9 insect cells infected with a variety of recombinant baculoviruses carrying cDNAs of membrane proteins that are not ATPases. These protease treatments did not increase the ATPase activities in these membranes (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that proteases stimulate transport substrate-independent ATPase activity in Pgp-containing membranes. The protease digests obtained from the above experiment (Fig.1) were assayed for verapamil-, vinblastine-, and colchicine-stimulated ATPase activities (28Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the results are shown in Fig.2. The control membranes did not exhibit any drug-stimulated ATPase activity before or after incubation with proteases (data not shown). The verapamil-, vinblastine-, and colchicine-stimulated ATPase activities in the Pgp-containing membranes before the beginning of protease treatment were ∼90, 30, and 15 nmol of Pi released per min/mg of membrane protein, respectively, which were considered to be 100%. The verapamil- and vinblastine-stimulated Pgp ATPase activities gradually decreased to ∼75 and 60%, respectively, upon incubation with either chymotrypsin or proteinase K. Interestingly, the colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity gradually increased to a maximum of ∼200% upon incubation with these proteases. To further establish that protease treatment increases the colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity, the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis by the chymotrypsin-treated and untreated Pgp membranes in the presence of colchicine were compared. The results indicated that the ATP hydrolysis by both the treated and untreated Pgp membranes was linear with time, with an increased initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by the chymotrypsin-treated Pgp membranes (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the action of the two proteases on Pgp results in differential modulation of ATPase activity stimulated by different transport substrates. To determine whether Pgp was cleaved in the above protease incubations, the protease digests of the above experiments were analyzed by Western blotting using the NH211, C219, and C494 antibodies. (The locations of the epitopes of these antibodies are shown schematically in Fig. 5.) Fig.3A shows that incubation of Pgp with chymotrypsin resulted in a gradual disappearance of full-length ∼140-kDa Pgp and the concomitant appearance of a group of three closely migrating peptides in the ∼80-kDa region of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels as detected with the NH211 antibody, indicating that these peptides originate from the N-terminal half of Pgp. Also, a group of three closely migrating peptides in the ∼80-kDa region of the gels were reactive with the C219 antibody (Fig. 3B). Upon longer incubation with the protease, a minor population of three closely migrating faintly stained peptides were detected in the ∼58–60-kDa region by the C219 antibody (Fig. 3B). Three closely migrating peptides (which appeared as a single band) in the ∼58–60-kDa region of the gels were detected by the C494 antibody (Fig. 3C), suggesting that these peptides correspond to the C-terminal half of Pgp.FIG. 3Western blot analysis of chymotryptic digests of Pgp. Pgp chymotryptic digests were subjected to Western blot analysis using the NH211 (A), C219 (B), and C494 (C) antibodies. The 140-kDa band represents full-length Pgp, and the Pgp peptides released are indicated by their approximate molecular masses. To determine the relationship between the peptides recognized by these antibodies, following electrotransfer of the proteins, the membrane was cut into three portions, and each was developed with the indicated antibody (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the relationship between peptides identified by different Pgp-specific antibodies, the Pgp chymotryptic digest (1000:1 (w/w) ratio, 45 min) was loaded in a broader well of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis and electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membrane was cut into three portions. Each portion was developed as a separate Western blot using the NH211, C219, and C494 antibodies. Alignment of these Western blots suggested that the mobilities of the three NH211 antibody-reactive ∼80-kDa peptides and the three C219 antibody-reactive ∼80-kDa peptides are similar (Fig.3D), suggesting that these peptides contain both the NH211 and C219 antibody epitopes and therefore originate from the N terminus of Pgp, include the first C219 epitope (568VQVALD574), and end somewhere after residue 574. The three C219 antibody-reactive ∼58–60-kDa peptides did not react with the NH211 antibody. However, these three peptides comigrated with the three C494 antibody-reactive ∼58–60-kDa peptides, suggesting that these peptides contain both the C219 (the second epitope, 1213VQEALD1219) and C494 antibody epitopes and therefore correspond to the C-terminal half of Pgp. Fig. 4 shows the results from Western blot analyses of the proteinase K digests of Pgp-containing membranes. The blots developed with three different antibodies indicate the gradual disappearance of full-length 140-kDa Pgp upon incubation with proteinase K (Fig. 4, A–C). Three peptides migrating in the region of ∼80 kDa and reactive with the NH211 antibody and thus originating from the N terminus of Pgp were generated with time of digestion with proteinase K (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, at least 10 peptides in the ∼80–54-kDa range were reactive with the C219 antibody (Fig. 4B). Five of these peptides (marked with braces) migrated closely in the ∼80-kDa region and together appeared as a single peptide. This was due to overexposure of the blot to the x-ray film, which allowed the identification of the remaining minor peptides (60–54-kDa range) present in the digests. Finally, the blot developed with the C494 antibody indicated the presence of at least four peptides in the ∼58–60-kDa range (Fig. 4C), indicating that these peptides correspond to the C-terminal half of Pgp. To determine the relationship between all of these peptides, Western blots of a Pgp digest of proteinase K (1000:1 (w/w) ratio, 45 min) developed with the NH211, C219, and C494 antibodies were aligned as described above and indicated that the five peptides in the ∼80-kDa group reacted with both the NH211 and C219 antibodies (Fig.4D). This suggests that these peptides contain epitopes of both the NH211 and C219 antibodies and thus represent the N-terminal half of Pgp. The four C219 antibody-reactive peptides in the ∼58–60-kDa region also reacted with the C494 antibody, but not the NH211 antibody, suggesting that these peptides likely contain the second C219 epitope (1213VQEALD1219) and correspond to the C-terminal half of Pgp. However, the two C219 antibody-reactive minor peptides that migrated in the 56–54-kDa range did not react either with the NH211 or C494 antibody, suggesting further cleavage of some of these above peptides. To determine whether the removal of the C terminus of Pgp by proteases that could not be detected in the Western blot analyses was responsible for the observed modulation of its ATPase activities, three Pgp forms were prepared by introducing stop codons just after the putative tryptic sites Lys1220, Arg1222, and Lys1264. None of these mutants exhibited any basal or drug-stimulated ATPase activities in the presence of verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine before or after protease digestions (data not shown). Because the longest Pgp among these mutants is Pgp-(1–1264) and because the only available tryptic site after Lys1264 is Lys1279, which is the penultimate residue in the Pgp molecule, these results suggest that the C terminus is essential in Pgp ATPase function. Thus, it is unlikely that the C terminus of Pgp was cleaved by proteases in the incubations. To test the hypothesis that the N- and C-terminal halves generated by proteolytic cleavage of Pgp exhibit ATPase activity independently, a mutation was introduced in either of the ABDs in the molecule. It has been previously demonstrated that mutations in the consensus sequences of Walker A (Lys433 → Met and Lys1076 → Met) and Walker B (Asp555 → Asn and Asp1200 → Asn) of either the first or second ABD result in"
https://openalex.org/W2037867272,"The sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex (pro-SI) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein of the intestinal brush border membrane. Its synthesis commences with the isomaltase (IM) subunit and ends with sucrase (SUC). Both domains reveal striking structural similarities, suggesting a pseudo-dimeric assembly of a correctly folded and an enzymatically active pro-SI. The impact of each domain on the folding and function of pro-SI has been analyzed by individual expression and coexpression of the individual subunits. SUC acquires correct folding, enzymatic activity and transport competence and is secreted into the external milieu independent of the presence of IM. By contrast, IM persists as a mannose-rich polypeptide that interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum resident molecular chaperone calnexin. This interaction is disrupted when SUC is coexpressed with IM, indicating that SUC competes with calnexin for binding of IM. The interaction between SUC and the membrane-anchored IM leads to maturation of IM and blocks the secretion of SUC into the external milieu. We conclude that SUC plays a role as an intramolecular chaperone in the context of the pro-SI protein. To our knowledge all intramolecular chaperones so far identified are located at the N-terminal end. SUC is therefore the first C-terminally located intramolecular chaperone in mammalian cells.

The most crucial events take place in the ER1 and include folding, subunit assembly, and in many cases oligomerization (for review see Ref. 1Gething M.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These steps, individually or altogether, lead ultimately to the acquisition of the protein to a transport-competent conformation that enables its egress from the ER. A number of resident proteins of the ER, such as the molecular chaperones BiP and calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase, play primordial roles in these processes that vary from binding of unfolded proteins to the formation of disulfide bonds between individual subunits or within a single polypeptide chain (2Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 4Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins assemble into homodimers, oligomers, or heterodimers preceding protein exit from the ER (5Kreis T.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Correct protein folding of the individual monomers or subunits is required for optimal completion of these events. Many proteins are known not to go into dimers or heterodimers, such as the brush border proteins sucrase-isomaltase (SI) (7Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), angiotensin-converting enzyme (8Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and maltase-glucoamylase (9Nichols B.L. Eldering J. Avery S. Hahn D. Quaroni A. Sterchi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3076-3081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An interesting and common feature of these proteins is their composition of an even number of homologous domains. SI, for example, is an enzyme complex that is made of two subunits that share ≥ 35% of amino acid sequence similarity and 41% of conserved sequences (10Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although no three-dimensional structure of this large protein is so far available, algorithmic predictions suggest that the two large domains are folded similarly and that the native folded state of the SI enzyme complex can be referred to as a pseudo-dimer (10Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The striking similarity between the two subunits has led to the concept that SI has emerged from one cycle of duplication of a single gene (10Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). An important structural aspect of SI is that the two subunits reside on the same polypeptide. The enzyme is synthesized as a single chain polypeptide that is cleaved extracellularly in the intestinal lumen by pancreatic trypsin, generating the two subunits that remain closely associated with each other by strong non-covalent ionic interactions (7Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hauri H.P. Wacker H. Rickli E.E. Bigler-Meier B. Quaroni A. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4522-4528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunits are therefore generated very late in the biosynthesis after the single chain form of SI, pro-SI, has acquired its complete transport efficiency and has reached its final destination in the brush border membrane. The question that arises in this respect is that of a possible role of each of the domains in the folding of the other and of the significance of either subdomain in the context of ensuring a correct protein folding and transport-competent configuration of the whole enzyme complex. The structural requirements and the mechanisms of assembly of heterodimeric complexes have been analyzed for several proteins such as fibrinogen (12Xu W. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol.

Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many of these examples the individual components of the heterodimers fold independently, and in some cases are also transported and secreted into the extracellular milieu. Nevertheless, for the generation of functional units or efficiently transported heterodimeric complexes along the secretory pathway each subunit must associate or interact with other members of the complex. Not as well explored are the roles and mechanisms of folding of homologous subdomains within one single polypeptide chain. By virtue of its structural features SI is an exquisite model protein for analyzing molecular aspects of protein-protein interactions and their consequence on intracellular trafficking and function. Not only is the protein structure of SI interesting, but also pathophysiological cases in which naturally occurring mutant phenotypes of SI provide a suitable model to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular protein transport and polarized sorting (19Fransen J.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Hauri H.P. Roth J. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of the SI mutant phenotypes, phenotype V, revealed an unusual intracellular cleavage after complex glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus. After this cleavage the sucrase (SUC) domain was degraded, and the isomaltase (IM) domain was correctly transported and sorted to the apical membrane (19Fransen J.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These data have proposed that the complete polarized sorting information of pro-SI are located in the IM region. The role of the IM or SUC domains in the events preceding sorting, e.g. ER to Golgi transport, remained unanswered. If SUC is not needed for sorting, then what would be its role in the context of transport and folding of the whole pro-SI species? A possible role of SUC in attenuating the folding of the pro-SI polypeptide is suggested upon consideration of another phenotype of sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. In phenotype II a Q1098P mutation in the SUC domain leads to a transport block of pro-SI in the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and cis-Golgi (22Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this paper we have addressed questions related to the role of the SUC and IM domains by expressing the individual subunits in transfected cells and analyzing their transport and folding rates. We show that the SUC domain folds independently of the remainder of the pro-SI molecule and functions as an intramolecular chaperone in the context of the folding of the IM subunit, which is not transport-competent. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChangeTMin vitromutagenesis system from Stratagene was applied to introduce a stop codon at nucleotides 2878–2881. This encodes Arg1007, the last amino acid of IM. The template constituted a full-length cDNA encoding pro-SI cloned into pSG8-vector (22Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used in this context: Isostopupstream, 5′-AAT ACT GCA AAT GCC TGA ATA AAG GTA CCA TCT G-3′ and Isostopdownstream, 5′-CAG ATG GTA CCT TTA TTC AGG CAT TTG CAG TAT T C-3′. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and the plasmids obtained were denoted pSG8-IM, pSG8-IMSOL, or pIM-YFP. SUCSOL was cloned in two steps. At first the cDNA encoding the signal sequence of pro-LPH, LPHsignal, was amplified by PCR as described before (25Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SUC cDNA comprising the last 20 nucleotides of the LPH signal sequence (nucleotides 52–71) and nucleotides 2882–5483 of SUC was synthesized by PCR of the pro-SI cDNA template and the oligonucleotides LPHsig/suc (GTT TTT CAT GCT GGG GGT CAA TAA AGT TAC CTT CTG ACC CCA) and cSUCXhoI (CCC CTC GAG GTC GAC GGT). Both DNA fragments were then fused by assembly PCR and cloned into the uniqueEcoRI/XhoI sites of the pSG8 expression vector. The resulting construct, denoted pSG8-SUCSOL, was sequenced and found to contain the signal sequence of pro-LPH fused in-frame to the SUC cDNA beginning with nucleotide 2882. The next construct, pSG8-SUCMA, was generated by loop-out mutagenesis of IM from the pro-SI cDNA with the primer pair Delisoupstream (CTT ATT CCT TGG TGC ATA AAG TTA CCT TCT) and Delisodownstream (AGA AGG TAA CTT TAT GCA CCA AGG AAT AAG) and the QuikChangeTM in vitro mutagenesis system from Stratagene. In this reaction 2703 base pairs coding for 901 amino acids of IM were deleted in-frame to generate SUC, which is anchored to the plasma membrane by the type II membrane anchor of pro-SI (pSG8-SUCMA). The resulting cDNA of SUCMAwas verified by sequencing. pSG8-IM, pSG8-IMSOL, pSG8-SUCSOL, pcDNA3-SUCMA, pIM-YFP, and pJB20-LPHβ (an expression vector for the LPHβ mature region of intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase) (26Jacob R. Peters K. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8217-8225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were diluted in 1.5 ml of serum-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 500 μg of DEAE-dextran and transfected transiently using DEAE-dextran as described previously (26Jacob R. Peters K. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8217-8225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cotransfection experiments were performed with mixtures of pSG8-IM and pSG8-SUCSOL, pSG8-IM and pJB20-LPHβ, or pIM-YFP and pSG8-SUCSOL. 48 h after the start of transfection, the cells were used for biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation as described before (26Jacob R. Peters K. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8217-8225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or for confocal laser microscopy. Transfected COS-1 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine as described previously (26Jacob R. Peters K. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8217-8225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Biosynthetically labeled cells were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 17.4 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Usually 1 ml of ice-old lysis buffer was used for each 100-mm culture dish (∼2–4 × 106 cells). The medium and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with epitope-specific mAbs directed against IM, SUC, or SI. These were products of the following hybridomas: HBB 1/691, HBB 2/614, HBB 2/219, and HBB 3/705 (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). LPHβ was immunoprecipitated with a mAb that was a product of hybridoma HBB 1/909/34/74 (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation procedures were performed essentially according to Naim et al. (7Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments the culture media after the biosynthetic labelings were collected, protease inhibitors were added and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-IM or anti-SUC. A possible interaction of SUC and IM in cotransfected COS-1 cells was assessed using mAbs that recognize either IM (HBB 3/705) or SUC (HBB 2/219) (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were fixed and analyzed by a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). The immunoprecipitates from transiently transfected [35S]methionine-labeled COS-1 cells were treated with 15 or 30 μg of trypsin for the indicated times at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected COS-1 cells grown on coverslips were fixed 2 days post-transfection with 3% paraformaldehyde and analyzed using a Leica TCS SP2 microscope with a ×63 water planapochromat lens (Leica) (24Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling of SUC in cotransfected cells was performed using HBB 2/219 as primary antibody and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Sequential scans with a 543-nm He/Ne laser or the 458- and 514-nm excitation lines of an argon laser and the optimal emission wavelength spectra for rhodamine, CFP, and YFP were employed for dual color CFP and YFP or rhodamine and YFP imaging. The digestion of immunoprecipitates with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F (endo F) was performed as described previously (7Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed according to Towbin et al. (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The anti-calnexin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. David Y. Thomas (Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Canada) (4Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The antigenic material was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) on Kodak X-Omat film. IM and SUC activities were measured according to Dahlqvist (29Dahlqvist A. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 22: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Activities of IM and SUC within pro-SI were assessed using wild type pro-SI expressed in COS-1 cells. Triton X-114 extraction was performed essentially as described by Wilson et al. (30Wilson J.M. Whitney J.A. Neutra M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The impact of SUC and IM domains on the generation of a transport-competent configuration of pro-SI was addressed in conjunction with the question of whether either domain can fold independently. For this, we made several cDNA constructs encoding each individual domain, expressed these in COS-1 cells, and assessed the folding patterns and transport kinetics of the recombinant proteins. One construct included the entire IM sequence containing its own transmembrane segment, the non-cleavable signal sequence, and the heavily O-glycosylated stalk region (denoted IM). To generate a potentially soluble form of IM, the sequences encoding the entire transmembrane domain were deleted. This signal sequence for ER translocation contained in the transmembrane of IM was replaced by the cleavable signal sequence of intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (denoted IMSOL). Analogous to IM, a SUC construct was made containing the cleavable LPH signal sequence (SUCSOL). An additional construct was made in which the membrane-anchoring domain of LPH was fused to the C-terminal end of SUC (SUCMA). This panel of constructs should provide information regarding the folding of each domain and the influence of membrane anchoring in this context. The cDNA construct encoding IM was transfected into COS-1 cells, which were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated with a mixture of mAb anti-SI. Fig.1A shows that IM was revealed exclusively as a mannose-rich glycosylated polypeptide as determined by its complete sensitivity to treatment with endo H. Longer labeling periods did not result in a different band pattern. The IM domain of pro-SI contains a Ser/Thr-rich domain, the site of heavyO-glycosylation within the pro-SI species. This type of glycosylation commences in the cis-Golgi and is terminated in the trans-Golgi network (31Steiner D.F. Docherty K. Carroll R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because IM is notO-glycosylated and persists exclusively as an endo H-sensitive polypeptide the data demonstrate that this form did not traverse the ER to the Golgi apparatus to be processed to a complex glycosylated protein. To delineate the basis for this transport block, we analyzed the folding pattern of IM in protease sensitivity studies. In these experiments trypsin was used because this protease cleaves wild type pro-SI to IM and SUC (7Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are trypsin-resistant. An alteration in the sensitivity of these species toward trypsin is therefore reminiscent of an altered folding pattern. Fig. 1Bshows that IM was entirely degraded upon trypsin treatment. By contrast, native and correctly folded IM generated from wild type pro-SI by trypsin was resistant to further treatment with protease during similar periods. Altogether, the biosynthetic labeling data and the trypsin assay demonstrate that individual expression of IM in COS-1 cells results in a malfolded and transport-incompetent glycoprotein. Furthermore, these findings shed light on a potentially critical role of SUC in facilitating the folding of IM. Analysis of the function of a protein is a useful tool in providing information on its folding status. Thus, we measured the enzymatic activity of IM and compared it with that of pro-SI. There was no detectable activity of IM supporting the view that IM is not correctly folded. Having examined the folding and biosynthesis of IM the next step was to analyze the biosynthetic and structural features of individually expressed SUC as an essential step toward the delineation of the influence of either domain, IM or SUC, on the folding and transport behavior of the other. SUC does not possess a signal sequence for translocation into the ER, and the signal sequence of the full-length pro-SI molecule is located in the transmembrane domain of the IM subunit (10Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A construct was therefore generated that contained the entire SUC sequence to which the cleavable signal sequence of intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase has been fused at the N-terminal end (SUCSOL). Transfection of this fusion protein into COS-1 cells revealed a mannose-rich endo H-sensitive polypeptide in the cell lysates of the biosynthetically labeled cells. Because SUCSOL does not possess a membrane-anchoring domain, transport competence of this form would be compatible with its secretion into the external milieu. As shown in Fig. 2A a diffuse band larger than the mannose-rich cellular SUCSOL species was immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-SUC antibodies from the culture medium. This species was also endo H-resistant, reminiscent of a complex glycosylation and maturation in the Golgi apparatus. These results demonstrate that SUCSOL is a hydrophilic protein that, unlike IM, has egressed the ER and has been processed in the Golgi apparatus and secreted from the cell. On the other hand, the proportion of secreted mature SUC relative to its mannose-rich polypeptide (55 versus 45%) is reminiscent of a slow transport and processing rate of this form as compared with complete pro-SI. Here, almost 80% of mannose-rich pro-SI was converted to a complex glycosylated species during a similar labeling period. We asked whether an altered folding pattern of SUCSOL upon individual expression may account for the delay in transport and processing kinetics. Therefore, we probed the folding of SUCSOL using the trypsin sensitivity assay previously employed for IM. Fig. 2B demonstrates that SUC was resistant to trypsin. Treatment of wild type pro-SI with trypsin generated the SUC and IM subunits that were similarly trypsin-resistant. These results demonstrate that no additional trypsin cleavage sites were exposed in the individually expressed SUC, strongly suggesting that the folding pattern of SUC and SUC within the pro-SI species is similar. To further corroborate these data we measured the enzymatic activity of SUCSOL. Here individually expressed SUC revealed an enzymatic activity comparable with that within the pro-SI enzyme complex, supporting the view that SUCSOL is a correctly folded protein. Together, the similar reactivity toward trypsin of individually expressed SUC and the enzymatic activity of SUCSOL suggest that gross structural alterations or novel folding determinants are unlikely to have been elicited in individually expressed SUCSOL. The striking structural homologies between SUC and IM have suggested that the evolution of pro-SI implicates one cycle of gene duplication whereby IM is coded by the initial gene and SUC by the later emerging gene (10Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The high proportion of identical amino acids found in both proteins that are organized in numerous stretches over the pro-SI protein as well as the high number of conserved amino acids has led to the idea that SUC and IM are similarly folded and therefore form pseudo-dimers (10Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Along this concept and in a fashion similar to its homologous counterpart SUC, a correctly folded and a transport-competent configuration of individually expressed IM would be anticipated. Although this was not the case, as the experiments presented above clearly demonstrated, two important differences in the structural features between IM and SUC should be considered, which may ultimately play a substantial role in influencing the folding pattern and transport competence of IM. First, IM is associated with the membrane through its non-cleavable signal sequence, and second, it contains immediately upstream the membrane-anchoring domain a Ser/Thr-rich stalk domain, the site of heavy O-glycosylation of the pro-SI in the Golgi. One attractive hypothesis would attribute the ability of SUC or the failure of IM to adopt a correct folding to the absence or presence of the transmembrane domain and the stalk region. The corollary to this would be that the transmembrane domain in the IM constitutes a constraint that hinders an efficient and flexible formation of secondary structures of the luminal part of IM. To test this hypothesis we fused the transmembrane domain of IM containing the signal sequence into the N-terminal end of SUC and analyzed the biosynthetic and structural features of this hybrid protein (denoted SUCMA). This hybrid protein was sensitive to treatment with endo H, reminiscent of a mannose-rich type of glycosylation and ER localization (Fig.3A). We further examined whether this SUCMA is indeed membrane-bound, and for this purpose we performed phase separation using Triton X-114. As shown in Fig. 3B SUCMA was entirely recovered in the detergent phase compatible with its association with the membrane. Therefore, in contrast to the soluble form of SUC (SUCSOL) SUCMA did not acquire correct folding in the ER and as a consequence failed to egress the organelle. This was further corroborated by the complete degradation of SUCMA by trypsin and the lack of enzymatic activity (data are not shown). Altogether, the data demonstrate that fusing the membrane region of IM to the soluble form of SUC results in a protein that did not acquire correct folding and is ultimately blocked in the ER as a mannose-rich glycosylated protein. The reverse experiment was also performed. Here, a soluble IM protein was generated in which the membrane-anchoring and stalk domains of IM were truncated and replaced by the cleavable signal sequence of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Expression of this form, IMSOL, revealed an exclusively mannose-rich glycosylated polypeptide (Fig. 3C) that was not secreted into the external milieu. It is obvious that the conversion of IM to a soluble protein is not associated with the acquisition of transport competence. It is likely, therefore, that the folding pattern of IM is not entirely similar to that of SUC. Despite the strong similarities between SUC and IM some subtle differences may exist that affect the overall patterns of these two domains."

This study examines the effect on inhibition of relocating the reactive site (Leu-358) of the serpin α1-antichymotrypsin either one residue closer (P2) or further (P1′) from the base of the RSL (Glu-342). α1-Antichymotrypsin variants were produced by mutation within the P4-P2′ region; the sequence ITLLSA was changed to ITLSSA to relocate the reactive site to P2 (Leu-357) and to ITITLS to relocate it to P1′ (Leu-359). Inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like proteases human chymase and chymotrypsin and the non-target protease human neutrophil elastase (HNE) were analyzed. The P2 variant inhibited chymase and chymotrypsin but not HNE. Relative to P1, interaction at P2 was characterized by greater complex stability, lower inhibition rate constants, and increased stoichiometry of inhibition values. In contrast, the P1′ variant inhibited HNE (stoichiometry of inhibition = 4) but not chymase or chymotrypsin. However, inhibition of HNE was by interaction with Ile-357, the P2 residue. The P1′ site was recognized by all proteases as a cleavage site. Covalent-complexes resistant to SDS-PAGE were observed in all inhibitory reactions, consistent with the trapping of the protease as a serpin-acyl protease complex. The complete loss in inhibitory activity associated with lengthening the Glu-342-reactive site distance by a single residue and the enhanced stability of complexes associated with shortening this distance by a single residue are compatible with the distorted-protease model of inhibition requiring full insertion of the RSL into the body of the serpin and translocation of the linked protease to the pole opposite from that of encounter.

Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar, 2Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). A feature common to all mechanisms is recognition of the inhibitor by the protease in a manner resembling that of a substrate. That is, S1-P1 interactions, according to standard nomenclature (3Schechter I. Berger A.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4777) Google Scholar), determine the site of encounter and the specificity of the interaction. The P1 residue of a protease inhibitor is termed the reactive site. The reactive site is located within a specialized region of the inhibitor termed the reactive site loop (RSL)1 or bait region in the case of α2-macroglobulin. Serpins possess a relatively large reactive site loop of ∼22–26 residues (4Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Despite the size, the reactive site appears limited to a position 16 or 17 residues from the N-terminal base of the RSL, marked by the highly conserved residue Glu-342 (4Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of a trypsin-α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) complex suggests an explanation for this restriction. The crystal structure showed the protease ∼70 Å from the presumed point of encounter and residues P17-P3 of the RSL inserted into the face of the inhibitor as the 4th strand of a 6-strand A-β-sheet structure (6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). At the interface region between the two proteins, the P1 residue of the serpin was covalently tethered to the protease through an ester bond with Ser-195. Active site structure, especially around the P1 residue of the serpin, was highly distorted, giving rise to the impression that the protease was trapped in a deformed-uncatalytic state by compression against the serpin. These observations imply that a length of about 17 residues was required to translocate the covalently tethered protease to the opposite end of the inhibitor where it was denatured by being forced against the rigid body of the serpin. Although a number of spectroscopic studies using site-specific fluorescent labels support the location of the inhibited protease at the pole opposite from that of encounter (7Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Fa M. Bergstrom F. Hagglof P. Wilczynska M. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Structure Fold.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7560-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) place the enzyme closer to, if not at, the site of encounter. The latter studies suggest that only partial insertion of the RSL is required for inhibition. Among this group is a spectroscopic study similar to those that find the protease at the pole opposite of encounter (9O'Malley K.M. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6631-6639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As suggested by O'Malley and Copperman (9O'Malley K.M. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6631-6639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), controversy over protease location and the extent of RSL insertion raises the possibility for multiple sites on the serpin capable of mediating inhibition. Partial insertion models cannot easily explain the need for a large RSL and the restricted location of the reactive site within the RSL. Also not as evident from partial insertion models is why interaction at sites in the vicinity of P1 (typically P7-P3) produce cleavage and irreversible inactivation of the serpin instead of inhibition (13Potempa J. Shieh B.-H. Travis J. Science. 1988; 241: 699-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Schechter N.M. Sprows J.L. Schoenberger O.L. Lazarus G.L. Cooperman B.S. Rubin H. J. Biol.

Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) moved the reactive site of α1-PI Pittsburgh 1–3 residues closer or further from the beginning of the RSL (Glu-342). The results demonstrated a sharp change in inhibition/substrate properties depending on the direction of the change and the distance from Glu-342 (18Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These findings were interpreted as support for the full-insertion protease distortion mechanism implied by the crystal structure (6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). In this study, the effect on inhibition of relocating the reactive site of the serpin α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) one residue closer or further from Glu-342 was evaluated using three different proteases. The three enzymes, bovine chymotrypsin, human chymase, and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) were studied because each emphasizes a different aspect of protease-serpin interactions. Chymotrypsin is inhibited rapidly by ACT but forms relatively unstable complexes (19Cooperman B.S. Stravida E. Nickbarg E. Rescorla E. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23616-23625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the chymotrypsin-ACT complex located the protease near the site of encounter (9O'Malley K.M. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6631-6639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that inhibition of chymotrypsin by ACT may have RSL requirements different from those described by Zhouet al. (18Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The chymotrypsin-like protease, chymase, forms a stable complex with ACT but is inhibited slowly and with an unusually high apparent SI of 4 (20Schechter N.M. Slavin D. Fetter R.D. Lazarus G.L. Fraki J.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 232-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Schechter N.M. Jordan L.M. James A.M. Cooperman B.S. Wang Z.-m. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23626-23633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HNE is not inhibited by ACT even though the P1 residue is Leu-358. Rather, HNE cleaves the RSL of ACT at several different positions near the P1 site, thereby inactivating the inhibitor (17Rubin H. Plotnick M. Wang Z.-m. Liu X. Zhong Q. Schechter N.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7627-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We show that changing the reactive site by one residue in either direction has profound and different effects on all aspects of serpin protease reactions. The patterns observed were similar to those described by Zhou et al. (18Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that full insertion is a general requirement of protease inhibition by serpins. Peptide NA substrates were obtained from Bachem (Philadelphia, PA). HNE was obtained from Elastin Products (St. Louis, MO) or Athens Research Products (Athens, GA), and chymotrypsin was from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). Fast Q-, SP-, and heparin-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Gelcode Blue was from Pierce. -ACT and ACT variants were expressed in Escherichia coliand purified from the cellular supernatants (19Cooperman B.S. Stravida E. Nickbarg E. Rescorla E. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23616-23625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variants were produced by the overlap-extension PCR method of Ho et al.(22Ho S.N. Hunt R.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). To purify ACTs, supernatants were separated from cellular debris by centrifugation and then applied to a 50-ml Fast Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.05 mNaCl. The column was washed, and the serpin was eluted with a gradient of 0.05–0.4 m NaCl. All ACTs eluted at ∼0.3m NaCl. ACTs were identified by SDS-PAGE or by the inhibition of chymotrypsin. Fractionated ACT was then dialyzed overnight against 0.05 m NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 6.8) and applied to a 50-ml SP-Sepharose column. The column was eluted with a gradient of 0.05–0.4 m NaCl. ACT eluted at 0.2m NaCl. Fractions containing ACT were pooled, and solid NaCl was then added to a final concentration of 1.0 m NaCl. The preparation was then concentrated by pressure dialysis, dialyzed against 1.0 m NaCl, 0.01 m MOPS (pH 6.8), and stored at −80 °C. Human chymase was expressed as a pseudo-zymogen using a baculovirus-insect cell system and then purified as previously described (23Wang Z.M. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The primary structure of chymase differed from that of native chymase by three residues in positions that do not affect biochemical or structural properties (23Wang Z.M. Walter M. Selwood T. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Pereira P.J.B. Wang Z.-m. Rubin H. Huber R. Bode W. Schechter N.M. Strobl S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Concentrations of proteases were routinely determined by enzymatic assay under standard conditions using previously established specific activities. Values were 2.8, 3.0, and 0.60 μmol (min × nmol)−1 for chymase, chymotrypsin, and HNE, respectively. Standard assay conditions for chymase and chymotrypsin were 1 mm Suc-AAPF-NA, 1.8m NaCl, 0.45 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 9% Me2SO, 25 °C, and standard assay conditions for HNE were 1.0 mm MeO-Suc-AAPV-NA, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1m HEPES (pH 7.5), 9% Me2SO, 25 °C. The extinction coefficient for NA = 8800m−1cm−1. Concentrations of serpins were estimated by A280 nm assuming an extinction coefficient empirically determined as 45,000m−1 cm−1. SI values were determined by titration of protease activity. Titrations were performed by the addition of increasing amounts of inhibitor to a fixed amount of protease. Protease-inhibitor reactions were in a total volume of 25–50 μl of solution containing 0.5–1.0 μmprotease. Aliquots of 1–5 μl were typically removed for assay in 250–500 μl of substrate solution. The amount of protease in each aliquot was sufficient to produce a ΔA410 nm/min of 0.1–0.15 in the absence of inhibitor. Reactions of inhibitors with chymase, chymotrypsin, and HNE were performed at 25 °C in 1.0 m NaCl, 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, and 0.5m NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5) or 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, respectively. Inhibition rate constants were measured under pseudo-first order conditions, where [I]0 = [E]0 × SI × 10. Measurements were made using the progress curve method (25Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar) or by monitoring the time-dependent loss of activity. Incubation conditions were the same as those of titrations except for the presence of substrate (and final 9% Me2SO) in progress curve measurements. Chymase was measured using 0.5 mm Suc-AAPF-NA (Km = 0.8 mm) or 0.05 mSuc-AEPF-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Km = 0.5 mm). Chymotrypsin was measured using 0.1 mmSuc-AAPF-NA (Km = 0.05 μm). Elastase was measured in 1 mm MeO-Suc-AAPV-NA (Km= 0.15 μm). In the second method, used only for chymotrypsin, aliquots were removed, and residual activity was measured by dilution into assay media containing a saturating concentration of substrate. Rate constants for complex breakdown were determined by following the return of enzyme activity at 25 °C. Complexes were formed at high protease and serpin concentrations with the serpin in excess. Thus complex formation was rapid, and virtually all free enzyme was inhibited. These conditions limit proteolysis of the serpin-complexed protease; proteases inhibited by serpins may become highly sensitive to proteolysis by excess or exogenous protease (26Stavridi E.S.

Bálaint M. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Return of enzyme was monitored after a 250–500-fold dilution of the complex into a substrate-containing media. Breakdown of chymotrypsin-serpin complexes were monitored in a solution of 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, 9% Me2SO, 2 mm Suc-AAPF-NA (>20 ×Km), and breakdown of chymase-serpin complexes were in 1.0 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, 9% Me2SO, 1.0 mmSuc-AVPF-NA (7 × Km). Conversion of substrate to product was followed continuously for ∼18 h in a thermostatted spectrophotometer. Reactions were typically performed in a total volume of 25 μl, and proteins were resolved by discontinuous gel electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad mini gel system. 12% running gels were prepared according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed under the buffer conditions for titrations. Incubation times covered at least five half-lives, assuming second order conditions. Reactions were stopped by the addition of inhibitors PMSF or MeO-Suc-AAPV-chloromethyl ketone, and samples were denatured in an SDS-DTT solution with or without heating at 90 °C for 10 min. DTT was not used in the denaturation of chymotrypsin-serpin reactions; this omission prevents dissociation of chymotrypsin into its three peptide components. Protein bands were visualized employing Gelcode Blue. In certain studies, reactions were stopped instantaneously by the addition of trichloroacetic acid plus carrier RNA (10% final trichloroacetic acid concentration). Samples were allowed to precipitate in the cold for 1–2 h and then centrifuged to collect the precipitate. Precipitates were washed twice with ice-cold EtOH and then resolubilized in the SDS-DTT sample buffer and denatured by heating. Material analyzed was obtained from reactions containing excess inhibitor. In reactions that did not form stable complexes, PMSF or MeO-Suc-AAPV-chloromethyl ketone was added before complete consumption of the inhibitor to limit secondary cleavages. Residual intact inhibitor was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of aliquots removed from stopped reactions. Stoichiometries ([I]0/[E]0) for the reactions were as follows: chymase with rACT-RSP2 was 20 (chymase = 1.1 μm); chymase with rACT-RSP1′ was 29 (chymase = 0.8 μm); chymase with rACT and rACT-L361V was 5.5 (chymase = 2.8 μm); HNE with rACT-RSP1′ was 8 (HNE = 2.0 μm). Reactions contained an 8-fold excess of inhibitor in a solution of 0.1 m HEPES, 0.4 m NaCl, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside. After completion, products were denatured by SDS-DTT without heating and resolved on a 12% SDS gel. Bands were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The complex band was cut from the paper and subjected to 15 rounds of Edman degradation. Deconvolution of the data with knowledge of the full sequences of HNE and rACT-RSP1′ allowed for identification of the N termini of each protein and RSL cleavage sites. The above procedure for identifying the reactive site was based upon an empirical observation in this laboratory. We have found that protease-ACT complexes treated with SDS-DTT without heating retain a significant fraction of the serpin C-terminal fragment produced during complex formation. We suspect that this resistance to complete denaturation reflects the enhanced stability of serpins when the reactive site is cleaved. Data was analyzed using the fitting routines of Igor Pro from Wavemetrics. The RSL structure of ACT variants with reactive sites at the P2 position (16 residues from Glu-342) and the P1′ position (18 residues from Gly-342) are shown in Table I. The P2 reactive site variant, rACT-RSP2, was produced by mutating Leu-358 to Ser. This mutation makes Leu-357–Ser-358 the default reactive site. The P1′ reactive site variant rACT-RSP1′ was produced by replacing the sequence P2-P2′ of rACT by Ile-Thr-Leu-Ser. This relocates Leu to P1′ and maintains the sequence of the surrounding residues. As a result of these mutations, position 358 is either Ser or Thr and, therefore, should not be recognized.Table IReactive loop structure of rACT and variants with the reactive site relocated to either the P2 or P1′ positionSerpinReactive loop sequence342P1367rACTEEGTEASAATAVKITLLSALVETRTIrACT-RSP2SrACT-RSP1′ITLS Open table in a new tab The parameters, SI, kinh, and complex stability, describing the inhibition of chymase, chymotrypsin, and HNE with variants having the reactive site relocated to P2 or P1′ are reported in Table II.

The results show that each reactive site variant is functional, inhibiting at least one of the proteases being analyzed.

Open table in a new tab Titrations of chymotrypsin and chymase hydrolytic activity by rACT-RSP2 and chymotrypsin hydrolytic activity by rACT are shown in Fig. 1A. All titrations demonstrated a linear loss of hydrolytic activity; only the chymotrypsin-rACT titration extrapolated to an end point consistent with an SI of 1. Endpoints for the inhibition of chymotrypsin and chymase by rACT-RSP2 were at [I]0/E]0 values of 3 and 12, respectively, Both SI values are significantly higher than 1 and 4, observed for the inhibition of each protease by rACT (Table II). SIs > 1 are due to the degradation of the inhibitor by a reaction in competition with the inhibition reaction. SDS-PAGE analysis of the reaction of rACT-RSP2 with chymase (panels A and B) and chymotrypsin (panel C) are shown in Fig. 2. Lane 1 in each gel is the control, demonstrating the migration of active inhibitor (I) and PMSF-inhibited protease.Lanes 2–4 show the banding patterns of reactions produced at [I]0/E]0 that range from below to above the SI established by titration. Bands consistent with the formation of covalent (1:1) protease-serpin complex (CM) are evident in reactions where [I]0/E]0 ≥ SI. When [I]0/E]0 is below the SI (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 2), degradation of the protease-serpin complex is observed to variable degrees. Degradation is due to proteolysis of the complex, protease, and/or serpin components by excess protease. Such proteolysis does not result in the release of active protease (21Schechter N.M.

The patterns of protease disappearance (chymase or chymotrypsin) and that of intact inhibitor appearance over the [I]0/E]0 range reflect the high SI values observed for each protease in titrations. Cleaved serpin (CL) is a consequence of the cleavage pathway producing SI > 1. The relative staining intensities of the complex and cleaved inhibitor bands also are consistent with the high SI values. The close migration of intact and cleaved inhibitor in gels A and C indicate a minimal difference in mass. The small difference is consistent with hydrolysis within the RSL located in all serpins ∼40–50 residues from the C terminus. Gels A and B represent the same chymase-rACT-RSP2 reaction, only differing in the temperature used for SDS denaturation. Gel B, in which SDS denaturation is performed at 25–37 °C instead of 90–100 °C, shows enhanced resolution of cleaved and intact inhibitor bands. The better separation confirms the extraordinarily high SI for the chymase-rACT-RSP2 reaction. The enhanced resolution is likely related to incomplete denaturation of cleaved inhibitor due to the greater structural stability of this serpin form (30Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Carrell R.W. Evans D.I.I. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Sites of RSL cleavage were identified by MALDI-MS. This technique can be used to measure the mass of the 4–5-kDa C-terminal fragment generated in production of serpin-protease complex and cleaved serpin (29Plotnick M.I. Schechter N.M. Wang Z.M.

In Table III, the size of the C-terminal fragment(s) produced in the reactions of chymase with rACT, a P3′ variant of rACT, and rACT-RSP2 are reported. Experimentally determined masses are reported below the closest mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. The cleavage products formed in the chymase-rACT and chymase-rACT-L361V reactions indicate two primary sites of encounter at the P1 and P2 residues of the RSL. A potential chymase cleavage site at P3′-P4′ does not appear to be a primary site because its removal does not affect the SI (Table III). The only fragment detected for the chymase-rACT-RSP2 reaction corresponds to cleavage between Leu-357–Ser-358, defining this site as both the reactive site and the cleavage site producing the SI > 1. Given the similar substrate specificity of chymase and chymotrypsin, exclusive interaction with the P2 site also likely explains the SI inc"
