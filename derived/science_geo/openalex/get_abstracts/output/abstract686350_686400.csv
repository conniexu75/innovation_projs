https://openalex.org/W4205677193,"Microbial communities might include distinct lineages of closely related organisms that complicate metagenomic assembly and prevent the generation of complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Here we show that deep sequencing using long (HiFi) reads combined with Hi-C binning can address this challenge even for complex microbial communities. Using existing methods, we sequenced the sheep fecal metagenome and identified 428 MAGs with more than 90% completeness, including 44 MAGs in single circular contigs. To resolve closely related strains (lineages), we developed MAGPhase, which separates lineages of related organisms by discriminating variant haplotypes across hundreds of kilobases of genomic sequence. MAGPhase identified 220 lineage-resolved MAGs in our dataset. The ability to resolve closely related microbes in complex microbial communities improves the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters and the precision of assigning mobile genetic elements to host genomes. We identified 1,400 complete and 350 partial biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which are novel, as well as 424 (298) potential host–viral (host–plasmid) associations using Hi-C data. Metagenome sequencing can now distinguish closely related microbes using long reads and haplotype phasing."

https://openalex.org/W4206812307,"β-Thalassemias are inherited anemias that are caused by the absent or insufficient production of the β chain of hemoglobin. Here we report 6–8-year follow-up of four adult patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia who were infused with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the TNS9.3.55 lentiviral globin vector after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) in a phase 1 clinical trial ( NCT01639690) . Patients were monitored for insertional mutagenesis and the generation of a replication-competent lentivirus (safety and tolerability of the infusion product after RIC—primary endpoint) and engraftment of genetically modified autologous CD34+ cells, expression of the transduced β-globin gene and post-transplant transfusion requirements (efficacy—secondary endpoint). No unexpected safety issues occurred during conditioning and cell product infusion. Hematopoietic gene marking was very stable but low, reducing transfusion requirements in two patients, albeit not achieving transfusion independence. Our findings suggest that non-myeloablative conditioning can achieve durable stem cell engraftment but underscore a minimum CD34+ cell transduction requirement for effective therapy. Moderate clonal expansions were associated with integrations near cancer-related genes, suggestive of non-erythroid activity of globin vectors in stem/progenitor cells. These correlative findings highlight the necessity of cautiously monitoring patients harboring globin vectors. A gene therapy phase 1 trial in patients with β-thalassemia shows transplantation of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with a lentiviral globin vector after reduced-intensity conditioning achieves long-term engraftment, albeit not transfusion independence, with benign clonal expansions, warranting cautious monitoring of patients."
https://openalex.org/W4200395327,"The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is an inner mitochondrial membrane complex that plays a critical role in intermediary metabolism. Inhibition of the MPC, especially in liver, may have efficacy for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein, we examined the antidiabetic effects of zaprinast and 7ACC2, small molecules which have been reported to act as MPC inhibitors. Both compounds activated a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based MPC reporter assay (reporter sensitive to pyruvate) and potently inhibited pyruvate-mediated respiration in isolated mitochondria. Furthermore, zaprinast and 7ACC2 acutely improved glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice in vivo. Although some findings were suggestive of improved insulin sensitivity, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies did not detect enhanced insulin action in response to 7ACC2 treatment. Rather, our data suggest acute glucose-lowering effects of MPC inhibition may be due to suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis. Finally, we used reporter sensitive to pyruvate to screen a chemical library of drugs and identified 35 potentially novel MPC modulators. Using available evidence, we generated a pharmacophore model to prioritize which hits to pursue. Our analysis revealed carsalam and six quinolone antibiotics, as well as 7ACC1, share a common pharmacophore with 7ACC2. We validated that these compounds are novel inhibitors of the MPC and suppress hepatocyte glucose production and demonstrated that one quinolone (nalidixic acid) improved glucose tolerance in obese mice. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic targeting of the MPC for treating diabetes and provide scaffolds that can be used to develop potent and novel classes of MPC inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4205687290,"GAPDH, a heme chaperone, has been previously implicated in the incorporation of heme into iNOS and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Since sGC is critical for myoglobin (Mb) heme-maturation, we investigated the role of GAPDH in the maturation of this globin, as well as hemoglobins α, β, and γ. Utilizing cell culture systems, we found that overexpression of wild-type GAPDH increased, whereas GAPDH mutants H53A and K227A decreased, the heme content of Mb and Hbα and Hbβ. Overexpression of wild-type GAPDH fully recovered the heme-maturation inhibition observed with the GAPDH mutants. Partial rescue was observed by overexpression of sGCβ1 but not by overexpression of a sGCΔβ1 deletion mutant, which is unable to bind the sGCα1 subunit required to form the active sGCα1β1 complex. Wild type and mutant GAPDH was found to be associated in a complex with each of the globins and Hsp90. GAPDH at endogenous levels was found to be associated with Mb in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, and with Hbγ or Hbα in differentiating HiDEP-1 erythroid progenitor cells. Knockdown of GAPDH in C2C12 cells suppressed Mb heme-maturation. GAPDH knockdown in K562 erythroleukemia cells suppressed Hbα and Hbγ heme-maturation as well as Hb dimerization. Globin heme incorporation was not only dependent on elevated sGCα1β1 heterodimer formation, but also influenced by iron provision and magnitude of expression of GAPDH, d-aminolevulinic acid, and FLVCR1b. Together, our data support an important role for GAPDH in the maturation of myoglobin and γ, β, and α hemoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W4206534973,"Genomic loss of RB1 is a common alteration in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and is associated with poor patient outcomes. RB1 loss is also a critical event that promotes the neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer (PCa) induced by the androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibition (ARSi). The loss of Rb protein disrupts the Rb-E2F repressor complex and thus hyperactivates E2F transcription activators. While the impact of Rb inactivation on PCa progression and linage plasticity has been previously studied, there is a pressing need to fully understand underlying mechanisms and identify vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted in Rb-deficient CRPC. Using an integrated cistromic and transcriptomic analysis, we have characterized Rb activities in multiple CRPC models by identifying Rb-directly regulated genes and revealed that Rb has distinct binding sites and targets in CRPC with different genomic backgrounds. Significantly, we show that E2F1 chromatin binding and transcription activity in Rb-deficient CRPC are highly dependent on LSD1/KDM1A, and that Rb inactivation sensitizes CRPC tumor to the LSD1 inhibitor treatment. These results provide new molecular insights into Rb activity in PCa progression and suggest that targeting LSD1 activity with small molecule inhibitors may be a potential treatment strategy to treat Rb-deficient CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W4200335360,"The breakdown of all-trans-retinal (atRAL) clearance is closely associated with photoreceptor cell death in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and autosomal recessive Stargardt's disease (STGD1), but its mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that activation of gasdermin E (GSDME) but not gasdermin D promotes atRAL-induced photoreceptor damage by activating pyroptosis and aggravating apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated caspase-3-dependent signaling pathway. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase was identified as one of the major causes of mitochondrial membrane rupture in atRAL-loaded photoreceptor cells, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, where it stimulated caspase-3 activation required for cleavage of GSDME. Aggregation of the N-terminal fragment of GSDME in the mitochondria revealed that GSDME was likely to penetrate mitochondrial membranes in photoreceptor cells after atRAL exposure. ABC (subfamily A, member 4) and all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase 8 are two key proteins responsible for clearing atRAL in the retina. Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice exhibit serious defects in atRAL clearance upon light exposure and serve as an acute model for dry AMD and STGD1. We found that N-terminal fragment of GSDME was distinctly localized in the photoreceptor outer nuclear layer of light-exposed Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice. Of note, degeneration and caspase-3 activation in photoreceptors were significantly alleviated in Abca4-/-Rdh8-/-Gsdme-/- mice after exposure to light. The results of this study indicate that GSDME is a common causative factor of photoreceptor pyroptosis and apoptosis arising from atRAL overload, suggesting that repressing GSDME may represent a potential treatment of photoreceptor atrophy in dry AMD and STGD1."
https://openalex.org/W4206393763,"Background People who were born prematurely have high risks of many individual diseases and conditions in the early part of the life course. However, our knowledge of the burden of multiple diseases (multimorbidity) among prematurely born individuals is limited. We aimed to investigate the risk and patterns of chronic disease multimorbidity in adolescence and early adulthood among individuals born across the spectrum of gestational ages, comparing preterm and full-term born individuals. Methods and findings We used individual-level data from linked nationwide registers to examine the associations of gestational age at birth with specialised healthcare records of ≥2 chronic diseases (multimorbidity) in adolescence (age 10–17 years) and early adulthood (age 18–30 years). Our study population comprised 951,116 individuals (50.2% females) born alive in Finland between 1 st January 1987 and 31 st December 2006, inclusive. All individuals were followed from age 10 years to the onset of multimorbidity, emigration, death, or 31 December 2016 (up to age 30 years). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for multimorbidity using flexible parametric survival models. During 6,417,903 person-years at risk (median follow-up: 7.9 years), 11,919 individuals (1.3%) had multimorbidity in adolescence (18.6 per 10,000 person-years). During 3,967,419 person-years at risk (median follow-up: 6.2 years), 15,664 individuals (1.7%) had multimorbidity in early adulthood (39.5 per 10,000 person-years). Adjusted HRs for adolescent multimorbidity, comparing preterm to full-term born individuals, were 1.29 (95% CI: 1.22 to 1.36) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.18 to 1.35) in females and males, respectively. The associations of preterm birth with early adult multimorbidity were less marked, with the adjusted HRs indicating 1.18-fold risk in females (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.24) and 1.10-fold risk in males (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.17). We observed a consistent dose-response relationship between earlier gestational age at birth and increasing risks of both multimorbidity outcomes. Compared to full-term born males, those born at 37–38 weeks (early term) had a 1.06-fold risk of multimorbidity in adolescence (95% CI: 0.98 to 1.14) and this risk increased in a graded manner up to 6.85-fold (95% CI: 5.39 to 8.71) in those born at 23–27 weeks (extremely premature), independently of covariates. Among females, the same risks ranged from 1.16-fold (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.23) among those born at 37–38 weeks to 5.65-fold (95% CI: 4.45 to 7.18) among those born at 23–27 weeks. The corresponding risks of early adult multimorbidity were similar in direction but less marked in magnitude, with little difference in risks between males and females born at 36–37 weeks but up to 3-fold risks observed among those born at 23–27 weeks. Conclusions Our findings indicate that an earlier gestational age at birth is associated with increased risks of chronic disease multimorbidity in the early part of the life course. There are currently no clinical guidelines for follow-up of prematurely born individuals beyond childhood, but these observations suggest that information on gestational age would be a useful characteristic to include in a medical history when assessing the risk of multiple chronic diseases in adolescent and young adult patients."
https://openalex.org/W4205939716,"Nerve growth factor-induced gene B (Nur77) has been shown to ameliorate several biological processes in chronic diseases, including inflammatory response, cellular proliferation, and metabolism. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by tubulointerstitial fibrosis for which no targeted therapies are available as yet. In this study, we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to demonstrate that Nur77 targets fibrosis signals and attenuates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis during the aging process. We observed that the TGF-β/Smads signal pathway was significantly suppressed by Nur77, suggesting that Nur77 controlled the activation of key steps in TGF-β/Smads signaling. We further showed that Nur77 interacted with Smad7, the main repressor of nuclear translocation of Smad2/3, and stabilized Smad7 protein homeostasis. Nur77 deficiency resulted in Smad7 degradation, aggravating Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and promoting transcription of its downstream target genes, ACTA2 and collagen I. Our findings demonstrate that Nur77 is a potential therapeutic target for age-related kidney diseases including CKD. Maintenance of Nur77 may be an effective strategy for blocking renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and improving renal function in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W4200082358,"Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a vertebrate protein, normally found within the presynaptic nerve terminal and nucleus, which is known to form somatic and neuritic aggregates in certain neurodegenerative diseases. Disease-associated aggregates of aSyn are heavily phosphorylated at serine-129 (pSyn), while normal aSyn protein is not. Within the nucleus, aSyn can directly bind DNA, but the mechanism of binding and the potential modulatory roles of phosphorylation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate using a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assay and atomic force microscopy approaches that both aSyn and pSyn can bind DNA within the major groove, in a DNA length-dependent manner and with little specificity for DNA sequence. Our data are consistent with a model in which multiple aSyn molecules bind a single 300 base pair (bp) DNA molecule in such a way that stabilizes the DNA in a bent conformation. We propose that serine-129 phosphorylation decreases the ability of aSyn to both bind and bend DNA, as aSyn binds 304 bp circular DNA forced into a bent shape, but pSyn does not. Two aSyn paralogs, beta- and gamma-synuclein, also interact with DNA differently than aSyn, and do not stabilize similar DNA conformations. Our work suggests that reductions in aSyn’s ability to bind and bend DNA induced by serine-129 phosphorylation may be important for modulating aSyn’s known roles in DNA metabolism, including the regulation of transcription and DNA repair.

It is through these interactions with neurotransmitter vesicles that aSyn is thought to mediate its presynaptic functions. In addition to its functions in the presynaptic terminal, aSyn can also localize to the nucleus where it is less well studied but has been suggested to modulate several DNA- and RNA-dependent processes. These include regulation of histone modification (4Goers J. Manning-Bog A.B. McCormack A.L. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Di Monte D.A. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L.

Our recent work also suggests a previously unrecognized role for aSyn in modulating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (9Schaser A.J. Osterberg V.R. Dent S.E. Stackhouse T.L. Wakeham C.M.

Alpha-synuclein is a DNA binding protein that modulates DNA repair with implications for Lewy body disorders.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 10919Google Scholar). Many of these potential functions are dependent on aSyn’s ability to bind double-stranded nucleic acids, including DNA. Early work demonstrated that aSyn can bind DNA in its supercoiled form (47Hegde M.L. Jagannatha Rao K.S.

NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that the same N-terminal domain that binds curved, negatively charged phospholipid membranes mediates aSyn’s binding to the phosphate backbone of DNA (7Pinho R. Paiva I.

Single-molecule techniques have shown that aSyn binding can stretch DNA and increase its stiffness (51Jiang K. Rocha S. Westling A. Kesarimangalam S. Dorfman K.D. Wittung-Stafshede P. Westerlund F.

Biol. 2021; 2: 1196-1200Google Scholar). Although this work has started to reveal the mechanism of aSyn binding to DNA, important questions remain, including the role of potential disease-relevant aSyn posttranslational modifications in this process. Phosphorylation of aSyn at serine-129 (pSyn) is a well-established marker of pathological forms of aSyn aggregates. While <4% of aSyn is phosphorylated at this site in normal brain, within Lewy bodies >90% of aSyn bears this posttranslational modification (55Anderson J.P. Walker D.E. Goldstein J.M. de Laat R. Banducci K. Caccavello R.J. Barbour R. Huang J. Kling K. Lee M. Diep L. Keim P.S. Shen X. Chataway T. Schlossmacher M.G. et al.Phosphorylation of Ser-129 is the dominant pathological modification of alpha-synuclein in familial and sporadic Lewy body disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29739-29752Google Scholar). In addition, human autopsy studies have shown that pSyn is the most sensitive immunohistochemical marker yet developed to detect Lewy body pathology (56Beach T.G. White C.L. Hamilton R.L. Duda J.E. Iwatsubo T. Dickson D.W. Leverenz J.B. Roncaroli F. Buttini M. Hladik C.L. Sue L.I. Noorigian J.V. Adler C.H. Evaluation of alpha-synuclein immunohistochemical methods used by invited experts.Acta Neuropathol. 2008; 116: 277-288Google Scholar). Although pSyn may be important for disease pathogenesis, and previous work suggests that aSyn phosphorylation can modulate its nuclear localization (7Pinho R. Paiva I. Jercic K.G. Fonseca-Ornelas L. Gerhardt E. Fahlbusch C. Garcia-Esparcia P. Kerimoglu C. Pavlou M.A. Villar-Pique A. Szego É. Lopes da Fonseca T. Odoardi F. Soeroes S.

Tobias Z.J.C. Osterberg V.R. Brockway N.L. Pizano S. Glover G. Weissman T.A. Unni V.K. In vivo aggregation of presynaptic alpha-synuclein is not influenced by its phosphorylation at serine-129.Neurobiol. Dis. 2021; 152: 105291Google Scholar), little is known about how this phosphorylation may affect aSyn’s DNA-binding properties. Our previous work suggested that both aSyn and pSyn can bind DNA directly, but that phosphorylation can alter the nature of this interaction in potentially important ways (9Schaser A.J. Osterberg V.R. Dent S.E. Stackhouse T.L. Wakeham C.M. Boutros S.W. Weston L.J. Owen N. Weissman T.A. Luna E. Raber J. Luk K.C. McCullough A.K. Woltjer R.L. Unni V.K. Alpha-synuclein is a DNA binding protein that modulates DNA repair with implications for Lewy body disorders.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 10919Google Scholar). Given that a detailed understanding of how these two synuclein forms interact with DNA is still lacking, here we set out to test the properties of DNA that are important for aSyn binding and how serine-129 phosphorylation could modulate synuclein–DNA interactions. Our previous work has shown that both aSyn and pSyn can bind 300 bp double-stranded DNA, but that aSyn produced multiple bound states, while pSyn produced only a single bound state under the conditions tested (9Schaser A.J. Osterberg V.R. Dent S.E. Stackhouse T.L. Wakeham C.M. Boutros S.W. Weston L.J. Owen N. Weissman T.A. Luna E. Raber J. Luk K.C. McCullough A.K. Woltjer R.L. Unni V.K. Alpha-synuclein is a DNA binding protein that modulates DNA repair with implications for Lewy body disorders.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 10919Google Scholar). To better understand this differential binding of aSyn and pSyn to DNA, we tested the ability of each synuclein to bind DNA of different lengths. We found that both aSyn and pSyn bind double-stranded DNA in a length-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Increasing concentrations of synuclein incubated with a ladder containing DNA of various lengths and analyzed using a 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) system demonstrated that both proteins show little obvious interaction with DNA that is ≤200 bp in length, while longer DNAs are bound and shifted upward. Close examination of this shift due to synuclein binding revealed that at a given synuclein concentration, all DNA lengths above a certain critical length were bound and shifted upward, while below this critical length DNA was unbound, and there was no shift in these bands, and the DNA band in between these two lengths (at or near the critical length) exhibited both shifted (bound) and unshifted (unbound) bands (Fig. 1A). The value of these critical lengths, where the DNA exhibited both shifted and unshifted bands, decreased with increasing synuclein concentration. aSyn produced a range of bound states and, therefore, smearing of the signal at higher DNA lengths obscured the changes occurring to specific bands in the aSyn EMSA. This smearing did not occur with pSyn. This is consistent with our previous work showing that aSyn binding to 300 bp DNA produced a laddering effect due to the presence of multiple shifted bound states of different apparent lengths, while pSyn only produced a single shifted bound state (9Schaser A.J. Osterberg V.R. Dent S.E. Stackhouse T.L. Wakeham C.M. Boutros S.W. Weston L.J. Owen N. Weissman T.A. Luna E. Raber J. Luk K.C. McCullough A.K. Woltjer R.L. Unni V.K. Alpha-synuclein is a DNA binding protein that modulates DNA repair with implications for Lewy body disorders.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 10919Google Scholar). To understand the DNA length dependence of these band shifts better, without the complication of multiple-length DNA fragments in the same lane, we performed similar EMSAs using DNA of only a single length, ranging from 125 to 500 bp. These experiments also showed a clear length dependence to aSyn and pSyn DNA binding, with aSyn binding DNA better than pSyn at DNA lengths between 125 and 300 bp (Fig. 1B). The Hill slopes for binding of aSyn and pSyn were both positive, suggesting cooperative binding interactions between both synuclein forms and DNA, although we did not detect significant differences in the amount of cooperativity between aSyn or pSyn binding DNA. Given the relative simplicity of interpreting mobility changes with pSyn, due to the lack of smearing at high apparent DNA lengths, we also tested the ability of pSyn to shift ladder DNA under different gel conditions. We saw similar upward shifts of all DNA fragments above a certain critical length, no change below this critical length, and partial binding at or near these critical lengths when performing EMSAs with polyacrylamide gel concentrations ranging between 6 and 20% (Fig. S1A). To assay binding of aSyn to 300 bp DNA using another parallel technique to EMSA, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) on surfaces where DNA was applied either without aSyn or in the presence of 57 μM aSyn, a concentration where we measure robust aSyn-DNA binding in our EMSA experiments. These AFM data show evidence of increased apparent DNA thickness and a globular protein signal bound to 300 bp DNA in the condition where aSyn is present (Fig. S1B), suggesting that aSyn does bind 300 bp double-stranded DNA, as previous AFM studies have shown with longer DNA molecules (51Jiang K. Rocha S. Westling A. Kesarimangalam S. Dorfman K.D. Wittung-Stafshede P. Westerlund F. Alpha-synuclein modulates the physical properties of DNA.Chemistry. 2018; 24: 15685-15690Google Scholar). The physiologically and pathologically relevant conformations of aSyn are subject to debate, and questions remain about the role/s of the unfolded monomeric state (59Lashuel H.A. Overk C.R.

Humans express two isoforms of HO: the inducible HO-1, which is upregulated in response to excess heme and other stressors, and the constitutive HO-2. Much is known about the regulation and physiological function of HO-1, whereas comparatively little is known about the role of HO-2 in regulating heme homeostasis. The biochemical necessity for expressing constitutive HO-2 is dependent on whether heme is sufficiently abundant and accessible as a substrate under conditions in which HO-1 is not induced. By measuring labile heme, total heme, and bilirubin in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells with silenced or overexpressed HO-2, as well as various HO-2 mutant alleles, we found that endogenous heme is too limiting a substrate to observe HO-2-dependent heme degradation. Rather, we discovered a novel role for HO-2 in the binding and buffering of heme. Taken together, in the absence of excess heme, we propose that HO-2 regulates heme homeostasis by acting as a heme buffering factor that controls heme bioavailability. When heme is in excess, HO-1 is induced, and both HO-2 and HO-1 can provide protection from heme toxicity via enzymatic degradation. Our results explain why catalytically inactive mutants of HO-2 are cytoprotective against oxidative stress. Moreover, the change in bioavailable heme due to HO-2 overexpression, which selectively binds ferric over ferrous heme, is consistent with labile heme being oxidized, thereby providing new insights into heme trafficking and signaling.

HOs, which are primarily anchored into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and whose active sites face the cytoplasm, bind oxidized ferric heme in its resting state using a histidine axial ligand. Upon reduction, using electrons from the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) system and dioxygen binding (O2), HOs catalyze the oxidative degradation of heme to form biliverdin, ferrous iron (Fe2+), and carbon monoxide (CO) (40Trakshel G.M.

The current rationale for dual mammalian HO isoforms is that HO-2 provides a baseline level of protection from heme in the absence of cellular stressors that would otherwise induce HO-1. However, the biochemical necessity for expressing constitutive HO-2 is largely dependent on whether sufficient heme is available as a substrate under conditions in which HO-1 is not induced.

Labile heme may act as a reservoir for bioavailable heme that can readily exchange with and populate heme-binding sites in heme dependent or regulated enzymes and proteins. The nature of LH, including its speciation, oxidation state, concentration, and distribution are not well understood but may be relevant for the mobilization and trafficking of heme. It is currently not known what the source of heme is for HOs, that is, whether it is buffered-free heme or a dedicated chaperone system that traffics and channels heme to HO in a manner that bypasses the LH pool. The recent development of fluorescence and activity-based heme sensors has offered unprecedented insights into LH and their diverse roles in physiology (63Hanna D.A. Harvey R.M. Martinez-Guzman O.

The final frontier of pH and the undiscovered country beyond.PLoS One. 2012; 7e45832Google Scholar). In other words, the heme occupancy of the sensor is dictated by the extent to which LH can exchange with the probe. However, many investigators convert the fractional heme loading of a probe to a buffered-free heme concentration, which can be done if the heme-sensor dissociation constant is known. Although problematic in that the sensor may not be probing “free heme”, it nonetheless provides a measure of labile or accessible heme because the calculated concentration of free heme is related to sensor heme occupancy. In intact living yeast and various nonerythroid human cell lines, the estimates of buffered-free heme based on genetically encoded heme sensors are on the order of ∼5 to 20 nM (63Hanna D.A.

https://openalex.org/W4206198188,"Trichoderma atroviride (Ascomycota, Sordariomycetes) is a well-known mycoparasite applied for protecting plants against fungal pathogens. Its mycoparasitic activity involves processes shared with plant and human pathogenic fungi such as the production of cell wall degrading enzymes and secondary metabolites and is tightly regulated by environmental cues. In eukaryotes, the conserved Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase serves as a central regulator of cellular growth in response to nutrient availability. Here we describe how alteration of the activity of TOR1, the single and essential TOR kinase of T. atroviride, by treatment with chemical TOR inhibitors or by genetic manipulation of selected TOR pathway components affected various cellular functions. Loss of TSC1 and TSC2, that are negative regulators of TOR complex 1 (TORC1) in mammalian cells, resulted in altered nitrogen source-dependent growth of T. atroviride, reduced mycoparasitic overgrowth and, in the case of Δtsc1, a diminished production of numerous secondary metabolites. Deletion of the gene encoding the GTPase RHE2, whose mammalian orthologue activates mTORC1, led to rapamycin hypersensitivity and altered secondary metabolism, but had an only minor effect on vegetative growth and mycoparasitic overgrowth. The latter also applied to mutants missing the npr1-1 gene that encodes a fungus-specific kinase known as TOR target in yeast. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis confirmed TOR1 as a regulatory hub that governs T. atroviride metabolism and processes associated to ribosome biogenesis, gene expression and translation. In addition, mycoparasitism-relevant genes encoding terpenoid and polyketide synthases, peptidases, glycoside hydrolases, small secreted cysteine-rich proteins, and G protein coupled receptors emerged as TOR1 targets. Our results provide the first in-depth insights into TOR signaling in a fungal mycoparasite and emphasize its importance in the regulation of processes that critically contribute to the antagonistic activity of T. atroviride."
https://openalex.org/W4206931563,"Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania and is known to affect millions of individuals worldwide. In recent years, we have established the critical role played by Leishmania zinc-metalloprotease GP63 in the modulation of host macrophage signalling and functions, favouring its survival and progression within its host. Leishmania major lacking GP63 was reported to cause limited infection in mice, however, it is still unclear how GP63 may influence the innate inflammatory response and parasite survival in an in vivo context. Therefore, we were interested in analyzing the early innate inflammatory events upon Leishmania inoculation within mice and establish whether Leishmania GP63 influences this initial inflammatory response. Experimentally, L. major WT (L. majorWT), L. major GP63 knockout (L. majorKO), or L. major GP63 rescue (L. majorR) were intraperitoneally inoculated in mice and the inflammatory cells recruited were characterized microscopically and by flow cytometry (number and cell type), and their infection determined. Pro-inflammatory markers such as cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles (EVs, e.g. exosomes) were monitored and proteomic analysis was performed on exosome contents. Data obtained from this study suggest that Leishmania GP63 does not significantly influence the pathogen-induced inflammatory cell recruitment, but rather their activation status and effector function. Concordantly, internalization of promastigotes during early infection could be influenced by GP63 as fewer L. majorKO amastigotes were found within host cells and appear to maintain in host cells over time. Collectively this study provides a clear analysis of innate inflammatory events occurring during L. major infection and further establish the prominent role of the virulence factor GP63 to provide favourable conditions for host cell infection."
https://openalex.org/W4206958768,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) in resource-limited settings are vulnerable to malnutrition. Nutritional interventions aimed at improving food insecurity and malnutrition, together with antiretroviral therapy (ART), could improve treatment outcomes. In Nigeria, there is a high awareness of the nutraceutical benefits of Moringa oleifera. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of Moringa oleifera leaf supplementation on the CD4 counts, viral load and anthropometric of HIV-positive adults on ART.This was a double-blind, randomized study. Two hundred HIV-positive patients were randomly allocated to either the Moringa Oleifera group (MOG) given Moringa oleifera leaf powder or the control group (COG) given a placebo. Changes in anthropometric parameters [weight; body mass index (BMI)] and CD4 cell counts were measured monthly for six months, while HIV-1 viral loads were measured at baseline and the end of the study for both groups.Over the study period, the treatment by time interaction shows a significant difference in CD4 counts by treatment group (p<0.0001). A further estimate of fixed effects showed that the CD4 counts among MOG were 10.33 folds greater than COG over the study period. However, the viral load (p = 0.9558) and all the anthropometric parameters (weight; p = 0.5556 and BMI; p = 0.5145) between the two groups were not significantly different over time. All tests were conducted at 95CI.This study revealed that Moringa oleifera leaf supplementation was associated with increased CD4 cell counts of PLHIV on ART in a resource-limited setting. Programs in low-resource settings, such as Nigeria, should consider nutritional supplementation as part of a comprehensive approach to ensure optimal treatment outcomes in PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W4205160379,"Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Alsever's solution (AS) are frequently used as media in blood-related studies, while 0.9% normal saline (NS) is frequently used in transfusion medicine. Despite the frequent use, the effects of these solutions on the shape and volume of red blood cells (RBCs) have not been reported. We collected blood samples from five healthy adults and used three-dimensional refractive index tomography to investigate the changes in the morphology of RBCs caused by changes in osmolality and solutes at the single-cell level. After diluting 2 μL of RBCs 200-fold with each solution (PBS, AS, and 0.9% NS), 40 randomly selected RBCs were microscopically observed. RBC shape was measured considering sphericity, which is a dimensionless quantity ranging from 0 (flat) to 1 (spherical). RBCs in plasma or AS showed a biconcave shape with a small sphericity, whereas those in 0.9% NS or PBS showed a spherical shape with a large sphericity. Moreover, we confirmed that sodium chloride alone could not elicit the biconcave shape of RBCs, which could be maintained only in the presence of an osmotic pressure-maintaining substance, such as glucose or mannitol. Although 0.9% NS solution is one of the most commonly used fluids in hematology and transfusion medicine, RBCs in 0.9% NS or PBS are not biconcave. Therefore, as the debate on the use of NS continues, future clinical studies or applications should consider the effect of glucose or mannitol on the shape of RBCs."

https://openalex.org/W4226180174,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are able to undergo both self-renewal and differentiation. Unlike self-renewal, which replenishes the SSC and progenitor pool, differentiation is an irreversible process committing cells to meiosis. Although the preparations for meiotic events in differentiating spermatogonia (Di-SG) are likely to be accompanied by alterations in chromatin structure, the three-dimensional chromatin architectural differences between SSCs and Di-SG, and the higher-order chromatin dynamics during spermatogonial differentiation, have not been systematically investigated. Here, we performed in situ high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, RNA-seq, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses on porcine undifferentiated spermatogonia (which consist of SSCs and progenitors) and Di-SG. We identified that Di-SG exhibited less compact chromatin structural organization, weakened compartmentalization, and diminished topologically associating domains in comparison with undifferentiated spermatogonia, suggesting that diminished higher-order chromatin architecture in meiotic cells, as shown by recent reports, might be preprogrammed in Di-SG. Our data also revealed that A/B compartments, representing open or closed chromatin regions respectively, and topologically associating domains were related to dynamic gene expression during spermatogonial differentiation. Furthermore, we unraveled the contribution of promoter-enhancer interactions to premeiotic transcriptional regulation, which has not been accomplished in previous studies due to limited cell input and resolution. Together, our study uncovered the three-dimensional chromatin structure of SSCs/progenitors and Di-SG, as well as the interplay between higher-order chromatin architecture and dynamic gene expression during spermatogonial differentiation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms for SSC self-renewal and differentiation and have implications for diagnosis and treatment of male sub-/infertility."

In developing countries, the supplementation of vitamins under a regular schedule had different constraints. Awareness, access, and resource limitations were usually the problem. In the current study, we analyzed the data from the demographic health survey (EDHS) 2016 to uncover the spatial distribution, predictors, and to provide additional information for policymaking and interventions.In this analysis, we applied intra-community correlation to measure the random effect; global Moran's I to test the nature of variance in the null model; proportional change in variance to check the variance of null and neighborhood in subsequent models. We used STATA 15 for prediction; ArcGIS 10.7 for the spatial distribution of vitamin A supplementation; SaTscan 9.6.1 to specify location of clustering were the applied soft wares. After confirming that the traditional logistic regression cannot explore the variances, we applied multilevel logistic regression to examine predictors where p-value <0.25 was used to include variables into the model and p-value<0.05 was used to declare associations. We presented the result using means, standard deviations, numbers, and proportions or percent, and AOR with 95% CI.The vitamin A coverage was 4,029.22 (44.90%) in Ethiopia in 2016. The distribution followed some spatial geo-locations where Afar, Somali were severely affected (RR = 1.46, P-value < 0.001), some pockets of Addis Ababa (RR = 1.47, p-value <0.001), and the poor distribution also affected all other regions partially. Place of delivery 1.2(1-1.34), primary and secondary education 1.3 (1-1.6), media exposure 1.2(1.1-1.4), having work 1.4(1.2-1.5), and all visits of ANC were positively influenced the distribution.The distribution of vitamin A coverage was not random as per the EDHS 2016 data. Regions like Afar, Somali, and some pocket areas in Addis inquires immediate interventions. Pastoralist, agrarian, and city administrations were all involved from severe to the lesser coverage in order. Since factors like Place of delivery, education, ANC, media exposure, and having work were showed positive associations, interventions considering awareness, access, and availability of service need more attention than ever."
https://openalex.org/W4205745485,"VOHO Hemp Oil (Verdant Nature LLC (in collaboration with HempFusion)) is an extract of the aerial parts of hemp (Cannabis sativa L) manufactured using a supercritical CO2 extraction process. The results of four safety studies are reported here including a bacterial reverse mutation assay, an in vivo mammalian micronucleus study, a maximum tolerated dose study in rats and a 90-day repeat dose subchronic toxicity study in rats. VOHO Hemp oil can contain up to 30% phytocannabinoids and less than 0.2% is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). VOHO Hemp Oil was found to be non-mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay and was negative for inducing micronuclei in the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. The maximum tolerated dose in male and female Wistar rats was 2250 mg/kg bw/day. A 90-day repeat dose study was conducted in male and female Wistar rats according to OECD Guideline 408 and included a 21-day recovery period. The doses used in the study were 0, 25, 90 and 324 mg/kg bw per day in the main study, and in the recovery phase a control and 324 mg/kg bw/day group were included. One mortality was reported during the study, a high dose female, and test substance-related adverse clinical signs were reported in the high dose group. Other test substance-related changes noted in the high dose group included changes in body weights, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values, and in absolute and relative organ weights. Based on the results of the study, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for VOHO Hemp Oil was determined to be 90 mg/kg bw/day in both male and female Wistar rats."
https://openalex.org/W4205933894,"Abstract Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) possesses poor prognosis mainly due to lack of effective endocrine or targeted therapies, aggressive nature and high rate of chemoresistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to play critical roles in cancer recurrence and chemoresistance. THEMIS2 was identified as the sole common elevated gene in three triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and two ovarian CSC lines. We discovered an intrinsic signaling scaffold function of THEMIS2, which acts as a novel regulator of cancer stemness in promoting multiple cancer stemness properties including sphere formation, stemness markers expression, chemoresistance and tumorigenicity with low numbers of cancer cells implantation. For the first time, we demonstrated that THEMIS2 specifically enhanced MET activating phosphorylation by suppressing the association of protein-tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with p-MET and MET, which accounted mainly for THEMIS2-mediated effect on cancer stemness and chemoresistance. Increased THEMIS2 expression was associated with poor survival in TNBC patients and in patients from our breast cancer cohort. We found that non-cytotoxic dosages of cryptotanshinone (CPT) could potently inhibit cancer stemness, chemoresistance and tumorigenicity by suppressing expression of THEMIS2. Notably, stable overexpression of THEMIS2 is associated with enhanced sensitivity toward Capmatinib and CPT treatment. Expression levels of THEMIS2 and p-MET protein were positively correlated in the 465 breast cancer specimens. Our study revealed the novel oncogenic role of THEMIS2 and its underlying mechanism via suppressing PTP1B association with MET and thus leading to its activation. Our findings suggest that THEMIS2 could be a biomarker for MET targeted therapy and also provide a potential clinical application using low dosages of CPT for treatment of THEMIS2 positive TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W4206485019,"Ankle fractures have continued to occur through the COVID pandemic and, regardless of patient COVID status, often need operative intervention for optimizing long-term outcomes. For healthcare optimization, patient counseling, and care planning, understanding if COVID-positive patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery are at increased risk for perioperative adverse outcomes is of interest.The COVID-19 Research Database contains recent United States aggregated insurance claims. Patients who underwent ankle fracture surgery from April 1st, 2020 to June 15th, 2020 were identified. COVID status was identified by ICD coding. Demographics, comorbidities, and postoperative complications were extracted based on administrative data. COVID-positive versus negative patients were compared with univariate analyses. Propensity-score matching was done on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Multivariate regression was then performed to identify risk factors independently associated with the occurrence of 30-day postoperative adverse events.In total, 9,835 patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery were identified, of which 57 (0.58%) were COVID-positive. COVID-positive ankle fracture patients demonstrated a higher prevalence of comorbidities, including: chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity (p<0.05 for each). After propensity matching and controlling for all preoperative variables, multivariate analysis found that COVID-positive patients were at increased risk of any adverse event (odds ratio [OR] = 3.89, p = 0.002), a serious adverse event (OR = 5.48, p = 0.002), and a minor adverse event (OR = 3.10, p = 0.021).COVID-positive patients will continue to present with ankle fractures requiring operative intervention. Even after propensity matching and controlling for patient factors, COVID-positive patients were found to be at increased risk of 30-day perioperative adverse events. Not only do treatment teams need to be protected from the transmission of COVID in such situations, but the increased incidence of perioperative adverse events needs to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4206936783,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain various types of molecules including micro-RNAs, so isolating EVs can be an effective way to analyze and diagnose diseases. A lot of micro-RNAs have been known in relation to prostate cancer (PCa), and we evaluate miR-21, miR-141, and miR-221 in EVs and compare them with prostate-specific antigen (PSA). EVs were isolated from plasma of 38 patients with prostate cancer and 8 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), using a method that showed the highest recovery of RNA. Isolation of EVs concentrated micro-RNAs, reducing the cycle threshold (Ct) value of RT-qPCR amplification of micro-RNA such as miR-16 by 5.12 and miR-191 by 4.65, compared to the values before EV isolation. Normalization of target micro-RNAs was done using miR-191. For miR-221, the mean expression level of patients with localized PCa was significantly higher than that of the control group, having 33.45 times higher expression than the control group (p < 0.01). Area under curve (AUC) between BPH and PCa for miR-221 was 0.98 (p < 0.0001), which was better than AUC for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in serum for the same patients. The levels of miR-21 and miR-141 in EVs did not show significant changes in patients with PCa compared to the control group in this study. This study suggests isolating EVs can be a helpful approach in analyzing micro-RNAs with regard to disease."
https://openalex.org/W4226428988,"GABA is a major neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) synthesizes GABA from glutamate, and two isoforms of GAD, GAD65, and GAD67, are separately encoded by the Gad2 and Gad1 genes, respectively. The phenotypes differ in severity between GAD single isoform-deficient mice and rats. For example, GAD67 deficiency causes cleft palate and/or omphalocele in mice but not in rats. In this study, to further investigate the functional roles of GAD65 and/or GAD67 and to determine the contribution of these isoforms to GABA synthesis during development, we generated various kinds of GAD isoform(s)-deficient rats and characterized their phenotypes. The age of death was different among Gad mutant rat genotypes. In particular, all Gad1-/- ; Gad2-/- rats died at postnatal day 0 and showed little alveolar space in their lungs, suggesting that the cause of their death was respiratory failure. All Gad1-/- ; Gad2-/- rats and 18% of Gad1-/- ; Gad2+/- rats showed cleft palate. In contrast, none of the Gad mutant rats including Gad1-/- ; Gad2-/- rats, showed omphalocele. These results suggest that both rat GAD65 and GAD67 are involved in palate formation, while neither isoform is critical for abdominal wall formation. The GABA content in Gad1-/- ; Gad2-/- rat forebrains and retinas at embryonic day 20 was extremely low, indicating that almost all GABA was synthesized from glutamate by GADs in the perinatal period. The present study shows that Gad mutant rats are a good model for further defining the role of GABA during development."
https://openalex.org/W4200259782,"WHIM syndrome is a rare immunodeficiency disorder that is characterized by warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis. While several gain-of-function mutations that lead to C-terminal truncations, frame shifts and point mutations in the chemokine receptor CXCR4 have been identified in WHIM syndrome patients, the functional effect of these mutations are not fully understood. Here, we report on a new WHIM syndrome mutation that results in a frame shift within the codon for Ser339 (S339fs5) and compare the properties of S339fs5 with wild-type CXCR4 and a previously identified WHIM syndrome mutant, R334X. The S339fs5 and R334X mutants exhibited significantly increased signaling compared to wild-type CXCR4 including agonist-promoted calcium flux and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase activation. This increase is at least partially due to a significant decrease in agonist-promoted phosphorylation, β-arrestin binding, and endocytosis of S339fs5 and R334X compared with wild-type CXCR4. Interestingly, there were also significant differences in receptor degradation, with S339fs5 having a very high basal level of degradation compared with that of R334X and wild-type CXCR4. In contrast to wild-type CXCR4, both R334X and S339fs5 were largely insensitive to CXCL12-promoted degradation. Moreover, while basal and agonist-promoted degradation of wild-type CXCR4 was effectively inhibited by the CXCR4 antagonist TE-14016, this had no effect on the degradation of the WHIM mutants. Taken together, these studies identify a new WHIM syndrome mutant, CXCR4-S339fs5, which promotes enhanced signaling, reduced phosphorylation, β-arrestin binding and endocytosis, and a very high basal rate of degradation that is not protected by antagonist treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4200475073,"Enzalutamide, a second-generation antiandrogen, is commonly prescribed for the therapy of advanced prostate cancer, but enzalutamide-resistant, lethal, or incurable disease invariably develops. To understand the molecular mechanism(s) behind enzalutamide resistance, here, we comprehensively analyzed a range of prostate tumors and clinically relevant models by gene expression array, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot, which revealed that enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and tumors overexpress the pseudokinase, Tribbles 2 (TRIB2). Inhibition of TRIB2 decreases the viability of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells, suggesting a critical role of TRIB2 in these cells. Moreover, the overexpression of TRIB2 confers resistance in prostate cancer cells to clinically relevant doses of enzalutamide, and this resistance is lost upon inhibition of TRIB2. Interestingly, we found that TRIB2 downregulates the luminal markers androgen receptor and cytokeratin 8 in prostate cancer cells but upregulates the neuronal transcription factor BRN2 (Brain-2) and the stemness factor SOX2 (SRY-box 2) to induce neuroendocrine characteristics. Finally, we show that inhibition of either TRIB2 or its downstream targets, BRN2 or SOX2, resensitizes resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide. Thus, TRIB2 emerges as a potential new regulator of transdifferentiation that confers enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells via a mechanism involving increased cellular plasticity and lineage switching."
https://openalex.org/W4205586672,"Integration between information systems is critical, especially in the healthcare domain, since interoperability requirements are related to patients' data confidentiality, safety, and satisfaction. The goal of this study is to propose a solution based on the integration between queue management solution (QMS) and the electronic medical records (EMR), using Health Level Seven (HL7) protocols and Extensible Markup Language (XML). The proposed solution facilitates the patient's self-check-in within a healthcare organization in UAE. The solution aims to help in minimizing the waiting times within the outpatient department through early identification of patients who hold the Emirates national ID cards, i.e., whether an Emirati or expatriates. The integration components, solution design, and the custom-designed XML and HL7 messages were clarified in this paper. In addition, the study includes a simulation experiment through control and intervention weeks with 517 valid appointments. The experiment goal was to evaluate the patient's total journey and each related clinical stage by comparing the ""routine-based identification"" with the ""patient's self-check-in"" processes in case of booked appointments. As a key finding, the proposed solution is efficient and could reduce the ""patient's journey time"" by more than 14 minutes and ""time to identify"" patients by 10 minutes. There was also a significant drop in the waiting time to triage and the time to finish the triage process. In conclusion, the proposed solution is considered innovative and can provide a positive added value for the patient's whole journey."
https://openalex.org/W4205790448,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with a 5% 5-year survival rate for metastatic disease, yet with limited therapeutic advancements due to insufficient understanding of and inability to accurately capture high-risk CRC patients who are most likely to recur. We aimed to improve high-risk classification by identifying biological pathways associated with outcome in adjuvant stage II/III CRC.We included 1062 patients with stage III or high-risk stage II colon carcinoma from the prospective three-arm randomized phase 3 AVANT trial, and performed expression profiling to identify a prognostic signature. Data from validation cohort GSE39582, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and cell lines were used to further validate the prognostic biology. Our retrospective analysis of the adjuvant AVANT trial uncovered a prognostic signature capturing three biological functions-stromal, proliferative and immune-that outperformed the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) and recurrence prediction signatures like Oncotype Dx in an independent cohort. Importantly, within the immune component, high granzyme B (GZMB) expression had a significant prognostic impact while other individual T-effector genes were less or not prognostic. In addition, we found GZMB to be endogenously expressed in CMS2 tumor cells and to be prognostic in a T cell independent fashion. A limitation of our study is that these results, although robust and derived from a large dataset, still need to be clinically validated in a prospective study.This work furthers our understanding of the underlying biology that propagates stage II/III CRC disease progression and provides scientific rationale for future high-risk stratification and targeted treatment evaluation in biomarker defined subpopulations of resectable high-risk CRC. Our results also shed light on an alternative GZMB source with context-specific implications on the disease's unique biology."

This study aims to verify the role and the underlying mechanisms of CD147 in paclitaxel resistance. Immunostaining was used to analyze human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer tissues. RNA-sequencing was used to identify downstream effectors. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to detect apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were performed to determine protein interactions. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed to measure the speed of microtubule turnover. Xenograft tumor model was established to evaluate sensitivity of cancer cells to paclitaxel in vivo. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that silencing CD147 sensitized the cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment. CD147 protected cancer cells from paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 mediated apoptosis regardless of p53 status. Truncation analysis showed that the intracellular domain of CD147 (CD147ICD) was indispensable for CD147-regulated sensitivity to paclitaxel. Via screening the interacting proteins of CD147ICD, Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1) was identified to interact with CD147ICD via its C-terminal tail. Furthermore, we showed that RanBP1 mediated CD147-regulated microtubule stability and dynamics as well as response to paclitaxel treatment. These results demonstrated that CD147 regulated paclitaxel response by interacting with the C-terminal tail of RanBP1 and targeting CD147 may be a promising strategy for preventing paclitaxel resistant."
https://openalex.org/W4200099438,"2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) are well known as skin sensitizers that can cause dermatitis. DNFB has shown to more potently sensitize skin; however, how DNFB and DNCB cause skin inflammation at a molecular level and why this difference in their sensitization ability is observed remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify the molecular targets and mechanisms on which DNFB and DNCB act. We used a fluorescent calcium imaging plate reader in an initial screening assay before patch-clamp recordings for validation. Molecular docking in combination with site-directed mutagenesis was then carried out to investigate DNFB and DNCB binding sites in the TRPA1 ion channel that may be selectively activated by these tow sensitizers. We found that DNFB and DNCB selectively activated TRPA1 channel with EC50 values of 2.3 ± 0.7 μM and 42.4 ± 20.9 μM, respectively. Single-channel recordings revealed that DNFB and DNCB increase the probability of channel opening and act on three residues (C621, E625, and Y658) critical for TRPA1 activation. Our findings may not only help explain the molecular mechanism underlying the dermatitis and pruritus caused by chemicals such as DNFB and DNCB, but also provide a molecular tool 7.5-fold more potent than the current TRPA1 activator allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) used for investigating TRPA1 channel pharmacology and pathology."

Exposure to workplace violence is especially high for those women who work within the agriculture, the hotels, restaurants and catering, the transport as well as the manufacturing sectors. In this context, we explored workplace violence against women working as waitresses in various hotels, restaurants, cafeterias and grocery stores of Wolaita Sodo town, southern Ethiopia. Cross-sectional study was undertaken with descriptive and exploratory study designs. Qualitative data were collected by using in-depth interview method in which 16 waitresses were interviewed. Data were voice recorded, transcribed, and analyzed searching themes and patterns in the data. While we found that waitresses are highly exposed to workplace violence, the level of exposure to the violence varies across various circumstances, including working in large and small towns, the situation of the owners/supervisors, public's insight of the position, waitresses' ability to speak the local language, the role of the waitresses, customers' behavior and the specific context in which waitresses work. Waitresses were generally exposed to all forms of violence including spitting, throwing objects, simple physical assault, touching on private parts, and intimidation, among which verbal abuse and emotional exploitations are found to be the most common. Furthermore, the results revealed that though waitresses rarely experienced violence from female customers, the most common perpetrators involved in the practice were males. Amid widespread exposure of waitresses to all forms of workplace violence, ignorance, mostly motivated by fear of losing one's job, has been the common way waitresses respond to the violence. The study implies the vulnerability state of waitresses partly due to lack of adequate awareness regarding the rights and obligations expected of an employee when working in such organizations. This is again exacerbated by the lack of formal employment procedures in such organizations. Therefore, awareness creation and supervisory activities are expected from the media, workers' and social security office of the government, police and other concerned bodies."
https://openalex.org/W4207075316,"Mild anemia is a frequent although often overlooked finding in old age. Nevertheless, in recent years anemia has been linked to several adverse outcomes in the elderly population. Objective of the study was to investigate the association of mild anemia (hemoglobin concentrations: 10.0-11.9/12.9 g/dL in women/men) with all-cause mortality over 11-15 years and the effect of change in anemia status on mortality in young-old (65-84 years) and old-old (80+ years).The Health and Anemia and Monzino 80-plus are two door-to-door, prospective population-based studies that included residents aged 65-plus years in Biella municipality and 80-plus years in Varese province, Italy. No exclusion criteria were used.Among 4,494 young-old and 1,842 old-old, mortality risk over 15/11 years was significantly higher in individuals with mild anemia compared with those without (young-old: fully-adjusted HR: 1.35, 95%CI, 1.15-1.58; old-old: fully-adjusted HR: 1.28, 95%CI, 1.14-1.44). Results were similar in the disease-free subpopulation (age, sex, education, smoking history, and alcohol consumption adjusted HR: 1.54, 95%CI, 1.02-2.34). Both age groups showed a dose-response relationship between anemia severity and mortality (P for trend <0.0001). Mortality risk was significantly associated with chronic disease and chronic kidney disease mild anemia in both age groups, and with vitamin B12/folate deficiency and unexplained mild anemia in young-old. In participants with two hemoglobin determinations, seven-year mortality risk was significantly higher in incident and persistent anemic cases compared to constant non-anemic individuals in both age groups. In participants without anemia at baseline also hemoglobin decline was significantly associated with an increased mortality risk over seven years in both young-old and old-old. Limited to the Monzino 80-plus study, the association remained significant also when the risk was further adjusted also for time-varying covariates and time-varying anemia status over time.Findings from these two large prospective population-based studies consistently suggest an independent, long-term impact of mild anemia on survival at older ages."
https://openalex.org/W4225590518,"Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism to regulate organogenesis and fertility. Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) is one of the core components of the PRP19 complex, a multiple function complex including splicing, and it is involved in the initiation of meiosis through regulating AS in male mice. However, the role of BCAS2 in mouse oogenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that BCAS2 was highly expressed in the oocytes of primordial follicles. Vasa-Cre-mediated deletion of Bcas2 caused poor oocyte quality, abnormal oogenesis and follicular development. The deletion of Bcas2 in mouse oocytes caused alteration in 991 AS events that corresponded to 706 genes, including Pabpc1l, Nobox, Zfp207, Mybl2, Prc1, and Spc25, which were associated with oogenesis and spindle assembly. Moreover, the disruption of BCAS2 led to degradation of PRP19 core proteins in mouse oocytes. These results suggested that BCAS2 was involved in the AS of functional genes through PRP19 complex during mouse oocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W4200174245,"It is well established that the antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are selectively degraded by bacterial proteases in response to stress. However, how distinct stressors result in the selective degradation of specific antitoxins remain unanswered. MqsRA is a TA system activated by various stresses, including oxidation. Here, we reconstituted the Escherichia coli ClpXP proteolytic machinery in vitro to monitor degradation of MqsRA TA components. We show that the MqsA antitoxin is a ClpXP proteolysis substrate, and that its degradation is regulated by both zinc occupancy in MqsA and MqsR toxin binding. Using NMR chemical shift perturbation mapping, we show that MqsA is targeted directly to ClpXP via the ClpX substrate targeting N-domain, and ClpX mutations that disrupt N-domain binding inhibit ClpXP-mediated degradation in vitro. Finally, we discovered that MqsA contains a cryptic N-domain recognition sequence that is accessible only in the absence of zinc and MqsR toxin, both of which stabilize the MqsA fold. This recognition sequence is transplantable and sufficient to target a fusion protein for degradation in vitro and in vivo. Based on these results, we propose a model in which stress selectively targets nascent and zinc-free MqsA, resulting in exposure of the ClpX recognition motif for ClpXP-mediated degradation."
https://openalex.org/W4200279967,"Therapeutic antibody development requires discovery of an antibody molecule with desired specificities and drug-like properties. For toxicological studies, a therapeutic antibody must bind the ortholog antigen with a similar affinity to the human target to enable relevant dosing regimens, and antibodies falling short of this affinity design goal may not progress as therapeutic leads. Herein, we report the novel use of mammalian recombination signal sequence (RSS)-directed recombination for complementarity-determining region-targeted protein engineering combined with mammalian display to close the species affinity gap of human interleukin (IL)-13 antibody 731. This fully human antibody has not progressed as a therapeutic in part because of a 400-fold species affinity gap. Using this nonhypothesis-driven affinity maturation method, we generated multiple antibody variants with improved IL-13 affinity, including the highest affinity antibody reported to date (34 fM). Resolution of a cocrystal structure of the optimized antibody with the cynomolgus monkey (or nonhuman primate) IL-13 protein revealed that the RSS-derived mutations introduced multiple successive amino-acid substitutions resulting in a de novo formation of a π-π stacking-based protein-protein interaction between the affinity-matured antibody heavy chain and helix C on IL-13, as well as an introduction of an interface-distant residue, which enhanced the light chain-binding affinity to target. These mutations synergized binding of heavy and light chains to the target protein, resulting in a remarkably tight interaction, and providing a proof of concept for a new method of protein engineering, based on synergizing a mammalian display platform with novel RSS-mediated library generation."
https://openalex.org/W4200519095,"The malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for over 200 million infections and 400,000 deaths per year. At multiple stages during its complex life cycle, P. falciparum expresses several essential proteins tethered to its surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are critical for biological processes such as parasite egress and reinvasion of host red blood cells. Targeting this pathway therapeutically has the potential to broadly impact parasite development across several life stages. Here, we characterize an upstream component of parasite GPI anchor biosynthesis, the putative phosphomannomutase (PMM) (EC 5.4.2.8), HAD5 (PF3D7_1017400). We confirmed the PMM and phosphoglucomutase activities of purified recombinant HAD5 by developing novel linked enzyme biochemical assays. By regulating the expression of HAD5 in transgenic parasites with a TetR-DOZI-inducible knockdown system, we demonstrated that HAD5 is required for malaria parasite egress and erythrocyte reinvasion, and we assessed the role of HAD5 in GPI anchor synthesis by autoradiography of radiolabeled glucosamine and thin layer chromatography. Finally, we determined the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of HAD5 and identified a substrate analog that specifically inhibits HAD5 compared to orthologous human PMMs in a time-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway is exceptionally sensitive to inhibition in parasites and that HAD5 has potential as a specific, multistage antimalarial target."

Adjusted logistic mixed effects models with a random effect for school examined the association between weight status and whether a student was in the Healthy Fitness Zone (HFZ; met sex- and age-specific criterion-referenced standards) for the trunk extension and sit-and-reach. Compared to students with normal weight, the odds of being in the HFZ for trunk extension were lower for students with underweight (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.741, 0.795) and higher for students with overweight (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.081, 1.122) and obesity (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.090, 1.13). The odds of being in the HFZ for sit-and-reach were lower for students with underweight OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.826, 0.878), overweight (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.819, 0.844) and obesity (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.641, 0.661). Students with overweight and obesity perform better on the trunk extension, yet worse on the sit-and-reach, compared to students with normal weight. Teachers, administrators, and researchers should be aware of the relationship of BMI with student performance in these assessments."
https://openalex.org/W4205695368,"International stakeholder participation is important in the development of core outcome sets (COS). Stakeholders from varying regions may value health outcomes differently. Here, we explore how region, health income and participant characteristics influence prioritisation of outcomes during development of a COS for gastric cancer surgery trials (the GASTROS study).952 participants from 55 countries participating in a Delphi survey during COS development were eligible for inclusion. Recruits were grouped according to region (East or West), country income classification (high and low-to-middle income) and other characteristics (e.g. patients; age, sex, time since surgery, mode of treatment, surgical approach and healthcare professionals; clinical experience). Groups were compared with respect to how they categorised 56 outcomes identified as potentially important to include in the final COS ('consensus in', 'consensus out', 'no consensus'). Outcomes categorised as 'consensus in' or 'consensus out' by all 3 stakeholder groups would be automatically included in or excluded from the COS respectively.In total, 13 outcomes were categorised 'consensus in' (disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, surgery-related death, recurrence of cancer, completeness of tumour removal, overall quality of life, nutritional effects, all-cause complications, intraoperative complications, anaesthetic complications, anastomotic complications, multiple organ failure, and bleeding), 13 'consensus out' and 31 'no consensus'. There was little variation in prioritisation of outcomes by stakeholders from Eastern or Western countries and high or low-to-middle income countries. There was little variation in outcome prioritisation within either health professional or patient groups.Our study suggests that there is little variation in opinion within stakeholder groups when participant region and other characteristics are considered. This finding may help COS developers when designing their Delphi surveys and recruitment strategies. Further work across other clinical fields is needed before broad recommendations can be made."
https://openalex.org/W4206372154,"Toe muscular strength plays an important role in enhancing athletic performance because the forefoot is the only part of the body touching the ground. In general, muscular strength increases with age throughout adolescence, and sex-related difference in muscular strength becomes evident during childhood and adolescence. However, toe muscular strength is known to be levelled off after late adolescence in both sexes. For adolescent populations, therefore, the association of toe muscular strength with physical performance might differ with age and/or sex. This study aimed to investigate differences in relationships between toe muscular strength and vertical jump performance across sex and age in adolescent populations. The maximum isometric strength of the toe muscles and vertical jump height (VJ) were assessed in 479 junior high school students (JH) aged 12-14 years (243 boys and 236 girls) and 465 high school students (HS) aged 15-18 years (265 boys and 200 girls). Two types of measurements were performed to evaluate the toe muscular strength: toe gripping strength (TGS) with the metatarsophalangeal joint in the plantar flexed position and toe push strength (TPS) with the metatarsophalangeal joint in the dorsiflexed position. TGS and TPS were normalized to body weight. Two-way ANOVA showed that TGS had significant main effects of sex (boys > girls) and age (HS > JH) while TPS only had a significant main effect of sex (boys > girls). When the effects of sex and age were separately analyzed, VJ was significantly correlated with TGS in JH girls, HS girls, and JH boys (r = 0.253-0.269, p < 0.05), but not in HS boys (r = 0.062, p = 0.3351). These results suggest that toe muscular strength is relatively weakly associated with vertical jump performance in adolescent boys and girls, but the association would not be established in high school boys."
https://openalex.org/W4206765857,"Various phenolic compounds have been screened against Ganoderma boninense, the fungal pathogen causing basal stem rot in oil palms. In this study, we focused on the effects of salicylic acid (SA) on the growth of three G. boninense isolates with different levels of aggressiveness. In addition, study on untargeted metabolite profiling was conducted to investigate the metabolomic responses of G. boninense towards salicylic acid. The inhibitory effects of salicylic acid were both concentration- (P < 0.001) and isolate-dependent (P < 0.001). Also, growth-promoting effect was observed in one of the isolates at low concentrations of salicylic acid where it could have been utilized by G. boninense as a source of carbon and energy. Besides, adaptation towards salicylic acid treatment was evident in this study for all isolates, particularly at high concentrations. In other words, inhibitory effect of salicylic acid treatment on the fungal growth declined over time. In terms of metabolomics response to salicylic acid treatment, G. boninense produced several metabolites such as coumarin and azatyrosine, which suggests that salicylic acid modulates the developmental switch in G. boninense towards the defense mode for its survival. Furthermore, the liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) analysis showed that the growth of G. boninense on potato dextrose agar involved at least four metabolic pathways: amino acid metabolism, lipid pathway, tryptophan pathway and phenylalanine pathway. Overall, there were 17 metabolites that contributed to treatment separation, each with P<0.005. The release of several antimicrobial metabolites such as eudistomin I may enhance G. boninense's competitiveness against other microorganisms during colonisation. Our findings demonstrated the metabolic versatility of G. boninense towards changes in carbon sources and stress factors. G. boninense was shown to be capable of responding to salicylic acid treatment by switching its developmental stage."

https://openalex.org/W4225614992,"Myofibroblasts, or activated fibroblasts, play a critical role in the process of renal fibrosis. Targeting myofibroblasts to inhibit their activation or induce specific cell death has been considered to be an effective strategy to attenuate renal fibrosis. However, specific biomarkers for myofibroblasts are needed to ensure the efficacy of these strategies. Here, we verified that CD248 was mainly expressed in myofibroblasts in patients with chronic kidney disease, which was inversely correlated with renal function. The same result was also confirmed in renal fibrotic mice induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction and aristolochic acid nephropathy. By using an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) named IgG78-DM1, in which maytansinoid (DM1) was linked to a fully human antibody IgG78 through an uncleavable SMCC linker, we demonstrated that it could effectively bind with and kill CD248+ fibroblasts in vitro and alleviate renal fibrosis in mice models. Besides, we confirmed that IgG78-DM1 had qualified biosafety in vivo. Our results confirmed that CD248 can be used as a specific marker for myofibroblasts, and specific killing of CD248+ myofibroblasts by IgG78-DM1 has excellent anti-fibrotic effect in renal fibrotic mice. Our study expanded the application of ADC and provided a novel strategy for the treatment of renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4226061987,"Maternal surgical site infection after cesarean delivery is a clinical problem which contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. In Ethiopia admissions following cesarean section due to surgical site infection have been routine activities of health care institutions but there is limited scientific evidence on both the magnitude of the problem and factors associated with it making prevention mechanisms less effective. Therefore, this study aimed to assess magnitude and risk factors of post-cesarean section surgical site infection at primary hospitals of East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia.Institution-based cross sectional study with retrospective chart review was conducted from September 10-30 /2020 at 3 randomly selected primary hospitals of east Gojjam zone. The data were entered in Epi data version 3.1 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Science Software version 26. Post-cesarean section surgical site infection was measured based on disease classification and definition of the term by Center for Disease Control and Prevention. After checking for presence of multicollinarity, presence and degree of association of factors with outcome variable were computed through logistic regression analysis. Factors with P value ≤ 0.2 in bi-variable logistic regression analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis and those variables with P-value of <0.05 in multivariable analysis were considered statistically significant.From 622 medical records of women who underwent cesarean section, 77 (12.4%) of them developed surgical site infection. Rural residence [(AOR = 2.30, 95%CI: (1.29, 4.09)], duration of labor greater than 24hrs [(AOR = 3.48, 95%CI: (1.49, 8.09)], rupture of membrane>12hrs[(AOR = 4.61,95%CI:(2.34,9.09)], hypertension[(AOR = 3.14,95%CI:(1.29,7.59)] and preoperative Hematocrit ≤30%[(AOR = 3.22,95%CI:(1.25,8.31)] were factors significantly associated with post-cesarean section surgical site infections.Magnitude of post-cesarean section surgical site infection was a significant problem in primary hospitals. Minimizing prolonged labor; minimize early rupture of membrane, properly managing patients with comorbidities like hypertension, strengthen prophylaxis and treatment for anemia during antenatal care and raising awareness for rural residents can reduce the problem. Zonal police makers should give emphasis to reduce its burden."
https://openalex.org/W4226085575,"The first exposure to high-risk sexual and drug use behaviors often occurs during the period of youth (15-24 years old). These behaviors increase the risk of HIV infection, especially among young key populations (KP)-men how have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSW), and people who inject drugs (PWID). We describe the characteristics of young KP participants in the first Biobehavioral Surveillance (BBS) surveys conducted in Mozambique and examine their risk behaviors compared to adult KP.Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) methodology was used to recruit KP in three major urban areas in Mozambique. RDS-weighted pooled estimates were calculated to estimate the proportion of young KP residing in each survey city. Unweighted pooled estimates of risk behaviors were calculated for each key population group and chi-square analysis assessed differences in proportions between youth (aged less than 24 years old) and older adult KP for each population group.The majority of MSM and FSW participants were young 80.7% (95% CI: 71.5-89.9%) and 71.9% (95% CI: 71.9-79.5%), respectively, although not among PWID (18.2%, 95% CI: 13.2-23.2%). Young KP were single or never married, had a secondary education level or higher, and low employment rates. They reported lower perception of HIV risk (MSM: 72.3% vs 56.7%, p<0.001, FSW: 45.3% vs 24.4%, p<0.001), lower HIV testing uptake (MSM: 67.5% vs 72.3%, p<0.001; FSW: 63.2% vs 80.6%; p<0.001, PWID: 53.3% vs 31.2%; p = 0.001), greater underage sexual debut (MSM: 9.6% vs 4.8%, p<0.001; FSW: 35.2% vs 22.9%, p<0.001), and greater underage initiation of injection drug use (PWID: 31.9% vs 7.0%, p<0.001). Young KP also had lower HIV prevalence compared to older KP: MSM: 3.3% vs 27.0%, p<0.001; FSW: 17.2% vs 53.7%, p<0.001; and PWID: 6.0% vs 55.0%, p<0.001. There was no significant difference in condom use across the populations.There is an immediate need for a targeted HIV response for young KP in Mozambique so that they are not left behind. Youth must be engaged in the design and implementation of interventions to ensure that low risk behaviors are sustained as they get older to prevent HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W4205309734,"To assess the determinants of ED use in paediatric patients enrolled in an Integrated Paediatric Home Care (IPHC) program.A retrospective study was conducted using administrative databases on a cohort of patients enrolled in an IPHC program between January 1st, 2012, and December 31st, 2017, in Northern Italy. ED visits that occurred during the IPHC program were considered. Data were collected considering sociodemographic, clinical and organizational variables. A multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed. The dependent variable to identify possible associations was ED visit.A total of 463 ED visits occurred in 465 children, with an incidence rate of 1. The risk of ED visits significantly increased among children involved in the IPHC program after hospital discharge (OR 1.94). Additionally, the risk of ED visits increased significantly as the duration of IPHC increased (OR 5.80 between 101 and 200 days, to OR 7.84 between 201 and 300 days, OR 12.54 between 301 and 400 days and OR 18.67 to more than 400 days).The overall results represent a practical perspective to contribute improving both the service quality of IPHC and reducing low acuity and improper ED use."
https://openalex.org/W4206291074,"Child mortality has been linked to infectious diseases, malnutrition and lack of access to essential health services. We investigated possible predictors for death and patients lost to follow up (LTFU) for paediatric patients at the inpatient department (IPD) and inpatient therapeutic feeding centre (ITFC) of the Anka General Hospital (AGH), Zamfara State, Nigeria, to inform best practices at the hospital.We conducted a retrospective cohort review study using routinely collected data of all patient admissions to the IPD and ITFC with known hospital exit status between 2016 and 2018. Unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios (aRR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using Poisson regression to estimate the association between the exposure variables and mortality as well as LTFU.The mortality rate in IPD was 22% lower in 2018 compared to 2016 (aRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.66-0.93) and 70% lower for patients coming from lead-affected villages compared to patients from other villages (aRR 0.30; 95% CI 0.19-0.48). The mortality rate for ITFC patients was 41% higher during rainy season (aRR 1.41; 95% CI 1.2-1.6). LTFU rates in ITFC increased in 2017 and 2018 when compared to 2016 (aRR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.0 and aRR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.8) and patients in ITFC had 2.5 times higher LTFU rates when coming from a lead-affected village.Our data contributes clearer understanding of the situation in the paediatric wards in AGH in Nigeria, but identifying specific predictors for the multifaceted nature of mortality and LTFU is challenging. Mortality in paediatric patients in IPD of AGH improved during the study period, which is likely linked to better awareness of the hospital, but still remains high. Access to healthcare due to seasonal restrictions contributes to mortalities due to late presentation. Increased awareness of and easier access to healthcare, such as for patients living in lead-affected villages, which are still benefiting from an MSF lead poisoning intervention, decreases mortalities, but increases LTFU. We recommend targeted case audits and qualitative studies to better understand the role of health-seeking behaviour, and social and traditional factors in the use of formal healthcare in this part of Nigeria and potentially similar settings in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W4206768416,"Chromatin-modifying complexes containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities play critical roles in the regulation of gene transcription in eukaryotes. These complexes are thought to lack intrinsic DNA-binding activity, but according to a well-established paradigm, they are recruited via protein-protein interactions by gene-specific transcription factors and posttranslational histone modifications to their sites of action on the genome. The mammalian Sin3L/Rpd3L complex, comprising more than a dozen different polypeptides, is an ancient HDAC complex found in diverse eukaryotes. The subunits of this complex harbor conserved domains and motifs of unknown structure and function. Here, we show that Sds3, a constitutively-associated subunit critical for the proper functioning of the Sin3L/Rpd3L complex, harbors a type of Tudor domain that we designate the capped Tudor domain. Unlike canonical Tudor domains that bind modified histones, the Sds3 capped Tudor domain binds to nucleic acids that can form higher-order structures such as G-quadruplexes and shares similarities with the knotted Tudor domain of the Esa1 histone acetyltransferase that was previously shown to bind single-stranded RNA. Our findings expand the range of macromolecules capable of recruiting the Sin3L/Rpd3L complex and draw attention to potentially new biological roles for this HDAC complex."
https://openalex.org/W4206969864,"Obstetric intensive care unit admission (ICU) suggests severe morbidity. However, there is no available data on the subject in Ghana. This retrospective review was conducted to determine the indications for obstetric ICU admission, their outcomes and factors influencing these outcomes to aid continuous quality improvement in obstetric care.This was a retrospective review conducted in a tertiary hospital in Ghana. Data on participant characteristics including age and whether participant was intubated were collected from patient records for all obstetric ICU admissions from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2019. Descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies, proportions and charts. Hazard ratios were generated for relations between obstetric ICU admission outcome and participant characteristics. A p-value <0.05 was deemed statistically significant.There were 443 obstetric ICU admissions over the review period making up 25.7% of all ICU admissions. The commonest indications for obstetric ICU admissions were hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (70.4%, n = 312/443), hemorrhage (14.4%, n = 64/443) and sepsis (9.3%, n = 41/443). The case fatality rates for hypertension, hemorrhage, and sepsis were 17.6%, 37.5%, and 63.4% respectively. The obstetric ICU mortality rate was 26% (115/443) over the review period. Age ≥25 years and a need for mechanical ventilation carried increased mortality risks following ICU admission while surgery in the index pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk of death.Hypertension, haemorrhage and sepsis are the leading indications for obstetric ICU admissions. Thus, preeclampsia screening and prevention, as well as intensifying antenatal education on the danger signs of pregnancy can minimize obstetric complications. The establishment of an obstetric HDU in CCTH and the strengthening of communication between specialists and the healthcare providers in the lower facilities, are also essential for improved pregnancy outcomes. Further studies are needed to better appreciate the wider issues underlying obstetric ICU admission outcomes.This was a review of the reasons for admitting severely-ill pregnant women and women who had delivered within the past 42 days to the intensive care unit (ICU), the admission outcomes and risk factors associated with ICU mortality in a tertiary hospital in a low-resource country. High blood pressure and its complications, bleeding and severe infections were observed as the three most significant reasons for ICU admissions in decreasing order of significance. Pre-existing medical conditions and those arising as a result of, or aggravated by pregnancy; obstructed labour and post-operative monitoring were the other reasons for ICU admission over the study period. Overall, 26% of the admitted patients died at the ICU and maternal age of at least 25 years and the need for intubation were identified as risk factors for ICU deaths. Attention must be paid to high blood pressure during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4207016480,"The world of science is growing at an unprecedented speed with more and more scholarly papers produced each year. The scientific landscape is constantly changing as research specialties evolve, merge or become obsolete. It is difficult for researchers, research managers and the public alike to keep abreast with these changes and maintain a true and fair overview of the world of science. Such an overview is necessary to stimulate scientific progress, to maintain flexible and responsive research organizations, and to secure collaboration and knowledge exchange between different research specialties and the wider community. Although science mapping is applied to a wide range of scientific areas, examples of their practical use are sparse. This paper demonstrates how to use a topical, scientific reference maps to understand and navigate in dynamic research landscapes and how to utilize science maps to facilitate strategic thinking. In this study, the research domain of biology at Aarhus University serves as an example. All scientific papers authored by the current, permanent staff were extracted (6,830 in total). These papers were used to create a semantic cognitive map of the research field using a co-word analysis based on keywords and keyword phrases. A workflow was written in Python for easy and fast retrieval of information for topic maps (including tokens from keywords section and title) to generate intelligible research maps, and to visualize the distribution of topics (keywords), papers, journal categories, individual researchers and research groups on any scale. The resulting projections revealed new insights into the structure of the research community and made it possible to compare researchers or research groups to describe differences and similarities, to find scientific overlaps or gaps, and to understand how they relate and connect. Science mapping can be used for intended (top-down) as well as emergent (bottom-up) strategy development. The paper concludes that science maps provide alternative views of the intricate structures of science to supplement traditional bibliometric information. These insights may help strengthen strategic thinking and boost creativity and thus contribute to the progress of science."
https://openalex.org/W4206373237,"Critical thinking is a requisite skill for college success, employability, and conducive active civic participation. Empirical studies have noted to the low achievement of Arab students on critical thinking assessments. Insufficient endeavors have attempted to propose effective interventions enhancing critical thinking abilities among Arab students. The current analysis provides a preliminary overview of a special course designed to improve critical thinking skills among Arab college students. Results indicated a great improvement in all areas of critical thinking including explanation of information, identification of strategies, implementing solutions, and formulating logical inferences. Students' scores on a critical thinking assessment increased from sufficient to good as a result of participating in the program. The gains are consistent after controlling for gender, major, class seniority, and nationality. Notwithstanding these promising results, this paper is limited in several respects including the choice of critical thinking assessments represented by two questions, the highly contextualized setting making it difficult to be replicated, and the convenient sampling strategy used to recruit participants. This set of limitations, however, does not discourage proactive attempts like designing special courses to enhance students' critical thinking acquisition in the Middle East."
