https://openalex.org/W2004851826,"Early mental development is analyzed from an evolutionary viewpoint and related to the dynamic interplay of genetic programming, maturational status, and environmental influence. Data are reported from a large sample of twins and siblings who have been tested longitudinally from 3 months to 6 years of age. Monozygotic twins became increasingly concordant with age and also paralleled each other for the spurts and lags in development. Dizygotic twins became less concordant with age and eventually matched their singleton siblings as closely as one another. The overall results suggested that the course of mental development is guided by the intrinsic scheduling of the genetic program acting in concert with maturational status and environmental influence."
https://openalex.org/W2134431894,"Within minutes after its elevation from the egg surface, the sea urchin fertilization envelope (FE) becomes ""hardened"" by a reaction that renders it resistant to agents that solubilize, denature or degrade most proteins. Peroxidase activity is released into the surrounding seawater from Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus eggs during fertilization. Evidence from several sources indicate that the catalytic action of the peroxidase is responsible for hardening the FE through the phenolic coupling of tyrosyl residues of the FE proteins. First, the peroxidase is localized within the hardened FE and within the crystalline FE precursor material released from egg cortical granules during the fertilization reaction. Second, a direct correlation is established between the effectiveness of compounds in inhibiting the cortical granule peroxidase (CGP) and their effectiveness in inhibiting hardening of the FE. Third, the CGP catalyzes the cross-linking of tyrosines in solution, a reaction known to be catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Fourth, acid hydrolysates of hardened FEs contain cross-linked tyrosines that are identified by comparing their chromatographic ultraviolet absorption and fluorescent characteristics to those known for cross-linked tyrosines formed by HRP. Finally, when eggs are fertilized in the presence of 125I, the CGP heavily labels proteins of the FE and of the crystalline FE precursor material released with the enzyme from the cortical granules. The iodide label reflects the localization of the CGP and may reflect the sites of peroxidase-generated tyrosyl phenyl radicals involved in the tyrosine coupling reaction. Maximal iodide labeling occurs during the first 5 min period following fertilization, corresponding to the period of FE hardening."
https://openalex.org/W1996794195,"Abstract Rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells respond to Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) by ceasing to undergo mitosis and acquiring neuronal characteristics, including outgrowth of neurites and electrical excitability. We have found that NGF treatment results in no consistent qualitative and only a few minor quantitative changes in the two-dimensional electrophoresis pattern of 14 C-amino acid-labeled proteins synthesized by the cells. On the other hand, NGF stimulates the incorporation of radiolabeled fucose or glucosamine into several components, including one of apparent molecular weight 230,000 daltons on one- and two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This component is removed by mild trypsinization of intact cells and therefore appears to be a glycoprotein (named here NILE) at least partially exposed on the cell surface. Stimulation of NILE glycoprotein labeling can first be detected after 2 days of exposure to NGF and increases progressively with time of treatment. This change is not solely a consequence of the cessation of cell division caused by NGF, since it does not occur in nondividing PC12 populations prepared by cytosine arabinoside treatment. NGF stimulates labeling of NILE glycoprotein even when attachment and process outgrowth are prevented by growing the cells in spinner suspension cultures. The relative rate of labeling attained under these conditions is less, however, than in NGF-treated, substrate-attached cells. Stimulation of NILE glycoprotein labeling by NGF is selectively blocked (as is neurite outgrowth) by camptothecin, an RNA synthesis inhibitor, and thus may require transcription. Despite their similarities in apparent size and exposure on cell surfaces, the NILE and LETS glycoproteins are shown to be immunologically distinct."

https://openalex.org/W1537346126,"Microsomes prepared from embryonic chick bone contain a vitamin K-dependent carboxylating system which post-translationally converts glutamic acid residues in peptides to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gamma-CGlu). Glutamic acid residues in both endogenous chick bone microsomal protein and in the synthetic peptide Phe Leu-Glu-Glu-Val are gamma-carboxylated. These data suggest that bone cells have the capacity for de novo gamma-CGlu synthesis and may be responsible for synthesis of osteocalcin, the major gamma-CGlu protein in bone."
https://openalex.org/W1580985143,"Procollagen synthesized by freshly excised chick enbryo leg tendons is efficiently processed by proteolytic removal of first the amino propeptides and then the carboxyl propeptides. The same processes proceed in confluent short term cell cultures derived from such tendon explants; in sparse cultures cleavage of the amino propeptides predominates. Separate amino and carboxyl procollagen peptidase activities were demonstrated by specific assays in enzymes obtained from cell culture media by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and velocity sedimentation. Both enzymes are inhibited by EDTA and 1:10 phenanthroline but not by inhibitors of serine proteases. Evidence is provided that the proteolytic scissions are specific and similar to the physiologically occurring processes. The collagen telopeptides left after cutting by the enzymes can participate in lysyl oxidase-induced cross-linking. The enzymes can remove propeptides from cross-linked procollagens without destroying these links which occur through telopeptides. The enzymes act on the separated amino and carboxyl portions of procollagen fragmented by vertebrate collagenase and can act on procollagens which have been associated as well as on molecules in solution."

https://openalex.org/W2053675880,Hamsters exposed to short days undergo gonadal collapse followed by recrudescence and insensitivity to the regressive effects of such photoperiods. This refractoriness may be due to exhaustion of the pineal gland or desensitization of its target. Hamsters whose gonads had spontaneously recrudesced were injected with melatonin (25 micrograms per injection) once daily (known to induce regression in intact hamsters) or twice daily (reported to arrest reproduction in pinealectomized hamsters) for 7 weeks. In neither case did refractory hamsters respond to melatonin treatment. The gonads of intact hamsters treated with melatonin for 21 weeks regressed and spontaneously recrudesced along a normal time course. These results indicate that gonadal refractoriness is due to insensitivity of the target tissues of the pineal gland and imply that melantonin participates in photoperiodic regulation of reproduction in the golden hamster.
https://openalex.org/W2009517747,"This paper describes the relationship between cell size and cell division in two situations. In the first, quiescent cells were sorted on the basis of cell size using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and returned to culture. The results of this type of experiment are compatible with the idea that once cells have completed a size-dependent lag, the rate of entry of cells into S phase is controlled by a rate-limiting random event (or transition). The second kind of experiment follows the kinetics of complete cell cycles in rapidly proliferating cells whose mothers had been sorted on the basis of cell size. The cells born of small mother cells have longer cycle times than cells derived from large mothers. The difference in the cycle time of these two classes was due to differences in the B phase of the cell cycle [containing S, G2, M and part of G1 (G1B)], transition probability being the same in both size classes. Our results show that S, G2 and M are unaffected by size, thus confining the effect of size to G1B. It seems probable that the variability of B phase in cloned cell populations is partly due to variations of cell size at division, and correlations between the cycle times of sister cells result because sibling cells are more similar in size than unrelated cells. The major factor controlling cell division in mouse fibroblasts is shown, however, to be the transition probability; size has a more minor role."

https://openalex.org/W2159895855,"Pigment epithelial cells in culture retain their ability to phagocytize rod outer segments. These cells phagocytize rod outer segments isolated from light-adapted rats, or from dark-adapted rats killed after the time at which the lights would normally be turned on. However, they phagocytize for fewer rod outer segments prepared in the dark from the retinas of rats killed before the onset of the normal light cycle. Phagocytosis of dark rod outer segments is variable, but that of light outer segments is reproducible. It is postulated that the effect of light is to synchronize the chemical events that occur at the surface of the rods to prepare them for phagocytosis. These processes also occur in the dark, but more slowly and irregularly than in the light."

https://openalex.org/W2042012877,"The expression of interspersed repetitive sequences in the RNA of mature sea urchin oocytes was investigated. 3H-DNA tracers representing short interspersed repetitive sequences a few hundred nucleotides long, and long repetitive sequences approximately 2000 nucleotides long, were prepared from genomic DNA of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. These tracers were reacted with excess RNA from the mature oocyte. About 80% of the reactable short repeat tracer and 35% of the long repeat tracer hybridized. Thus most of the repetitive sequence families in the short repeat tracer are represented in oocyte RNA, and transcripts complementary to both strands of many repeat sequences are present. The kinetics of the reaction show that some transcripts are highly prevalent (greater than 10(5) copies per oocyte), while others are rare (approximately 10(3) copies per oocyte). Nine cloned repetitive sequences were labeled, strand-separated and reacted with the oocyte RNA. Transcripts of both strands of all nine repeats were found in the RNA. The prevalence of transcripts of the cloned repeat families varied from approximately 3000 to 100,000 copies per oocyte. Studies with both cloned and genomic tracers show that transcript prevalence is independent of the genomic reiteration frequency of the transcribed repetitive sequences. Most of the families represented by prevalent transcripts have fewer than 200 copies per haploid genome. The RNA molecules with which the cloned repeats react are at least 1000-2000 nucleotides in length. Other experiments show that a majority of the members of repeat families represented by prevalent transcripts in the oocyte RNA are interspersed among single-copy sequence elements in the genome."

https://openalex.org/W1986455159,"The hamster cell line NIL8 secretes the C3 component of complement as well as collagenous molecules and fibronectin (LETS protein). The C3 is found in the culture medium as a disulfidebonded complex of two polypeptides of 130,000 daltons (alpha) and 65,000 daltons (beta). The secreted C3 can be quantitatively cleaved to C3b and further cleaved by C3 inactivators. The activation of C3 to C3b is promoted by zymosan or by antibody-coated erythrocytes, demonstrating participation in both the classical and alternative complement pathways. The availability of this culture system has enabled us to show that C3 is synthesized as a 185,000 dalton precursor (proC3) which is biologically inactive and becomes cleaved to active C3. Some other established cell lines (NIL1 and BALB/c 3T3) also secrete C3, but some others do not."

https://openalex.org/W1537864948,"Incubation of chick embryo epiphyseal microsomal preparations with either UDP-[14C]GlcUA or UDP-[14C]-GalNAc plus exogenous chondroitin 6-sulfate resulted in the incorporation of either a single [14C]GlcUA or a [14C]GalNAc onto the nonreducing ends of the exogenous glycosaminoglycan. Degradation by chondroitinase ABC yielded the terminal products [14C]Di-OS, [14C]Di-6S, and [14C]GalNAc. Incubations of the microsomal preparations with either UDP-[14C]GlcUA or UDP-GalN[3H]Ac without exogenous chondroitin 6-sulfate resulted in the addition of a single sugar onto the nonreducing end of endogenous chondroitin sulfate. Degradation by chondroitinase ABC yielded the terminal products [14C]Di-OS, [14C]Di-6S, and GalN[3H]Ac in a molar ratio of approximately 1:1:3.5. Incubations of the microsomal preparations with both UDP-[14C]-GlcUA and UDP-GalN[3H]Ac together resulted in formation of [14C,3H]chondroitin chains added to the endogenous chondroitin sulfate. Degradation by chondroitinase ABC resulted in products with a molar ratio of [14C,3H]Di-OS to GalN[3H]Ac varying from approximately 1:1.5 to 1:3. The results of these experiments indicate that chondroitin 6-sulfate terminates at its nonreducing end in a mixture of GlcUA and GalNAc (some sulfated). GalNAc is somewhat more frequent as the terminal sugar and adds more readily to endogenous acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W193926564,"The subunit structure of the large external transformation-sensitive (LETS) protein of chick embryo fibroblasts has been examined. When cells were labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels in the absence of reducing agent, no more than 1% of the 1251labeled LETS protein migrated as monomer (M, = 230,000 to 240,000). About 20 to 23% of LETS migrated as dimer and the remainder failed to enter the 3.5% stacking gels (LETS high molecular weight (HMW) complex). These proportions did not appear to be an artifact resulting from disulfide bond formation induced by the lactoperoxidase labeling technique. Additional experiments rule out a second possible artifact, namely, that LETS HMW complex was actually LETS dimer that was retained at the top of the gel because of trapping: 1) the measured proportion of LETS dimer was unaffected by the concentration of the cell lysate sample; and 2) ‘251-labeled LETS dimer added exogenously to nonlabeled, nonreduced cell lysates migrated almost entirely as dimer with less than 6% trapped at the top of the gel in the presence of cell lysate concentrations routinely employed in our assays. Pulse-labeling experiments demonstrated the conversion of LETS dimer to HMW complex. The kinetics were biphasic, with rapid conversion ( TI,~ = 0.8 to 1.9 h) of most of the LETS dimer followed by slow conversion ( TI,Z = 14.5 h) of the remainder. The proportion of LETS present as dimer predicted from the kinetic parameters agreed well with the experimental value determined by lactoperoxidase labeling. LETS dimer and HMW complex were shed into the medium at similar slow rates, and culture conditions seemed to have little influence on the subunit structure of LETS. The proportions of LETS dimer and HMW complex were the same for culture times between 1 and 3 days and for 2day cultures at final cell densities ranging from 1 to 18 x lo4 cells/cm’."

https://openalex.org/W1528168357,"Abstract The effects of several denaturants and detergents on the structure and stability of cell surface protein have been evaluated by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. Cell surface protein undergoes a single broad transition in both urea and guanidinium chloride. Although guanidinium chloride is twice as effective as urea on a molar basis, both appear to eliminate all of the organized structure present in the native molecule. Nonionic surfactants and lysolecithin have little effect on cell surface protein. However, sodium dodecyl sulfate increases the alpha helical content and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide increases the beta structure of cell surface protein. The reorganization of the polypeptide backbone requires the loss of certain restraints imposed by tertiary interactions as evidenced by a decrease in ellipticity in the far ultraviolet and in the polarization of tryptophanyl fluorescence. These results along with the data of a previous paper (Alexander, S. S., Jr., Colonna, G., Yamada, K. M., Pastan, I., and Edelhoch, H. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5820--5824) suggest the presence of structural domains distributed along the flexible polypeptide chain of cell surface protein."

The major form of the active enxyme in plasma was purified to apparent homogeneity and is a 300,000-dalton tetramer containing 4 atoms of tightly bound copper. About 20% of the enzyme activity in plasma was isolated as a dimeric form of this enzyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the purified form gave a polypeptide subunit molecular weight of 72,000 and disulfide-linked dimers of this component were observed. Both forms of the enzyme are apparently glycoproteins and interact with immobilized concanavalin A. Furthermore, the enzyme is capable of binding to alkyl-substituted agarose by hydrophobic interaction. Advantage was taken of these properties to purify the enzyme. Both purified tetramer and partially purified dimer were further characterized by kinetic analysis and the Stokes radii and S20,W of these species were compared. Rabbit antiserum to the purified tetramer revealed no immunochemical differences between the two enzyme forms by using a method of immunotitration."
https://openalex.org/W2029261906,"Amiprophos methyl (APM) is a strong, readily reversible and highly selective inhibitor of tubulin synthesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardi. The extensive induction of tubulin synthesis that accompanies flagellar regeneration in this organism is prevented by 3 to 10 micrometerAPM. When applied after induction has begun, APM causes a rapid cessation of tubulin synthesis. Translation studies in vitro indicate that the lack of tubulin production in APM-treated cells is not due to a direct inhibition of tubulin messenger RNA translation but rather to a selective depletion of tubulin messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1565267775,"To examine the relationship between pre-protein cleavage and nascent chain glycosylation placental mRNA was translated in a reconstituted ascites cell-free system containing microsomal membranes prepared from tunicamycin-treated or untreated ascites tumor cells. In the absence of membranes, first trimester RNA directed the synthesis of the pre-form of the alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, whereas, in the presence of normal membranes, first trimester RNA directed the synthesis of a glycosylated form of the alpha subunit. Cell-free lysates containing membranes derived from tunicamycin-treated cells synthesized an alpha subunit protein with little, if any, carbohydrate. This protein was apparently sequestered into membranes since it was resistant to the action of trypsin which was added after translation. The pre-peptide of the alpha subunit protein was removed by treated membranes as determined by amino acid sequence analyses. The non-glycosylated protein pre-placental lactogen was also cleaved to its mature form by tunicamycin membranes. These data strongly suggest that, in vitro, glycosylation is not obligatory for pre-protein cleavage and sequestration of these placental protein hormones."

https://openalex.org/W154465914,"Theaction of pig pancreatic phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) on phosphatidylcholine bilayer is studied under a variety of substrate modification conditions including the incorporation of long chain alcohols (hexanol and several isomeric octanols) into the bilayer. The rate of hydrolysis shows a biphasic dependence upon the concentration of the activating alcohol. The hexanol to lipid molar ratio in the bilayer is approximately 1.4:1 at the optimal alkanol concentration. The lag phase at the beginning of hydrolysis has been shown to depend upon the nature of the bilayer as modified by different alkanols and by intrinsic differences in the unilamellar vesicles (approximate diameter approximately 250 A) compared to the multilamellar vesicles. The rate constant for the activation process responsible for the lag period is first order and does not depend upon the concentration of the enzyme, substrate, alkanol, and calcium. These and other experiments are interpreted in terms of a hypothesis that the pancreatic phospholipase interacts with the bilayer by a catalytic and a recognition site. The data suggest that the packing of the interface regulates the interaction of both the catalytic and the recognition site. It is postulated that the biphasic activation profile as a function of hexanol concentration may be a consequence of two-site interactions between the enzyme and the substrate interface."

The relative accessibility of rat liver ribosomal proteins to reductive alkylation was then examined. Intact ribosomes were firs labeled with [14C]formaldehyde and NaBH4. The proteins were then separated from RNA, denatured in 6 M guanidine, and labeled again using formaldehyde and NaB3H4. The relative accessibility of individual proteins to labeling in the intact state could thus be determined from their 3H/14C ratios following separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The results suggest that proteins S6, S11, S26, L3, and L35 are less accessible to labeling while proteins S1, S15, L11, L12, L16, and L24 appear relatively more accessible. The accessibility of individual proteins in ribosomes in different conformational states were then compared. The results indicated that S3, L7, and L36 are likely to be involved in a structural difference when normal polysomes and normal monomers are compared. Also, that S26 and L35, and probably S3, S20, L7, L8, L24, L27, L28 and L34 appear to be involved in a ribosomal conformation change induced by ethionine intoxication."

The stoichiometry of the production of 5-hydroxymethyluracil and CO2 was not changed by the substitution of ATP for ascorbate. The 7-hydroxylase was found to have considerable thermal stability, and inactivation at 98 degrees C resulted in a parallel loss of the activities effected by ascorbate and ATP.
