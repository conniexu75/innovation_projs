https://openalex.org/W1909310469,"Exendin-4 purified from Heloderma suspectum venom shows structural relationship to the important incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1-(7-36)-amide (GLP-1). We demonstrate that exendin-4 and truncated exendin-(9-39)-amide specifically interact with the GLP-1 receptor on insulinoma-derived cells and on lung membranes. Exendin-4 displaced 125I-GLP-1, and unlabeled GLP-1 displaced 125I-exendin-4 from the binding site at rat insulinoma-derived RINm5F cells. Exendin-4 had, like GLP-1, a pronounced effect on intracellular cAMP generation, which was reduced by exendin-(9-39)-amide. When combined, GLP-1 and exendin-4 showed additive action on cAMP. They each competed with the radio-labeled version of the other peptide in cross-linking experiments. The apparent molecular mass of the respective ligand-binding protein complex was 63,000 Da. Exendin-(9-39)-amide abolished the cross-linking of both peptides. Exendin-4, like GLP-1, stimulated dose dependently the glucose-induced insulin secretion in isolated rat islets, and, in mouse insulinoma beta TC-1 cells, both peptides stimulated the proinsulin gene expression at the level of transcription. Exendin-(9-39)-amide reduced these effects. In conclusion, exendin-4 is an agonist and exendin-(9-39)-amide is a specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1581093018,"To understand the role of the 75-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor in non-lymphoid cells, the cytotoxic signaling and binding activities of the 55-kDa (TNF-R1) and 75-kDa (TNF-R2) TNF receptors were investigated using agonist and antagonist antibodies specific for the two receptor types. This study indicates that although TNF-R2 can significantly reduce the TNF concentration required for cell killing, the mechanism by which this is accomplished is not through the generation of an intracellular signal by TNF-R2. Instead, TNF-R2 regulates the rate of TNF association with TNF-R1, possibly by increasing the local concentration of TNF at the cell surface through rapid association and dissociation. We propose that other cell-surface receptors, such as the low affinity p75 nerve growth factor receptor, may utilize an analogous ligand passing mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1728066272,"Previous in vitro studies have shown that isolated mitochondria can generate oxygen radicals. However, whether a similar phenomenon can also occur in intact organs is unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that resumption of mitochondrial respiration upon reperfusion might be a mechanism of oxygen radical formation in postischemic hearts, and that treatment with inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration might prevent this phenomenon. Three groups of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia at 37 degrees C, followed by reflow. Throughout ischemia and early reperfusion the hearts received, respectively: (a) 5 mM KCl (controls), (b) 5 mM sodium amobarbital (Amytal, which blocks mitochondrial respiration at Site I, at the level of NADH dehydrogenase), and (c) 5 mM potassium cyanide (to block mitochondrial respiration distally, at the level of cytochrome c oxidase). The hearts were then processed to directly evaluate oxygen radical generation by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, or to measure oxygen radical-induced membrane lipid peroxidation by malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) content of subcellular fractions. Severity of ischemia, as assessed by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of cardiac ATP, phosphocreatine, and pH, was similar in all groups. Oxygen-centered free radical concentration averaged 3.84 +/- 0.54 microM in reperfused control hearts, and it was significantly reduced by Amytal treatment (1.98 +/- 0.26; p"
https://openalex.org/W2016837051,"The function of voltage-gated sodium channels that are responsible for action potential generation in mammalian brain neurons is modulated by phosphorylation by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (cA-PK) and by protein kinase C (PKC). Reduction of peak sodium currents by cA-PK in intact cells required concurrent activation of PKC and was prevented by blocking phosphorylation of serine 1506, a site in the inactivation gate of the channel that is phosphorylated by PKC but not by cA-PK. Replacement of serine 1506 with negatively charged amino acids mimicked the effect of phosphorylation. Conversion of the consensus sequence surrounding serine 1506 to one more favorable for cA-PK enhanced modulation of sodium currents by cA-PK. Convergent modulation of sodium channels required phosphorylation of serine 1506 by PKC accompanied by phosphorylation of additional sites by cA-PK. This regulatory mechanism may serve to integrate neuronal signals mediated through these parallel signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1938197614,"The rate-limiting step of eukaryotic protein synthesis is the binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, a step which is catalyzed by initiation factors of the eIF-4 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4) group: eIF-4A, eIF-4B, eIF-4E, and eIF-4 gamma. Infection of cells with picornaviruses of the rhino- and enterovirus groups causes a shut-off in translation of cellular mRNAs but permits viral RNA translation to proceed. This change in translational specificity is thought to be mediated by proteolytic cleavage of eIF-4 gamma, which is catalyzed, directly or indirectly, by the picornaviral 2A protease. In this report we have used highly purified recombinant 2A protease from either human Coxsackievirus serotype B4 or rhinovirus serotype 2 to cleave eIF-4 gamma in vitro in the eIF-4 complex purified from rabbit reticulocytes. Neither the rate of cleavage nor fragment sizes were affected by addition of eIF-3. The NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments of eIF-4 gamma were separated by reverse phase HPLC and identified with specific antibodies, and the NH2-terminal sequence of the COOH-terminal fragment was determined by automated Edman degradation. The cleavage site for both proteases is 479GRPALSSR decreases GPPRGGPG494 in rabbit eIF-4 gamma, corresponding to 478GRTTLSTR decreases GPPRGGPG493 in human eIF-4 gamma."
https://openalex.org/W2028058416,"Cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR), a recently discovered metabolite of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), is a potent calcium-releasing agent postulated to be a new second messenger. An enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of cADPR from NAD and the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADP-ribose (ADPR) was purified to homogeneity from canine spleen microsomes. The net conversion of NAD to ADPR categorizes this enzyme as an NAD glycohydrolase. NAD glycohydrolases are ubiquitous membrane-bound enzymes that have been known for many years but whose function has not been identified. The results presented here suggest that these enzymes may function in the regulation of calcium homeostasis by the ability to synthesize and degrade cADPR."
https://openalex.org/W1558848958,"Stimulation of the acetylcholine muscarinic m2 receptor (m2R) expressed in Rat 1a fibroblasts results in the activation of the cytoplasmic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Concomitant with carbachol stimulation of the m2R was the activation of MEK (MAPK kinase) and Raf. MEK is the dual function kinase that phosphorylates and activates MAPK. Raf is a serine/threonine kinase capable of phosphorylating and activating MEK. Carbachol stimulation of the m2R also activated Ras. Pertussis toxin treatment of Rat 1a cells inhibited the m2R-mediated activation of Ras, Raf, MEK and MAPK. In contrast, epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated activation of Ras, Raf, MEK and MAPK was pertussis toxin-insensitive. m2R activation of Ras, Raf, and MAPK was insensitive to inhibition by genistein, while the epidermal growth factor receptor-induced responses were inhibited by genistein. The findings demonstrate that both Ras and Raf can be regulated by seven-membrane-spanning receptors that selectively couple to Gi proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1565516646,"In eukaryotic cells a number of different proteins with important regulatory functions are reversibly methyl-esterified at carboxyl-terminal prenylcysteine residues. These proteins include the low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, the gamma-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-proteins, and the nuclear lamins. The methylating enzymes that catalyze this type of carboxyl methylation reaction are integral membrane proteins, and the methylated protein products tend to be membrane-associated. Analyses of protein carboxyl methylation in a wide range of vertebrate tissues revealed a major carboxyl-methylated protein that was clearly distinct from those that are modified at prenylcysteine groups (Volker, C., Miller, R.A., McCleary, W.R., Rao, A., Poenie, M., Backer, J.M., and Stock, J.B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21515-21522). This M(r) = 36,000 protein is localized to the cytosol. Unlike the prenylcysteine methyltransferases, the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of the 36-kDa protein is found in the cytosol. The 36-kDa methylated protein has been purified from bovine brain. Sequence analysis of several peptides clearly shows that the protein is the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. A soluble 40-kDa methyltransferase that catalyzes the reaction has also been purified."
https://openalex.org/W1577600603,"L-type calcium channels mediate long-lasting calcium currents which are modulated by protein phosphorylation. Using site-directed anti-peptide antibodies, we show that the alpha 1 subunit of the neuronal class C L-type calcium channel from rat brain exists in two size forms. The longer form, LC2, with an apparent molecular mass of 210-235 kDa was phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cA-PK), but the shorter form, LC1, with an apparent molecular mass of 190-195 kDa was not a substrate for cA-PK. In contrast, LC1 and LC2 are both substrates for protein kinase C (PKC), calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cG-PK). The site-directed anti-peptide antibody CNC2 was produced against the COOH-terminal end of the class C L-type alpha 1 subunit as predicted by molecular cloning and sequencing of cDNA. CNC2 recognized LC2 but not LC1 by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitated only LC2 phosphorylated by either cA-PK or PKC. These results indicate that LC1 is truncated at its COOH-terminal end with respect to LC2 and that cA-PK preferentially phosphorylates sites in the COOH-terminal region of the alpha 1 subunit that are present in LC2 but not LC1. The selectivity of cA-PK for phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal region of LC2 suggests that the channel activities of the two alpha 1 subunit size forms may be differentially regulated by neurotransmitters and hormones which act through cAMP-dependent mechanisms, while both alpha 1 subunit isoforms may be modulated by PKC, cG-PK, and calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1487627529,"Ligand-induced internalization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors via a high affinity saturable pathway requires sequences located in the carboxyl terminus distal to the tyrosine kinase domain. Three regions were found to contain endocytic motifs as defined by their ability to restore internalization function to EGF receptors truncated at the distal border of the kinase domain at residue 958. Deletional analysis identified the sequence 996QQGFF as essential for function of the region encompassing residues 993-1022. QQGFF and the deduced sequence of the region encompassing residues 973-991 (973FYRAL) could effectively replace the endogenous endocytic code of the transferrin receptor (YTRF). FYRAL and YTRF were less active than QQGFF when substituted into region 993-1022 of the EGF receptor, but a synthetic sequence (NNAYF), predicted to have structural features of a tight turn, effectively replaced QQGFF for EGF receptor internalization. Whereas EGF receptor sequences functioned effectively in the transferrin receptor, function of these sequences in the EGF receptor was strictly dependent on intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity as demonstrated kinetically and by immunofluorescence using semithin cryosections. Ligand-dependent endocytosis and down-regulation of the EGF receptor thus require multiple sequence motifs that are exchangeable between ligand-dependent and -independent receptors, but that require intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity for function in the context of the EGF receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1575601729,"Two distinct but related cGMP-inhibited cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (cGI PDE) cDNAs were cloned from rat adipose tissue cDNA libraries. The open reading frame (3324 base pairs) of RcGIP1 encodes 1108 amino acids, including a hydrophobic membrane-associated domain in the NH2-terminal portion and, in the COOH-terminal portion, a putative catalytic domain conserved among all mammalian PDEs which is preceded by a putative regulatory domain that contains three consensus cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites and followed by a hydrophilic COOH-terminal domain. The carboxyl-terminal portion including the conserved domain was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and exhibited cAMP PDE activity which was inhibited by cilostamide, a specific cGI PDE inhibitor. RcGIP1 cDNA hybridizes strongly with RNA from isolated adipocytes, and its mRNA increases dramatically during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The deduced sequence of the second partial cDNA clone (RcGIP2 clone 53B) is highly homologous to the corresponding region of human cardiac cGI PDE cDNA. RcGIP2 cDNA hybridized strongly with rat cardiac tissue RNA and weakly if at all with RNA from rat adipocytes or 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or adipocytes. We suggest that RcGIP1 represents the hormone-sensitive, membrane-associated rat adipocyte cGI PDE and RcGIP2, a cGI PDE from vascular elements in rat adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1521352631,"Rat mucosal keratinocytes serially propagated under permanently serum-free conditions responded to interleukin (IL)-1 beta/IL-alpha and to transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha/epidermal growth factor (EGF) (as well as to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) by upregulation of M(r) 95,000 gelatinase (MMP-9) (M(r) 95K GL) and fibroblast-type collagenase (MMP-1) (FIB-CL), whereas control cells expressed barely detectable levels of either of these enzymes. The cells secreted 8-10 micrograms/10(6) cells/day (M(r) 95K GL) and 2-3 micrograms/10(6) cells/day (FIB-CL) of enzyme protein for at least 24 h when maximally induced. This level was attained only after a 24-h lag period, and the earliest emergence of enzyme protein in the culture medium required 10-14 h. IL-1 beta was by far the most potent cytokine with maximal effect already at 10(-10) M, whereas IL-1 alpha, TGF-alpha, and EGF required 20-100-fold higher concentrations. Pretreatment of the cells with TPA (10(-7) M) abolished the subsequent response to IL-1 beta, TGF-alpha, and EGF and at the same time resulted in > 90% reduction of cytosolic protein kinase C activity. Surprisingly, staurosporine, a potent kinase inhibitor, not only failed to block growth factor/cytokine responses but itself stimulated expression of the enzymes at a magnitude comparable to TPA. The inducing effect of TGF-alpha/EGF was down-regulated by 70-85% by 10(-7) M dexamethasone. Dexamethasone was less effective in ablating the IL-1 beta response yielding 60% reduction M(r) 95K GL and little or no reduction of FIB-CL. Dexamethasone also failed to block the TPA response."
https://openalex.org/W1486260470,"It has been suggested that mutations accumulated in mitochondrial DNA during the aging process may be causally related to the decreased physiological response of the senescent organisms. We have quantified and evaluated the integrity of the mitochondrial genome during the life span of Drosophila melanogaster. Its amount remains fairly constant representing roughly 1% of the total DNA at all ages. Southern experiments have also revealed a high stability and integrity of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). However, we have detected an important decrease in the steady-state levels of all mitochondrial transcripts investigated: 16 S ribosomal RNA (16SrRNA), cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome b, and beta H(+)-ATP synthase subunit. These changes correlate with the shape of the life span curve, preceding the decrease in survival of the male flies used in the study, and at least in the case of 16SrRNA, is tissue-specific. Although mitochondrial DNA remains unchanged in heads, thoraces, and abdomens, 16SrRNA levels decrease more severely in heads and thoraces and much less conspicuously in abdomens. On the other hand, control non-mitochondrial transcripts investigated remain essentially unaffected. These results suggest that in Drosophila the main effect of aging on the mitochondrial genetic system is downstream from mtDNA itself. The decline in the levels of beta H(+)-ATPase transcript, nuclear-encoded, suggests that not only the mitochondrial machinery, but also the nuclear one involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, is affected during aging."
https://openalex.org/W1548019355,"Peroxisome proliferators form a family of diverse xenobiotic compounds that includes hypolipidemic agents, herbicides, and plasticizers. These compounds activate transcription of a subset of nuclear genes including those encoding peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes, whose elevated activities can lead to hepatocarcinogenesis. Induction of the genes encoding fatty acyl-CoA oxidase and hydratase-dehydrogenase, the first and second enzymes of the pathway, is mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors (PPARs) that bind to upstream responsive elements (PPREs) through heterodimerization with retinoid X receptors. We demonstrate that the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 (COUP-TF1), another member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, binds to the hydratase-dehydrogenase PPRE in vitro and in vivo and antagonizes PPAR-dependent signaling. These data suggest that members of the COUP-TF family play a role in modulating receptor-mediated activation of peroxisome proliferator-responsive genes."
https://openalex.org/W1626626726,"We have identified two exons of the type III rat brain sodium channel alpha subunit gene that undergo mutually exclusive alternative RNA splicing to produce mRNAs coding either for an isoform predominant in neonatal brain (IIIN) or a different isoform (IIIA) predominant in the adult. These exons are 92 base pairs in length and encode amino acids 203-232, which correspond to part of the S3 and most of the S4 transmembrane segments within domain I and the extracellular loop between them. Despite 21 nucleotide differences between the exons, only a single amino acid at position 209 is altered, specifying either aspartic acid (IIIA) or serine (IIIN). As evidence that these isoforms are generated via alternative splicing, we demonstrate that both exons are encoded within the type III gene. The nucleotide sequences of the neonatal and adult type III exons and the intervening intron as well as the developmental regulation of this splicing are nearly identical in the type II sodium channel gene. The conservation of the exon/intron structure and of the developmentally regulated patterns of expression of the type II and III sodium channel genes suggests that alternative mRNA splicing of this exon may play a substantial role in modulating sodium channel function during brain development by alteration of a single amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W1483046275,"We have previously identified a novel xenobiotic responsive element, which has been termed the antioxidant responsive element (ARE), in the 5'-flanking region of the rat quinone reductase gene (Favreau, L. V., and Pickett, C. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4556-4561). This element is responsible for basal level expression of the gene as well as transcriptional activation by phenolic antioxidants and metabolizable planar aromatic compounds. In this communication, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide can act as an inducer through the ARE sequence, a phenomenon recently demonstrated for the glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene (Rushmore, T. H., Morton, M. R., and Pickett, C. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11632-11639). To further characterize the quinone reductase ARE, we demonstrate by DNase I footprinting that in crude Hep G2 nuclear extracts a trans-acting factor exists which interacts with a region of DNA found within the 31-nucleotide ARE sequence. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate the presence of a specific DNA-protein complex which can be competed only by double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the ARE sequences from the quinone reductase and glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit genes. Methylation interference and protection assays indicate that several guanine residues found in the sequence GTGACTTGGC are involved in the binding of the nuclear factor(s) to the DNA. Although electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the rat quinone reductase ARE does not contain a high affinity recognition site for in vitro translated c-Jun and c-Fos, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate can act as an inducer through the ARE sequence in Hep G2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1500465234,"This study reports the first demonstration of a marked reduction in alpha-crystallin chaperone activity in an experimental model of cataract, and the study implicates activation of the cysteine protease calpain II (EC 3.4.22.17) as the in vivo protease responsible for decreased chaperone activity. Chaperone activity of normal alpha-crystallin from lenses of young rats was assayed by measuring attenuation of heat-induced aggregation and scattering of beta L-crystallin. alpha-Crystallin from the nucleus of lenses with selenite cataract showed specific selective proteolysis, and chaperone activity was diminished. Proteolysis of alpha-crystallin from selenite cataract lenses was mimicked by incubating normal alpha-crystallin with calpain II, and this also resulted in loss of chaperone activity. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mapping were used to identify four partially degraded alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin polypeptides following incubation of normal alpha-crystallin with calpain. Similar partially degraded alpha A and alpha B polypeptides were found in selenite cataract. Previous experiments indicated that alpha-crystallin chaperone activity decreases because of removal of the COOH terminus. Our experiments support this observation and suggest that calpain proteolysis of alpha-crystallin at the COOH terminus may result in a loss of chaperone activity in selenite cataract."
https://openalex.org/W1573670866,"The macrolide antibiotic concanamycin B is a highly selective inhibitor (IC50 = 5 nM) of the H(+)-ATPases of the vacuolar system. We have examined the effects of concanamycin B on the constitutive secretory pathway of the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. In cells exposed to 10 nM concanamycin B, transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi occurs at normal rates, as determined by pulse-chase analysis of endoglycosidase H-sensitive product in conjunction with subcellular fractionation experiments. However, intra-Golgi trafficking or Golgi to plasma membrane delivery is significantly impaired. A delay in the onset of secretion of the major secretory proteins, albumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin and transferrin is observed. Processing of N-linked glycans by sialyltransferases is inhibited, resulting in secreted glycoproteins which are modified less extensively. In view of the acidic pH of the trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network, these studies suggest that acidification by vacuolar ATPases is critical to achieving timely secretion and correct N-linked glycan modifications of proteins which follow the constitutive secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1496561151,"Activins bind to two classes of cell surface proteins, type I receptors of approximately 50-55 kDa and type II receptors of approximately 70-75 kDa. The two cloned type II activin receptors belong to a new subfamily of transmembrane protein serine kinases. Antibodies directed against each of these cloned receptors were generated and used in immunoprecipitation experiments to study the properties of the type II receptors in vivo. Precipitation of affinity-labeled receptors, formed by chemical cross-linking of 125I-activin A, resulted in coprecipitation of type I receptor complexes; denaturation of the lysates prior to interaction with the antibodies resulted in precipitation of only type II receptors. Treatment of both affinity-labeled and metabolically labeled receptors with peptide N-glycosidase F revealed the presence of N-linked carbohydrate chains. Metabolic labeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate indicated that both type II receptors were phosphoproteins containing predominantly phosphoserine, with small amounts of phosphothreonine, but no detectable phosphotyrosine. Analysis of tryptic phosphopeptide maps of wild-type and kinase-defective mutants suggested that at least some of the phosphorylated sites arose from autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1570907413,"Juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (JHEH), which may play a pivotal role in regulating insect juvenile hormone (JH) titer along with JH esterase, was identified in tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) eggs by using photoaffinity analogs of JHs. The UV light-induced covalent labeling with [3H]epoxyhomofarnesyl diazoacetate, a JHII analog, revealed a membrane-associated 50-kDa protein that was selectively and specifically labeled. This 50-kDa protein was copurified 171-fold with the JHEH activity to homogeneity through DEAE-Sephacel, Mono Q, and hydroxylapatite columns, which led us to conclude that the labeled 50-kDa protein was a JHEH. The steady-state kinetics of the purified microsomal JHEH showed that it followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km values of 0.61, 0.55, and 0.28 microM for JHI, II, and III, respectively, and that JHIII showed a significantly higher Vmax than JHI or JHII. JH acid was also converted to the corresponding diol at a rate 4-fold slower than the corresponding JH. Thus, the differences in the binding of substrate and the rate of turnover by JHEH were affected by the epoxyfarnesoate ester moiety of JH and the difference between the cis-11-methyl group of JHIII versus the cis-11-ethyl group of JHI and II. Purified JHEH showed optimal enzyme activity at pH 7.5-8.5. Interestingly, the presence of recombinant M. sexta JH binding protein (JHBP) dramatically decreased the degradation of JH by JHEH in vitro. Since the cytosolic JHBP in eggs closely resembles the hemolymph JHBP, we suggest that cytosolic JHBP may play a role in protecting JHs from JHEH in vivo. Furthermore, JHEH may play a significant role in the secondary metabolism of JH acid generated by JH esterase."
https://openalex.org/W1529429366,"Thrombin stimulation of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells results in polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation, and DNA replication. Thrombin stimulation also activates Ras as assessed by an increase in the proportion of Ras in a GTP bound state. We examined the functional requirement for endogenous Ras protein in mediating thrombin-induced responses. Microinjection of a dominant interfering mutant of H-Ras into 1321N1 cells inhibited DNA synthesis in response to thrombin as did microinjection of an inhibitory antibody to Ras. Stimulation of AP-1-mediated transcriptional activity was also reduced by the expression of interfering Ras mutants. However, neither the stimulation of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis nor the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was dependent on endogenous Ras function. These observations indicate that thrombin stimulation of mitogenesis requires Ras protein function. Our data suggest that the G-protein-coupled thrombin receptor stimulates pathways, which in part are convergent with those stimulated by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1508622698,"Eukaryotic cellular proteins contain phosphohistidine. To search for protein histidine phosphatases, protein histidine kinase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to phosphorylate histone H4 on histidine at position 75 in the H4 amino acid sequence. Incubation of the phosphorylated histone H4 with either protein phosphatase 1, 2A, or 2C resulted in extensive removal of phosphate from the phosphorylated histone. Thus, protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2C are histidine phosphatases as well as serine/threonine phosphatases. Calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2B) did not remove phosphate from phosphohistidine. The histidine phosphatase reaction was tested for a magnesium requirement and effects of inhibitor-1 and okadaic acid. In all cases, the protein phosphatases behaved as they do in their serine/threonine phosphatase activity. Extracts of the yeast, S. cerevisiae, contain protein histidine phosphatase activity. Quantitative measurement of phosphatase activity shows that the activity against phosphohistidine is a major activity of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2C."
https://openalex.org/W1528545147,"beta-Alanine transport across intact human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cell layers has been investigated. In Na(+)-containing solutions, net absorptive flux of beta-alanine from apical-to-basal surfaces is small or absent, despite Na(+)-dependent intracellular beta-alanine accumulation across both apical and basal surfaces. Upon apical acidification (apical pH 6.0, basal pH 7.5), beta-alanine absorptive flux and accumulation across the apical surface are increased. In Na(+)-free conditions, a significant absorptive flux of beta-alanine is observed, which is markedly stimulated upon apical acidification (pH 6.0). Cellular accumulation of beta-alanine across the apical but not basal surface is observed in Na(+)-free conditions, and this is increased by acidic (pH 6.0) solutions. Absorptive beta-alanine flux in Na(+)-free conditions with acidic apical solutions displays saturation kinetics and competitive inhibition by alanine and glycine, but not valine or serine. Addition of 20 mM beta-alanine to the apical solution of epithelial monolayers loaded with the pH indicator 2‘,7‘-bis(2-carboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) causes a marked decrement in intracellular pH. beta-Alanine transport is also electrogenic, a concentration-dependent increase in an inward short circuit current being observed in voltage-clamped epithelial monolayers. We conclude that a proton-dependent, but Na(+)-independent, amino acid transporter is expressed at the apical membrane of human intestinal Caco-2 cells, and we provide direct evidence for amino acid-stimulated proton influx across the apical membrane in this intact epithelial cell system."
https://openalex.org/W124095406,"Mutated K-ras oncogenes have been detected in a third of lung adenocarcinomas, located usually in codon 12, its presence correlating negatively with survival. To further define the role of K-ras point mutations in non-small cell lung cancer, we studied the presence of mutated K-ras genes in surgical specimens from 66 patients. Polymerase chain reaction was performed from sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We screened for point mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of the K-ras gene by dot blot hybridization analysis with mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes. Ras gene mutations were present in 13 of 66 carcinomas (20%), nine in codon 12 and four in codon 61. Three squamous cell carcinomas harbored two different point mutations in K-ras codon 12. Mutated K-ras genes were found more frequently in squamous cell carcinomas (eight of 38) than in adenocarcinoma (three of 22). Analysis of nucleotide sequence disclosed a multifarious mutation pattern of K-ras codon 12, where the most common conversion was from glycine (GGT) to valine (GTT). K-ras point mutation positive subset had poorer survival, nine of the 13 patients died during the follow-up period as compared with 22 of 53 patients with no mutation in the K-ras gene (P = 0.01). The difference was also strikingly significant when stratified according to node status."

https://openalex.org/W1495656425,"COX13, the nuclear gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIa of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been isolated in two steps. First, the partial amino acid sequence information of the subunit was used to design two degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide primers to amplify part of the gene in a polymerase chain reaction. Next, the amplified product was used to screen a yeast genomic library in order to obtain the entire gene and its flanking sequences. COX13 is present as a single copy gene per haploid genome. Alignment of the N-terminal sequence of mature, subunit VIa with the amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence indicates that subunit VIa is synthesized as a precursor comprised of a leader sequence of 9 amino acid residues and a mature polypeptide of 120 amino acid residues. The mature polypeptide shares 34% identical amino acid residues with the human subunit isoform VIa-L. Sequence analysis of the 3'-flanking region of COX13 revealed that the gene is located 599 base pairs downstream of CDC55, a gene which has been mapped to the left arm of chromosome VII. Null mutants of COX13, generated by gene replacement, showed a slightly reduced growth rate on nonfermentable carbon sources. Heme spectra and analysis of immunopurified cytochrome c oxidase from a null strain demonstrated that the enzyme is fully assembled without subunit VIa. At low ionic strength, cytochrome c oxidase missing subunit VIa was more active, whereas at high ionic strength, it was less active than the enzyme complex in which subunit VIa was present. In addition, distinct effects of ATP on the activity of the null and wild type enzyme were found. The results suggest that ATP interacts specifically with subunit VIa and thereby modulates the cytochrome c oxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1566868787,"When amino acids Pro60B, Pro60C, and Trp60D are deleted from thrombin, the resulting mutant (des-PPW) exhibits (compared to the wild-type enzyme): a similar second order rate constant of inhibition (k(on)) for diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and a comparable inhibition constant (K(i)) for benzamidine, suggesting that the charge stabilizing system and the primary binding pocket are little altered, if at all, by the mutation. As predicted from the x-ray structure, des-PPW is remarkably sensitive to the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, with a K(i) over 3 x 10(3) times tighter relative to thrombin, but des-PPW is also markedly less susceptible to inactivation by antithrombin III, with a k(on) that is over 100-fold lower. The catalytic constant (kcat) for most p-nitroanilide substrates tested is preserved or even increased, but the Michaelis constant (Km) increases. In contrast, the Km for the fibrinogen A alpha-chain is essentially unchanged, whereas kcat decreases approximately 50-fold. Unlike thrombin, the rate of fibrinopeptide B release becomes, following a lag phase, comparable to that of fibrinopeptide A. Inasmuch as des-PPW cleaves an additional peptide bond in the bovine fibrin alpha-chain, it remains a highly specific serine protease, which releases a single peptide from denatured casein (versus two with thrombin). Protein C activation by des-PPW is approximately 30 times slower than by thrombin in the absence, as well as in the presence, of calcium and thrombomodulin. Although this study confirms that the B-insertion restricts access to the active site cleft, it also suggests that other motifs and/or discrete amino acids are mainly responsible for the narrow specificity of thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W1484956000,"Protein kinase C-theta (PKC-eta) is a member of the protein kinase C family that is characterized by Ca2+ independence and restricted histone kinase activity (Dekker, L. V., Parker, P. J., and McIntyre, P. (1992) FEBS Lett. 312, 195-199). Here we have investigated the molecular basis of this low histone kinase activity by limited proteolysis and site-directed mutagenesis. It is shown that a 46-kDa C-terminal tryptic fragment, representing the catalytic of PKC-eta, can phosphorylate histone. The Km value for histone of this catalytic fragment is 25-fold lower than that of intact PKC-eta. Thus, sites in the N-terminal regulatory upstream of the trypsin cleavage site (near residue 320) restrict histone kinase activity of intact PKC-eta. Deletion of the domain (residues 2-137) generates a PKC-eta mutant that shows the same cofactor dependence and substrate phosphorylation as wild-type PKC-eta, indicating that the relevant sites do not appear to lie in the Vo but between amino acid 137 and the start of the catalytic domain. Deletion of the pseudosubstrate region (residue 155-171) generates a cofactor-independent kinase that has high histone kinase activity. A pseudosubstrate site point mutation in which the alanine residue at position 161 is replaced with a glutamic acid residue shows the same properties as the pseudosubstrate site deletion mutant. Km values for histone for both mutants are similar to that observed for the catalytic fragment. Therefore, in addition to its role in conferring cofactor dependence, the pseudosubstrate site also mediates the low histone kinase activity of wild-type PKC-eta. The data are discussed in the light of current models for PKC activation."
https://openalex.org/W1542316191,"We have characterized a temperature-sensitive mutant in the yeast TOP2 gene that shows resistance to the anti-topoisomerase II agents amsacrine and etoposide. Cells carrying the top2-5 mutant have a minimum lethal concentration of amsacrine of greater than 100 micrograms/ml, compared to 10 micrograms/ml in isogenic wild-type cells, and a minimum lethal concentration of greater than 100 micrograms/ml etoposide, compared with 50 micrograms/ml for cells carrying wild-type topoisomerase II. We have cloned the top2-5 allele into a yeast vector that allows high level overexpression of the protein. As expected, the purified top2-5 activity is temperature-sensitive. The protein shows a 3-fold reduction of amsacrine-stabilized cleavage at the permissive temperature, confirming that the top2-5 protein is resistant to amsacrine in vitro. The protein also exhibits reduced cleavage in the presence of etoposide, with the largest effect at low concentrations of the drug. These results suggest that the top2-5 protein is altered in its sensitivity to anti-topoisomerase II agents. The relevant portion of the mutant allele has been sequenced, and several tightly clustered mutations have been identified. The location of the mutations identify a domain of the topoisomerase II protein that may be important in the interaction of the protein with anti-topoisomerase II anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2144699579,"Human and rat ciliary neurotrophic factors (CNTF), which share 85% sequence identity, promote the survival of chicken embryo ciliary ganglia neurons in vitro, but display a 4-5-fold difference in specific activity. To explore the origin of this difference and gain insight into the structural organization of CNTF, we created chimeric proteins of these two species. Surprisingly, we found that the differences in two apparently unrelated properties, gel mobility and specific activity, resided in a single amino acid. Substituting arginine residue 63 of rat CNTF into the human sequence created a protein with the properties of rat CNTF. Conversely, substituting the human CNTF glutamine residue 63 into rat CNTF generated a protein with the properties of human CNTF. Binding experiments confirmed that the distinct specific activities of human and rat CNTF and their chimeras reside in structural differences among these ligands rather than species differences in their receptors. Alanine substitution (Q63A) had no effect on the properties of human CNTF, whereas the R63A substitution reduced both the gel mobility and the specific activity of rat CNTF. Finally, a Q95R substitution at a different position of human CNTF had no effect on its properties. These results demonstrate that Arg-63 is both specific and critical in determining the structural differences of human and rat CNTF."
https://openalex.org/W1589357676,"Xanthine oxidase (XO) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), two forms of the same enzyme isolated from cow's milk, have differing redox potentials of their chromophores. Both XDH and XO are capable of accepting 8 electrons per active site cluster of redox acceptors. By titrating XDH with redox indicator dyes of various potentials, the potentials have been determined for the flavin as well as for the 2Fe/2S centers of the enzyme at pH 7.5, 25 degrees C. The redox potential for the FAD/FADH. half-potential was found to be -270 +/- 5 mV and that for the FADH./FADH2 half potential, -410 +/- 5 mV. The first flavin half potential is close to the value which has been reported for XO (Porras, A. G., and Palmer, G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11617-11626). However, the second FAD half-potential is 180 mV lower in XDH than in XO, creating a 140-mV separation between the FAD potentials in XDH. This separation gives rise to a maximum development of the flavin semiquinone in XDH near 0.9 equivalent as confirmed by EPR quantitation of FADH. formed during reductive titrations. The potentials of both the 2Fe/2S centers in XDH were determined and found to be identical to the values which were found for the iron-sulfur centers in XO."
https://openalex.org/W1710576323,"The liver-type and muscle-type isozymes of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose- 2,6-bisphosphatase are encoded by the same gene from different promoters. We have found earlier that the liver-type promoter is controlled by ubiquitous and liver-enriched transcription factors and that two cis-acting sequences, called sites III and IV, account for about half of the activity of this promoter (Lemaigre, F. P., Durviaux, S. M., and Rousseau, G. G. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 1099-1106). Site III contains the TGTTTGC sequence, i.e. the hepatocyte nuclear factor 5 motif, hepatocyte nuclear factor 5-TGTTTGC sequence motif, which is known to be functionally important in several liver-specific genes. We now show that site III actually binds the ubiquitous octamer factor 1 and the liver-enriched hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3) in a mutually exclusive way. We also show that site IV binds CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-related factors as well as another factor that is liver-specific. This factor is more abundant or has a higher affinity for site IV than the C/EBP-related proteins. Although it can bind to a high affinity HNF-3 site, this factor differs from known members of the HNF-3 family and from other liver-specific transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1612650248,"We have studied the kinetics of (+)-[3H]cis-diltiazem binding to L-type Ca2+ channels. The association reaction was of the second order with a rate constant of k1 = 5.3 x 10(-5) nM-1 min-1. A dissociation rate of the first order (k-1 = 0.0022 min-1) and the monophasic equilibrium binding curve (KD = 42 nM) seemed to reflect the simple case of one ligand binding to one site. However, when dissociation was monitored after isotopic rather than volume dilution, the dissociation rate constant increased with the concentration of added non-radioactive (+)-cis-diltiazem. Half-logarithmic plots were linear with rate constants of 0.0058, 0.011, 0.015, and 0.020 min-1 when 3, 10, 30, and 50 microM (+)-cis-diltiazem was added, respectively. We quantitatively analyzed our experimental data in terms of three different binding models, which can account for ligand-induced accelerated dissociation: 1) the classical allosteric model of pre-existing conformational states, 2) a general reaction scheme for two sites with negative cooperativity, and 3) competition of ligands for single attachment points within one binding site. Computer fitting of the experimental data to simplified reaction schemes derived from these models revealed that all three can be used to fit our data. However, only the multipoint attachment model does not require additional structural assumptions, not even an additional binding site, and is supported by structure-activity relationship analysis of diltiazem analogues. We conclude that ligand-induced accelerated dissociation should be a widely observed phenomenon that does not prove a non-competitive binding mechanism. Instead, it can be explained with the thermodynamics of non-covalent binding, where high affinity results from the cooperative interaction of a ligand molecule with multiple attachment points."
https://openalex.org/W137091985,"Abstract The mechanism for regulation of cholesterol esterification by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) was studied using the highly isolated enzyme from pig plasma. In the reaction with phosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicles, cholesterol, water, diacylglycerol, and lysophosphatidylcholine were all potent acceptors of an acyl group cleaved from the sn-2 position of egg phosphatidylcholine, generating cholesteryl ester, free fatty acid, triglyceride, and phosphatidylcholine, respectively. All of these reactions required activation by human apolipoprotein A-I, suggesting that this activation leads to the deacylation of phosphatidylcholine. Those acceptors competed against each other in this vesicle reaction system, and cholesterol was the most potent acyl acceptor. Lysophosphatidylcholine that was endogenously generated by deacylation of phosphatidylcholine in the first step of the LCAT reaction was also a good acyl acceptor, showing that the reaction is always partly idling. Bovine serum albumin partially inhibited this idling reaction in a concentration-dependent manner up to 80% at 0.60 mM. The above results were essentially reproducible with high density lipoprotein, except that cholesterol is less potent than lysophosphatidylcholine in accepting the acyl group under the condition used. Unlike the apolipoprotein A-I-activated reaction, cholesterol was esterified only slightly by the LCAT reaction on low density lipoprotein and, consequently, did not compete against lysophosphatidylcholine for generation of phosphatidylcholine. Thus, apoB may activate LCAT in a very different manner from apoA-I. The rate of esterification of lysophosphatidylcholine on low density lipoprotein was one-tenth of that on the vesicles and on high density lipoprotein. Thus, LCAT is active on low density lipoprotein but mostly idling as deacylating and reacylating glycerophospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1944176358,"The regulation of DNA topoisomerase I was studied in human T lymphocytes following phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation. As T lymphocytes began to enter the S phase 24 h after stimulation, there was a rapid increase in DNA topoisomerase I mRNA. The level of DNA topoisomerase I mRNA increased continuously over the next 18 h and peaked (> 50-fold increase) 42 h after stimulation with PHA. A concomitant increase in DNA topoisomerase I protein was also observed. However, the maximal increase in DNA topoisomerase I protein was only 6-fold. To explain the quantitative difference between the mRNA and protein levels, we investigated the change in the rates of DNA topoisomerase I protein synthesis versus degradation in human T lymphocytes following PHA stimulation. The increase in the mRNA parallels the increase in protein synthesis. However, the half-life of the enzyme protein was reduced to 9 h in proliferating T lymphocytes compared to a half-life of 36 h in resting lymphocytes. These results indicate that, in addition to the growth-regulated increase in the expression of DNA topoisomerase I, there was also a concomitant increase in the degradation of DNA topoisomerase I protein."

These receptors appeared to be functionally inert in that PAF failed to induce intracellular calcium mobilization in the cells. Following brief exposure of rats to ozone (2 ppm, 3 h), a pulmonary irritant and inflammatory agent that is rapidly converted to molecular oxygen, expression of PAF receptors was markedly up-regulated on lung phagocytes (13.1 x 10(3) binding sites/cell), with no significant effect on receptor affinity (Kd = 2.0 nM). In these cells, PAF, but not lyso-PAF, an inactive analog, caused a rapid and transient rise in intracellular calcium demonstrating that the PAF receptors were functionally active. The calcium response to PAF, which was largely due to mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores, was found to be dose-dependent in the nanomolar concentration range and inhibitable by the PAF receptor antagonist triazolam. The results of these studies may be important in elucidating mechanisms of lung inflammation induced by this model irritant."
https://openalex.org/W1581631173,"Although the central bases of the P22 operator are not contacted by P22 repressor, the affinity of repressor for operator varies with the sequence of these bases. The KMnO4 and .OH radical susceptibilities of the central bases of the operator vary with their sequence, whether or not the operator is complexed with protein or free in solution. These data show that the minor groove of a lower affinity operator which bears central C-G bases (9C) is more open than that of the higher affinity 9T operator, which bears central T-A bases. This difference in minor groove width is seen both in the absence and presence of repressor. Results of ring closure studies show that, in the absence of repressor, an operator bearing central C.G base pairs operator is overtwisted relative to an operator which contains central T.A base pairs. The binding of P22 repressor unwinds the two operators to similar extents, thereby preserving the relative differences in twists of these DNAs. Although repressor alters the twist of the operator DNA, our results show that differences in DNA torsional flexibility have no role in determining the affinity of operator for protein. Instead, the results indicate that central sequences affect operator affinity for protein by limiting the degree to which the operator can be deformed in the protein-DNA complex. The stability of the complex is apparently modulated, in a central sequence-dependent manner, by alterations in the number and/or geometry of protein-DNA contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1576220851,"The mechanism of regulated expression of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) by cAMP was investigated in the human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2. Incubation of HepG2 cells with the cell-permeant 8-bromo-cAMP or induction of intracellular cAMP with forskolin reduced receptor expression in confluent HepG2 cultures. Immunoblot analysis established that this reduction of receptor activity was due to a reduction of expression of both ASGR subunit polypeptides H1 and H2. Estimates of the steady-state levels of H1- and H2-related mRNA by Northern blot analysis indicated that reduced ASGR expression was a result of a decrease in gene transcript number. By a combination of run-on and mRNA turnover studies, it was suggested that this reduction of ASGR-related mRNA resulted from its destabilization induced by 8-bromo-cAMP. The effect of 8-bromo-cAMP appears not to be limited to ASGR expression as a rapid reduction in the albumin mRNA was also observed. In contrast, both the beta-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were elevated by exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1580387377,"Purified S-methyl-coenzyme M reductase (methylreductase) exhibits a very low fraction of its in vivo activity, suggesting either enzyme inactivation during cell lysis and chromatographic purification or the lack of an activating component in assay mixtures. Evidence that all methylreductase molecules in the purified protein can catalyze slow substrate turnover is found in a study of turnover-dependent in vitro incorporation of radiolabeled HS-CoM at the enzyme active site (Hartzell, P. L., Donnelly, M. I., and Wolfe, R. S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5581-5586). We have conducted active site titrations of purified methylreductase and of a highly active partially purified preparation (Rospert, S., Bocher, R., Albracht, S. P. J., and Thauer, R. K. (1991) FEBS Lett. 291, 371-375) using the reversible competitive inhibitor bromopropanesulfonate (K(i) = 0.05 microM). Curve fitting the data based on an equilibrium binding model shows that 0.1-1.4% of purified methylreductase has functional inhibitor binding sites while up to 25% of a highly active preparation binds the inhibitor. An EPR titration of highly active methylreductase with this inhibitor is consistent with this result, showing that the MCR-red1 and -red2 EPR signals (Albracht, S. P. J., Ankel-Fuchs, D., Bocher, R., Ellermann, J., Moll, J., van der Zwann, J. W., and Thauer, R. K. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 955, 86-102) are titrated in parallel with this active fraction. Attempts to observe turnover-dependent uptake of radiolabel from [thio-35S]2-methylthioethane-sulfonate by methylreductase were unsuccessful. These results suggest that the low activity of purified methylreductase is due primarily to low percentages of catalytically competent enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1513635327,"Despite the high overall similarity in primary structure between kringle one (K1) and kringle two (K2) of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) there exists an enormous functional difference. It is thought that, in contrast to K1, K2 mediates lysine binding and fibrin binding and is involved in stimulation of plasminogen activation by fibrin or derivatives as CNBr fragments of fibrinogen. Hypothesizing that sequence differences are responsible for differences in function, we compared the amino acid sequences of K1 and K2 with a consensus kringle sequence. Six consecutive amino acids unique to K2 of t-PA were found, i.e. from Asn248 to Trp253. To test whether these residues are involved in lysine binding, fibrin binding, and fibrin-dependent plasminogen activation, we constructed a set of t-PA mutant proteins containing only a kringle and the protease (P) domain: K2P, K1P, and k1P. In the latter molecule the original amino acid residues Ala160- Ser165 from K1 were substituted by Asn248-Trp253 from K2. As expected, K2P showed enhanced plasminogen activation in the presence of CNBr fragments of fibrinogen, bound to lysine-Sepharose and to a forming fibrin clot. K1P did not show any of these features. In contrast, k1P could be stimulated by CNBr fragments of fibrinogen and bound to lysine-Sepharose and a forming fibrin clot. These results indicate that at least a part of the functional differences between K1 and K2 of t-PA can be localized to a stretch of 6 amino acid residues from Asn248 to Trp253 present in K2.

https://openalex.org/W1522300298,"Glucocorticoids coincidentally regulate the localization of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) glycoproteins and maturation of viral phosphoproteins in viral infected rat hepatoma cells. To test for a functional interaction between MMTV transmembrane glycoproteins and cytoplasmic phosphoproteins, the bacterial cytolysin streptolysin-O was utilized to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane and reconstitute exocytic trafficking. Streptolysin-O-permeabilized M1.54 cells pretreated with glucocorticoids retained the capability for proteolytic processing, cell surface delivery, and externalization of MMTV glycoproteins as determined by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy. The efficient maturation of MMTV phosphoproteins indicated that these viral proteins are properly transported near or to the plasma membrane in permeabilized cells. These maturation events in semi-intact cells were dependent on the addition of cell cytosol and were specifically inhibited by the membrane impermeant GTP analog guanosine 5'3-O-(thio)triphosphate, an agent known to impede vesicular transport of membrane proteins, but which has not previously been shown to alter cytoplasmic protein maturation or transport. The addition of anti-MMTV antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein precursor to transport competent semi-intact M1.54 cells resulted in the dramatic inhibition of both MMTV glycoprotein and phosphoprotein maturation. These results were not obtained using either preimmune sera or antiserum specific for the luminal portion of the glycoprotein precursor. Our findings suggest that the functional interaction of cytosolic MMTV phosphoproteins with the cytoplasmic domain of the viral membrane glycoprotein is required for the efficient transport and processing of each class of proteins in glucocorticoid-treated cells and provides the first evidence for the involvement of vesicular transport in the delivery and maturation of cytoplasmic viral proteins at the plasma membrane or the pericellular region."
https://openalex.org/W1581059226,"The amino acid residue Arg57 of Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase is located in the carbamoyl phosphate-binding domain of the enzyme. This residue has been implicated to be critical for efficient carbamoylation and is linked to an induced-fit protein isomerization elicited by the lead substrate carbamoyl phosphate. To elucidate its role in substrate binding and catalysis, Arg57 has been substituted by one of two amino acids, glycine and histidine, varying in size and charge. Elimination of the positive charge and steric bulk on residue 57 with an arginine-to-glycine substitution results in an enzyme which binds its substrates in a random order (Kuo, L. C., Miller, A. W., Lee, S., and Kozuma, C. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8823-8832). Replacement of Arg57 by histidine provides a substantial portion of the steric bulk at this residue position and also brings the pKa of this residue into an experimentally observable window. Kinetic and pH titration experiments reveal that when His57 is deprotonated the enzyme binds its substrates randomly. However, when His57 is protonated the enzyme observes the obligatory substrate binding order as seen for the wild type. Both the Gly57 and His57 point mutants are incapable of undergoing the carbamoyl phosphate-induced protein conformational changes apparent in the wild type. These results reveal that the induced-fit isomerization of ornithine transcarbamoylase does not contribute to the order in which the substrates bind. A comparison of the reaction schemes and pH profiles of the wildtype and His57 enzymes further indicates that protonation of residue 57 facilitates formation of the binary enzyme-carbamoyl phosphate complex and augments the turnover rate of the reaction. Together with steady-state kinetic parameters derived in terms of microscopic rate constants, our results provide additional support to our earlier suggestion (Zambidis, I. and Kuo, L. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2620-2623) that the turnover rate of the wild-type ornithine transcarbamoylase in the forward reaction is largely dictated by the rate of the carbamoyl phosphate-induced isomerization."

Chemical analyses of the reoxidized proteins revealed that the disulfide peptides corresponding to the six native protein disulfides (SS-I, SS-II, SS-III, SS-IV, SS-V, and SS-VI) are all regained in the reoxidized protein. The peptide recoveries from the reoxidized proteins were, however, about half of those from the native protein with respect to the two inner disulfides (SS-IV and SS-V) in the kringle bridges, but all the disulfide peptides corresponding to the remaining disulfides (SS-I, SS-II, SS-III, and SS-VI) were recovered at almost equivalent yields in the native and reoxidized proteins. In addition, on searching for a nonnative disulfide peptide, the two disulfides, Cys171-Cys174 and Cys174-Cys182, which can be accounted for by mispaired bridges of sulfhydryls in SS-IV and SS-V, were detected in the protein reoxidized with oxidized dithiothreitol. Upon disulfide reduction of the native protein with reduced dithiothreitol, both SS-IV and SS-V were selectively cleaved under the same buffer and temperature conditions as in the oxidative refolding. The lower stabilities of the two inner disulfide bonds in the kringle may be related to the lower recoveries of the disulfide peptides from SS-IV and SS-V and the generation of the nonnative disulfide bonds."
