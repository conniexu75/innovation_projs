https://openalex.org/W2046493105,"ABCA1, an ATP-binding cassette transporter mutated in Tangier disease, promotes cellular phospholipid and cholesterol efflux by loading free apoA-I with these lipids. This process involves binding of apoA-I to the cell surface and phospholipid translocation by ABCA1. The goals of this study were to examine the relationship between ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux and apolipoprotein binding and to determine whether phospholipid and cholesterol efflux are coupled. Inhibition of lipid efflux by glybenclamide treatment or by mutation of the ATP-binding cassette of ABCA1 showed a close correlation between lipid efflux, the binding of apoA-I to cells, and cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1. The data suggest that a functionally important apoA-I binding site exists on ABCA1 and that the binding site could also involve lipids. After using cyclodextrin preincubation to deplete cellular cholesterol, ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux was abolished but phospholipid efflux and the binding of apoA-I were unaffected. The conditioned media from cyclodextrin-pretreated, ABCA1-expressing cells readily promoted cholesterol efflux when added to fresh cells not expressing ABCA1, indicating that cholesterol efflux can be dissociated from phospholipid efflux. Further, using a photoactivatable cholesterol analog, we showed that ABCA1 did not bind cholesterol directly, even though several other cholesterol-binding proteins specifically bound the cholesterol analog. The data suggest that the binding of apoA-I to ABCA1 leads to the formation of phospholipid-apoA-I complexes, which subsequently promote cholesterol efflux in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.

Epidemiological studies have shown a strong inverse relationship between HDL levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (1Rhoads G.G. Gulbrandsen C.L. Kagan A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Although detailed mechanisms remain unclear, one theory to explain the protective role of HDL is the reverse cholesterol transport hypothesis, which holds that HDL facilitates the transfer of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells to the liver for secretion into bile (2Glomset J.A. Adv. Intern. Med. 1980; 25: 91-116PubMed Google Scholar). The initial step in this process is the release of free cholesterol and phospholipid from the plasma membranes of macrophage foam cells to both apolipoproteins and HDL (3Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in Tangier disease (TD), an inherited HDL deficiency state characterized by cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages, have shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for cellular cholesterol efflux (4Brooks-Wilson A.

These studies identifiedABCA1, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, as the mutated gene in TD, providing a potential explanation for the cellular defect in cholesterol and phospholipid efflux characteristic of TD subjects (7Francis G.A.

We and others have recently reported that ABCA1 expression in cultured cells, achieved either by introducing the ABCA1 cDNA or by cAMP treatment, increases cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) (8Wang N.

Chemical cross-linking analysis reveals complex formation between apoA-I and ABCA1 (8Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 9Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux is still poorly understood. Whereas ABCA1 has been proposed to be a phospholipid translocase/flippase (8Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 12Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether ABCA1 directly promotes cholesterol efflux or acts by an indirect mechanism. The present study was undertaken to examine the relationship between lipid efflux and apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and the coupling of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to phospholipid efflux. The data suggest that ABCA1 acts primarily as a phospholipid translocase, an activity that is closely associated with the binding of apoA-I to ABCA1. However, cholesterol efflux can be dissociated completely from phospholipid efflux and appears to be mediated indirectly by ABCA1. These data provide the first direct evidence that ABCA1 functions as a cholesterol efflux regulatory protein. Human apoA-I was obtained commercially (BioDesign). Anti-Flag antibodies, glybenclamide, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, and sodium orthovanadate were from Sigma. Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) was from Pierce. Plasmid construct with full-length murine ABC1 cDNA or cDNA encoding ABCA1-Flag were constructed as described (8Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). ABCA1-M-Flag was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis, which created a missense mutation of K939M and disrupted the first Walker A motif of ABCA1. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. One day before transfection, the cells were plated on 6- or 24-well plates coated with collagen. The next day, cells at about 95% confluence were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and corresponding plasmid constructs. For lipid efflux assays, cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml 1,2-[3H]cholesterol or 1 μCi/ml methyl-[3H]choline on the same day as cell transfection. 24 h after transfection and labeling, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with DMEM plus 0.2% fatty acid free bovine albumin (DMEM/BSA). The media were then replaced with fresh DMEM/BSA in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of apoA-I or HDL2 and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The media were collected and counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (cholesterol efflux assay) or extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3:2) solution and then counted (phospholipid efflux assay). Cells were dissolved with 0.1 n NaOH and 0.2% SDS (cholesterol efflux) or extracted with hexane/isopropanol solution (phospholipid efflux) to determine residual radioactivity remaining in cells. For lipid efflux assays with conditioned media, cells expressing ABCA1 were pretreated with 20 mm2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min, and then the washed cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml apoA-I for 4 h at 37 °C. The conditioned media were transferred to cells transfected with the control vector (mock cells) or ABCA1 vector, and cholesterol efflux during a 4-h incubation was determined. ApoA-I was iodinated with [125I]iodide by Iodo-Gen (Pierce) to a specific activity of ∼1300 cpm/ng apoA-I. Cells grown on 24-well plates were incubated on ice or at 37 °C for 90 min in DMEM/BSA with 1.0 μg/ml labeled apoA-I in the presence or absence of 50-fold excess of unlabeled ligands. Cells were then washed rapidly four times with ice-cold DMEM/BSA and dissolved with 0.1 n NaOH and 0.2% SDS, the protein content was measured with a modified Lowry method, and bound iodinated ligands were determined by gamma counting. Chemical cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, immunoblot and autoradiography analysis of [125I]apoA-I-ABCA1 complexes, biotinylated cell surface ABCA1, and total cellular ABCA1 were carried out as described (8Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Labeling HEK293 cells with [3H]photocholesterol and [3H]photophosphatidylcholine as well as UV-dependent photoaffinity cross-linking were performed as described (13Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To evaluate the relationship between the lipid efflux activities of ABCA1 and apoA-I binding and cross-linking to the transporter, we used several compounds that are known to affect ABC transporter activities (14Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. J. Gen.

Physiol. 1999; 437: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Glybenclamide, a sulfonylurea derivative, is an effective inhibitor of several ABC transporters including CFTR (15Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 573-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), MDR (16Golstein P.E. Boom A. van Geffel J. Jacobs P. Masereel B. Beauwens R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and ABCA1 (14Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of this compound on ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux and apoA-I binding. Glybenclamide (1 mm) abolished ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux (Fig.1 A) and markedly inhibited cholesterol efflux (Fig. 1 B). Vanadate, an inhibitor of MDR shown in some studies to be an inhibitor of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (17Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), had no major effect on ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux. The enhanced binding of apoA-I to cells expressing ABCA1 and cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1 were abolished by glybenclamide treatment (Fig. 1,C and F), demonstrating a close relationship between binding and lipid efflux. Glybenclamide treatment did not alter the level of total cellular ABCA1 and the level of ABCA1 presented to the cell surface, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of cell samples subjected to cell surface biotinylation and ABCA1-specific immunoprecipitation (data not shown). To test the specificity of glybenclamide in ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux, we examined cholesterol efflux to HDL. ABCA1 expression failed to promote cholesterol efflux to HDL2 (Fig. 1 D). HDL2-mediated cholesterol efflux was unaffected in glybenclamide-treated cells with or without ABCA1 expression (Fig. 1 E), indicating specificity. These data show a parallel inhibition of phospholipid and cholesterol efflux by glybenclamide and indicate that lipid efflux is closely related to apoA-I binding to cells and to cross-linking to ABCA1. To further evaluate the relationship between lipid efflux and apoA-I binding to ABCA1, we made a Walker motif mutant (ABCA1-M) of ABCA1 that disrupts the first ATP binding site of the transporter. ABCA1-M was expressed and presented to the cell surface at a level similar to ABCA1, as determined by cell surface biotinylation/immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis (Fig.2, B and C). However, ABCA1-M failed to promote cholesterol and phospholipid efflux as well as apoA-I binding (data not shown). Cross-linking analysis revealed no complex formation between apoA-I and ABCA1-M even though complexes between apoA-I and ABCA1 (wild type) were produced under similar conditions (Fig. 2 A). These data confirm that both the phospholipid and cholesterol efflux activities of ABCA1 are closely correlated with binding of apoA-I as recently suggested (18Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, they also demonstrate that cross-linking of apoA-I to ABCA1 is abolished by the Walker motif mutation of the transporter, or by glybenclamide treatment, indicating that a functionally important binding site is created by ABCA1, which may involve ABCA1 itself. ABCA1 has been shown to increase the presentation of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the outer leaflet of the cell membrane (12Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and the enhanced presentation of PS has been suggested to play a functional role in cholesterol efflux (12Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 18Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To evaluate the proposed role of PS, we carried out the cholesterol efflux assay in the presence of excess amount of annexin V (5 μm), a membrane PS-binding protein (19Meers P. Daleke D. Hong K. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2903-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that has been shown to have an increased cell surface association in ABCA1 expressing cells (12Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect any effect on ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (Fig. 3), indicating that membrane PS translocation may not be involved in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Our results are consistent with a previous report that glybenclamide blocked phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and sphingolipid transfer from cultured cells to apoA-I but had little effect on PS transfer (17Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The above data suggest that both the phospholipid and cholesterol efflux activities of ABCA1 are closely related to binding of apoA-I to the transporter. In an attempt to dissociate phospholipid and cholesterol efflux activities, we used 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, an efficient cellular cholesterol acceptor (20Irie T. Otagiri M. Sunada M. Uekama K. Ohtani Y. Yamada Y. Sugiyama Y. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1982; 5: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 20 mmcyclodextrin for 30 min resulted in the recruitment of ∼55% of total cellular cholesterol label in both ABCA1-expressing and mock-transfected cells (Fig.4 D). This treatment abolished ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux and apoA-I binding were not affected by cholesterol depletion (Fig. 4, A and C). We also determined the dose relationship between cyclodextrin treatment and cholesterol efflux. As the cyclodextrin concentration increased in the pretreatment, cellular cholesterol pools and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux were proportionally decreased (Fig. 4 D). These findings show that ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux to apoA-I can be completely dissociated from cholesterol efflux. They also indicate that the availability of cholesterol for efflux is not a requirement for apoA-I binding. Although cyclodextrin preincubation abolished ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, the promotion of cholesterol efflux by cyclodextrin was independent of ABCA1, because ABCA1 overexpression did not alter cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol efflux over a range of 10 μm to 10 mm of this reagent (data not shown). These findings are consistent with a previous report on cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophage-like J774 cells treated with a cAMP analog (10Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H. Stoudt G. Hoppe K.L. Royer L.J. McNeish J. Francone O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28634-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To further test the relationship between phospholipid and cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1, we examined the ability of photoactivatable phosphatidylcholine and photoactivatable cholesterol to directly bind ABCA1 in living cells. These photoactive lipids have recently been developed as highly specific probes to identify cholesterol binding proteins (13Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). [3H]Photocholesterol was added to cells or [3H]photophosphatidylcholine was synthesized in cells expressing ABCA1-Flag. Photoaffinity labeling of ABCA1-Flag was activated by UV irradiation followed by the immunoprecipitation of ABCA1-Flag. The lipid binding to ABCA1 was detected by fluorography. Interestingly, although ABCA1 could promote the efflux of photoactive cholesterol (Fig.5 D), no photoactive cholesterol binding to ABCA1 was detected (Fig. 5 A). Under similar conditions, the specific binding of photoactive cholesterol to scavenger receptor BI, a plasma membrane receptor involved in HDL cholesteryl ester uptake and cellular cholesterol efflux (21Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 22Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), was readily detected 2D. L. Silver, N. Wang, C. Thiele, and A. R. Tall, manuscript in preparation. as well as binding of photocholesterol to caveolin (13Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that ABCA1 may bind cholesterol only in the presence of apoA-I, cells were incubated with apoA-I for 2 h before UV irradiation. Under these conditions, photoactive cholesterol binding to ABCA1 was still not detected (data not shown). In contrast to photoactive cholesterol, photoactive phospholipid bound to ABCA1 and was cross-linked by UV irradiation (Fig. 5 C). However, this binding appeared not to depend on the phospholipid translocase activity of ABCA1, because the mutant ABCA1-M bound photoactive phospholipid as well as the wild type (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that ABCA1 is localized in a phospholipid-rich and cholesterol-poor region of the membrane. These data could indicate that ABCA1 does not directly bind and transport cholesterol and that ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux occurs secondary to phospholipid efflux. To further explore this hypothesis, we used cyclodextrin preincubation to block the cholesterol efflux but not phospholipid efflux to apoA-I in HEK293 cells expressing ABCA1 and then transferred the conditioned media to a second set of cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol. The cells receiving conditioned media were either mock-transfected or transfected with ABCA1. The conditioned media readily promoted cholesterol efflux from mock cells, albeit slightly less efficiently than from ABCA1-expressing cells (Fig.5 E). These results demonstrate that the nascent apoA-I/phospholipid particles generated by ABCA1 can promote cellular cholesterol efflux in an ABCA1-independent fashion. In this study we examined the relationship between ABCA1-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux and the correlation between ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux and the binding of apoA-I to the cell surface. Using cyclodextrin preincubation, we demonstrated that ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux could be dissociated completely from phospholipid efflux. Further, we showed that cholesterol efflux could occur subsequent to phospholipid efflux even in the absence of ABCA1 expression. Direct evidence that ABCA1 does not bind cholesterol was obtained by use of a novel photoactivatable cholesterol analog, which by contrast labels selected cholesterol-binding plasma membrane proteins (13Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that ABCA1 acts primarily as a phospholipid translocase and may not directly transport cholesterol. Together, the data suggest that ABCA1 functions in vivo as a cholesterol efflux regulatory protein that promotes cholesterol efflux in an indirect fashion. Our studies also suggest a close relationship between lipid efflux and apoA-I binding. We showed by chemical cross-linking that the binding site is close to ABCA1 (within 12 Å) and may involve a direct interaction with ABCA1. The functional significance of this binding site is attested to by its abolition in the ABCA1-M mutant or following glybenclamide treatment. ABCA1-M failed to mediate apoA-I binding and cross-linking to the transporter, indicating a requirement for functional ABCA1 in apoA-I binding/cross-linking. Together with the finding that glybenclamide blocks lipid efflux and apoA-I binding, the data could be interpreted as suggesting the necessity of phospholipid translocation for apoA-I binding. However, lipids alone may not be sufficient for apoA-I binding. ABCA1 itself may also be involved in creating the binding site. This may potentially explain why ABCA1, but not other phospholipid translocases such as Mdr2 (23Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. Ottenhoff R. van der Lugt N.M. van Roon M.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), acts as abona fide transporter to mediate lipid efflux to apoA-I. One possible interpretation is that both ABCA1 and the phospholipid substrate of the transporter are required for apoA-I binding. Using a fluorescence-based assay and transfection with ABCA1-GFP as well as a Walker motif mutant of ABCA1-GFP, Chambenoit et al. (18Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) recently concluded that binding of apoA-I involved only membrane lipids but not ABCA1 itself. However, the suggestion that apoA-I binds only to membrane lipids but not ABCA1 cannot be reconciled readily with the previous findings that apoA-I binding to the cell surface was not reduced in fibroblasts from some TD subjects (24Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the latter study, the fibroblasts from some TD patients showed a markedly decreased cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apoA-I without significant change of the apoA-I binding (24Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Of particular interest was the finding that the enhanced binding of apoA-I in fibroblasts loaded with cholesterol, a condition known to increase ABCA1 expression (17Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), was also not affected in the TD cells (24Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), while lipid efflux was markedly reduced, indicating a dissociation of ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux from apoA-I binding. These data suggest an alternative interpretation, i.e. that ATP binding/hydrolysis induces a conformational change of ABCA1 leading to apoA-I binding and phospholipid efflux. Both the Walker motif mutant and glybenclamide treatment could prevent such a conformational change. There is previous evidence that ATP binding/hydrolysis is associated with conformational changes of ABC transporters (25Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For instance, in the maltose transport system of Escherichia coli, the ATP hydrolysis cycle is coupled with a conformational change of the ABC transporter that is crucial in regulating the binding of the transporter to maltose binding protein and maltose transport (26Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The failure of ABCA1 to bind photocholesterol and the enhanced cholesterol efflux by ABCA1-conditioned media in the absence of ABCA1 expression indicate an indirect mechanism for ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. This scenario is supported by the current models for certain ABC transporters. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions as a chloride channel but seems to have other activities, in addition to conducting chloride, that are essential for normal fluid and electrolyte transport (27Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 28Vankeerberghen A. Wei L. Jaspers M. Cassiman J.J. Nilius B. Cuppens H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Some of the effects of CFTR on regulating electrolyte transport appear to be indirectly mediated by regulating the function of other ion transporters (27Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G.

Murine Mdr2, another ABC transporter, acts as a specific phospholipid translocase indirectly promoting cholesterol secretion into bile (23Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K.

These precedents, as well as data herein, suggest that ABCA1 functions as a cholesterol efflux regulatory protein and promotes cholesterol efflux in an indirect fashion. Dissociation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from phospholipid efflux suggests that these two processes can be regulated independently. One potential physiological implication of these findings could be related to the generation of phospholipid-rich, cholesterol-poor nascent HDL by liver and small intestine (30Hamilton R.L. Williams M.C. Fielding C.J. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 31Winkler K.E. Marsh J.B. J.

Recent studies demonstrate that hepatocytes express ABCA1 (33Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Couse T.L. Wilcox J.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hepatic ABCA1 may be involved in nascent HDL production by facilitating transfer of phospholipids to apoA-I. Once they reach peripheral tissues, these nascent HDL particles could promote cholesterol efflux. Prior to the discovery of ABCA1, Li et al. (34Li Q. Tsujita M. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12045-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggested that phospholipid and cholesterol efflux mediated by apoA-I may be distinctly regulated. A two-step mechanism for cholesterol and phospholipid efflux has also been proposed in which the authors suggest that apoA-I/phospholipid particles promote cholesterol efflux from caveolae (17Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, we have observed that co-transfection of HEK293 cells with ABCA1 and caveolin-1 blocked ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux by an unknown mechanism. 3N. Wang, D. L. Silver, and A. R. Tall, unpublished observation. Although an indirect mechanism of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux was indicated by our study, the efflux of cholesterol promoted by the conditioned media from mock cells was slightly less efficient than the efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells (Fig. 4 F), suggesting that ABCA1 may have an additional role in coordinating cholesterol and phospholipid efflux. ABCA1 expression promotes cholesterol efflux to apoA-I but not to HDL2 or cyclodextrin, indicating specificity of the transporter-mediated cholesterol efflux. One layer of the specificity probably comes from the specific transfer of phospholipid to apoA-I. Earlier in vitro studies demonstrate that phospholipids are required for apoA-I to form complexes with cholesterol (35Vaughan D.J. Breckenridge W.C. Stanacev N.Z. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ABCA1-mediated specific phospholipid efflux to apoA-I is likely to prime apoA-I for subsequent cholesterol efflux. In summary, data from this study indicate that ABCA1 functions primarily as a phospholipid translocase. Although ABCA1-mediated PS translocation might be important for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (18Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), it does not appear to be required for cholesterol efflux. ATP binding/hydrolysis on ABCA1 probably induces a conformational change of the transporter, which leads to the binding of apoA-I and phospholipid translocation. The binding site may consist of phospholipids and ABCA1 itself. Recent studies suggest that an N-terminal ∼600-amino acid segment of ABCA1, with clustered loss of function mutations in TD subjects, is located extracellularly (37Fitzgerald M.L. Mendez A.J. Moore K.J. Andersson L.P. Panjeton H.A. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17137-17145Google Scholar). Potentially, this segment could be involved in apoA-I binding. Once apoA-I recruits phospholipids translocated by ABCA1, the nascent complexes promote cholesterol efflux in an autocrine, paracrine, or even endocrine fashion, perhaps from specific pools of cellular cholesterol."

Here we show that the mouse E12/E47 basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (the E2A gene product) acts as a repressor of E-cadherin expression and triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. The mouse E47 factor was isolated in a one-hybrid system designed to isolate repressors of the mouse E-cadherin promoter. Epithelial cells ectopically expressing E47adopt a fibroblastic phenotype and acquire tumorigenic and migratory/invasive properties, concomitant with the suppression of E-cadherin expression. Suppression ofE-cadherin expression under stable or inducible expression of E47in epithelial cells occurs at the transcriptional level and is dependent on the E-boxes of the E-cadherinpromoter. Interestingly, analysis of endogenous E2Aexpression in murine and human cell lines illustrated its presence in E-cadherin-deficient, invasive carcinoma cells but its absence from epithelial cell lines. This expression pattern is consistent with that observed in early mouse embryos, where E2A mRNA is absent from epithelia but strongly expressed in the mesoderm. These results implicate E12/E47 as a repressor of E-cadherinexpression during both development and tumor progression and indicate its involvement in the acquisition and/or maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype.

Indeed, the loss of E-cadherin-mediated intercellular interactions is required for the acquisition of the invasive phenotype in epithelial tumors (8Takeichi M. Curr. Opin.

Therefore, characterization of the molecular mechanisms that controlE-cadherin down-regulation is of prime importance for the understanding of both the tumor invasion process and normal embryonic development.Different mechanisms have been proposed to participate in the silencing of E-cadherin expression during tumor progression, including genetic and epigenetic alterations of theE-cadherin locus (11Berx G.

With regard to the latter hypothesis, previous studies on the mouse E-cadherinpromoter have shown that a palindromic element, E-pal, containing two adjacent E-boxes, behaves as a strong repressor inE-cadherin-deficient carcinoma cells and fibroblasts (16Hennig G. Lowrick O. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 595-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,19Behrens J. Lowrick O. Klein-Hitpass L. Birchmeier W. Proc.

Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Very recently, we have carried out a yeast one-hybrid screening to identify transcriptional repressors that interact with this E-pal element leading to the identification of the zinc finger transcription factor Snail as a direct repressor ofE-cadherin expression (21Cano A.

Here, a second factor isolated in the same screening process is described which corresponds to the mouse bHLH factor E47 (22Walker M.D. Park C.W. Rosen A. Aronheim A.

Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence indicates that the E2A gene products play a central role in tissue-specific gene regulation, usually after their dimerization with tissue-specific class II bHLH proteins (28Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 29Lee J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 30Engel I. Murre C. Curr.

Nevertheless, homodimers of E47 bHLH proteins are functionally active in B-cell lineages where they participate in the transcriptional regulation of several Ig genes (32Shen C.P. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4518-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In fact the products of E2A gene (E12/E47) are required for B-cell differentiation and Ig gene rearrangements (33Zhuang Y. Soriano P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In addition, targeted disruption of the E2A gene leads to thymic lymphomas, suggesting that E2A gene products can act as tumor suppressors (34Bain G. Maandag E.C. Izon D.J. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. Weintraub B.C. Krop I. Schlissel M.S. Feeney A.J. van Roon M. van der Valk M. te Riele H. Berns A. Murre C.

The transcriptional activity of E2A proteins can be negatively regulated by their dimerization with another subclass of HLH factors, the Id proteins (36Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Additional class I bHLH members are coded by independent genes such as HEB and E2-2(37Hu J.S. Olson E.N. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 38Henthorn P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out and knock-in analysis indicates that these gene products can functionally cooperate with, or substitute for,E2A (39Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 40Zhuang Y. Barndt R.J. Pan L. Kelley R. Dai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3340-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that E12/E47 proteins are distributed widely in most adult tissues although at different levels of expression (26Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kawamori R. Kamada T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, analysis of E12/E47 expression has not been undertaken in epithelial tissues or cell lines. Using a combination of expression studies, band-shift assays, promoter analysis, and gain-of-function experiments in epithelial cells, evidence of a novel role for E12/E47 is provided here. We show that E12/E47 participates in the repression of E-cadherinexpression and in the EMT process, leading to the acquisition of invasive properties. These results further reinforce the significance of transcriptional repression as a mechanism for E-cadherindown-regulation during both development and tumor progression.DISCUSSIONLoss of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion is one of the hallmarks of the invasion process which occurs during the initial stages of the metastatic cascade. A large body of evidence points toE-cadherin as an invasion suppressor gene. This has stimulated investigation into the molecular mechanisms responsible forE-cadherin down-regulation during tumor progression. The recent identification of the transcription factor Snail as a powerful direct repressor of E-cadherin expression in carcinoma cell lines (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar, 49Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia De Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar) has highlighted the importance of transcriptional repression as a mechanism to silence E-cadherin. Previous studies on the regulation of E-cadherin by Snailindicate that during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions the same molecules and regulatory mechanisms are utilized for the same cellular processes during normal embryonic development and in pathological events in the adult such as cancer progression (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that a second transcription factor, the class I bHLH E12/E47 factor, coded by the E2A gene, is also involved in the suppression of E-cadherin expression and in EMTs. The specific importance of E47, a member of a large family of bHLH transcription factors which could potentially interact with the E-pal element of the mouse E-cadherin promoter (31Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), was initially highligthed by its identification in the one-hybrid screen (41 out of 130 clones). Other bHLH factors were not identified in this screen with the exception of a product of the E2-2 gene which represented a much smaller proportion of the isolated clones (to be reported elsewhere). The ability of E47 to interact specifically with the E2-boxes of the E-pal element was confirmed further in band-shift assays carried out both with a recombinant E47 protein and with nuclear extracts of E47-expressing cells. Interestingly, the products of E2A gene are not expressed in epithelial cell lines, whereas they are strongly expressed inE-cadherin-deficient, invasive cell lines. This observation is discrepant with the previous assumption that the E2A gene is expressed ubiquitously (26Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kawamori R. Kamada T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Zhuang Y. Soriano P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 41Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In relation to this, thein situ hybridization analysis in mouse embryos presented here clearly illustrates the absence of E2A gene products in all embryonic epithelia, in contrast to its high expression in the mesoderm of early embryos. The inverse relationship observed betweenE2A and E-cadherin expression in early embryonic development argues in favor of a role for E2A gene products in the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression and thus in the generation and/or maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype. In this context, it is important to consider that the lack of embryonic defects observed in E2A null mice can probably be explained by functional complementation by E2–2 and HEB gene products (39Zhuang Y. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 40Zhuang Y. Barndt R.J. Pan L. Kelley R. Dai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3340-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The involvement of E47 in EMTs and repression of E-cadherinexpression is supported by ectopic expression studies in a prototypic epithelial cell line. Stable expression of E47 in MDCK cells induces a dramatic EMT, characterized by a complete suppression ofE-cadherin expression and an increased expression and reorganization of mesenchymal markers. Significantly, stable expression of E47 also leads to the acquisition of migratory/invasive and tumorigenic properties in MDCK cells. Additionally, in PDV cells, transient expression of E47 from an inducible expression vector causes a reduction in E-cadherin expression (as observed by RT-PCR). These results, together with the inverse correlation between the endogenous E2A andE-cadherin expression in carcinoma cell lines and embryos, support the hypothesis that E12/E47 participate in the repression ofE-cadherin expression. With regard to the specific mechanism leading to the repression of E-cadherin by E2A factor, our studies on the exogenous E-cadherin promoter in MDCK-E47 cells, together with in vitro binding assays and the in vivo yeast system, indicate a direct interaction of E47 with the E2-boxes of the E-pal element of theE-cadherin promoter. Transcriptional regulation byE2A products is usually mediated by specific heterodimers formed by their combination with tissue-specific class II bHLH factors (25Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 28Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 29Lee J.E. Curr. Opin.

Potential partners for E47 could be the mesodermal bHLH factors described in various systems such as Twist (50Wolf C. Thisse C. Stoetzel C. Thisse B. Gerlinger P. Perrin-Schmitt F. Dev. Biol. 1991; 143: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), Meso1 (51Blanar M.A. Crossley P.H. Peters K.G. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Martin G.R. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that E47 homodimers may be functionally active as E-cadherinrepressors because our band-shift assays using the recombinant E47 protein and the in vivo yeast analysis indicate that this factor is able to interact with the E-pal element as an homodimer. Finally, the data presented here do not exclude that repression of theE-cadherin promoter by E12/E47 could also involve the association with additional transcription factors. In this context, it is relevant to mention that zinc finger factors such as Snail (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), some of which have been characterized recently as E-cadherin repressors, also bind to the E-boxes of the E-cadherin promoter. Alternatively, or in addition, the repression mechanism of E12/E47 could also involve its interaction with other coregulators in macromolecular complexes, as has been described in the regulation of achute-scute complex inDrosophila (56Ramain P. Khechumian R. Khechumian K. Arbogast N. Ackermann C. Heitzler P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and in genes involved in hematopoiesis in erythroid cells (47Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In any case, the interaction of E12/E47 with putative specific bHLH partners and/or additional regulators will ultimately depend on the cellular context.Because very recently we and others have demonstrated an important role for the transcription factor Snail in the repression ofE-cadherin expression (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar, 49Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia De Herreros A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar) and in the EMT events that occur at tumor invasion and development (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar), it is pertinent to compare these studies with the present report. Both Snailand E47 are able to trigger EMT upon stable ectopic expression in MDCK cells. However, a closer examination of MDCK-E47 and MDCK-Snail transfectant cells reveals important differences in their behavior. In particular, MDCK-E47 cells exhibited increased migration in wound assays, starting to migrate into the wound much faster than MDCK-Snail cells (see Fig. 3 and Ref. 21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar). In addition, the tumors induced by MCDK-E47 cells show a higher rate of proliferation than those induced by MDCK-Snail cells. These observations suggest that although both factors are capable of triggering EMT and of inducing an invasive and tumorigenic phenotype they may operate in distinct aspects of these processes. Consequently, it will be important to analyze and compare the influence of both factors in other important tumor progression events, such as angiogenesis.With regard to their role in EMT during embryonic development, the comparison of the expression patterns ofSnail and E2A in early mouse embryos shows thatSnail is highly expressed in the regions undergoing EMTs (mainly the precursors of the neural crest cells and the primitive streak) (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar, 44Sefton M. Sanchez S. Nieto M.A. Development. 1998; 125: 3111-3121PubMed Google Scholar), whereas E2A transcripts are detected throughout the mesoderm and the neural tube (Fig. 7). Interestingly,E2A transcripts are detected only at very low levels in regions undergoing EMT such as the neural crest cells delaminating from the neural tube (Fig. 7 f), which show high levels ofSnail expression (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar, 44Sefton M. Sanchez S. Nieto M.A. Development. 1998; 125: 3111-3121PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression pattern of Slug, another member of the Snail family, overlaps with that of E2A (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar, 44Sefton M. Sanchez S. Nieto M.A. Development. 1998; 125: 3111-3121PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned above, Slug binds to the same E-boxes (54Inukai T. Inoue A. Kurosawa H. Goi K. Shinjyo T. Ozawa K. Mao M. Inaba T. Look A.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) as E47 and Snail, making it a more likely candidate to cooperate with E47. Indeed, Slug has been shown to participate in desmosome dissociation in rat bladder epithelial cells (57Savagner P. Yamada K.M. Thiery J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and suggested to cooperate with Snail in the maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype (21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar). Because repression of E-cadherinoccurs in regions undergoing EMTs and it is maintained in the resulting mesenchyme (5Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 21Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar), it could be postulated that Snail andE2A play distinct roles in the repression ofE-cadherin expression in embryonic development.Snail may function by rapidly repressingE-cadherin expression at specific EMT sites, andE2A may then contribute to the maintenance of this repression in the embryonic mesenchyme. It is tempting to speculate that a similar scenario could operate during the invasion process in which the two transcription factors could act in a coordinated or sequential action. Thus, Snail could be responsible for the initial down-regulation of E-cadherin expression at the invasion front while E2A, alone or in cooperation with other repressors, could contribute to the maintenance of E-cadherin repression and the invasive mesenchymal phenotype further away from the invasion front. Further studies addressed to identify additional target genes for Snail and E2A and their putative partners, together with a detailed analysis of their expression patterns in tumor biopsies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.In summary, the results presented in this paper clearly show a novel role for the bHLH transcription factor E12/E47 as a repressor ofE-cadherin expression and as an inducer of EMTs, concomitant with the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. They also reinforce the significance of transcriptional repression as a major mechanism involved in E-cadherin down-regulation. The next challenge will be the identification of specific partners for E12/E47 which may cooperate in the regulation of these important processes both during normal embryonic development and in tumor progression. Invasion of tumor cells into adjacent connective tissues represents the first step of metastasis in carcinomas. The invasion process involves the loss of cell-cell interactions together with the gain of proteolytic and migratory properties and is frequently associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs)1 (1Behrens J.

Developmental and Evolutionary Aspects of Neural Crest. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987: 123-145Google Scholar). Strong cell-cell adhesion is mainly dependent on the E-cadherin/catenin adhesion system in both embryonic and adult epithelial tissues (4Larue L. Ohsugi M. Hirchenhain J. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8263-8267Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 5Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 6Gumbiner B.M.

Indeed, the loss of E-cadherin-mediated intercellular interactions is required for the acquisition of the invasive phenotype in epithelial tumors (8Takeichi M. Curr. Opin.

In certain forms of FAP, the amyloid fibrils are mostly constituted by variants of transthyretin (TTR), a homotetrameric plasma protein. Recently, we showed that transthyretin in solution may undergo dissociation to a non-native monomer, even under close to physiological conditions of temperature, pH, ionic strength, and protein concentration. We also showed that this non-native monomer is a compact structure, does not behave as a molten globule, and may lead to the formation of partially unfolded monomeric species and high molecular mass soluble aggregates (Quintas, A., Saraiva, M. J. M., and Brito, R. M. M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 32943–32949). Here, based on aging experiments of tetrameric TTR and chemically induced protein unfolding experiments of the non-native monomeric forms, we show that tetramer dissociation and partial unfolding of the monomer precedes amyloid fibril formation. We also show that TTR variants with the least thermodynamically stable non-native monomer produce the largest amount of partially unfolded monomeric species and soluble aggregates under conditions that are close to physiological. Additionally, the soluble aggregates formed by the amyloidogenic TTR variants showed morphological and thioflavin-T fluorescence properties characteristic of amyloid. These results allowed us to conclude that amyloid fibril formation by some TTR variants might be triggered by tetramer dissociation to a compact non-native monomer with low conformational stability, which originates partially unfolded monomeric species with a high tendency for ordered aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Thus, partial unfolding and conformational fluctuations of molecular species with marginal thermodynamic stability may play a crucial role on amyloid formationin vivo.

Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 2Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 9: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). However, only some proteins seem to form amyloid in vivo. Transthyretin (TTR) is such a protein and has been implicated in pathologies such as senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), which are characterized by systemic extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils, mostly constituted by TTR or its variants (3Saraiva M.J.M. Birken S. Costa P.P. Goodman D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 104-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Saraiva M.J.M. J. Peripheral Nervous System. 1996; 1: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar). While SSA is generally a mild disorder and predominantly affects individuals over 80 years of age, FAP is an autosomal dominant lethal disease and may affect individuals from their twenties. In SSA, intact normal TTR and its fragments constitute the amyloid fibrils. In FAP, the amyloid fibrils are mostly constituted by variants of TTR. More than 80 TTR mutations have been reported, many of them amyloidogenic (5Connors L.H Richardson A.M. Theberge R. Costello C.E. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). One of the most common amyloidogenic TTR variants is V30M-TTR, and L55P-TTR is the variant associated with one of the most aggressive forms of FAP. TTR is a homotetrameric protein with a total molecular mass of 55 kDa, 127 amino acid residues per subunit, and a high percentage of β-sheet. TTR is synthesized mainly in the liver, choroid plexus, and retina (6Soprano D.R. Herbert J. Soprano K.J. Schon E.A. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 25: 11793-11798Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 7Stauder A.J. Dickson P.W. Aldred A.R. Schreiber G. Mendelsohn F.A. Hudson P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, amyloid deposits in FAP occur extracellularly mostly in the peripheral nerves but also in the heart, kidneys, vitreous, and other organs. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to elucidate the pathways of synthesis, folding, and trafficking of TTR in order to select the proper therapeutic approaches. To date, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the role of a low pH environment, for example found in the lysosomes, in determining the conditions for amyloid formation by TTR in vivo (8Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). However, we recently showed that the TTR tetramer dissociates to a non-native monomer at pH 7 and near physiological ionic strengths and that monomeric species may self-assemble into high molecular mass aggregates (9Quintas A.L. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This allowed us to propose a model for amyloidogenesis by TTR under commonly observed physiological conditions and, thus, consistent with extracellular amyloid deposit formation (10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here we show, based on aging experiments and thermodynamic stability measurements at pH 7.0 that there is a clear correlation between the stability of the non-native monomer formed upon tetramer dissociation, aggregate formation, and the amyloidogenic potential of four different TTR variants: WT-, V30M-, L55P-, and T119M-TTR. We also show that tetramer dissociation and monomer partial unfolding seem to precede amyloid protofibril formation. Thus, partial unfolding and conformational fluctuations of marginally stable TTR non-native monomers play a key role in the molecular events leading to amyloid fibril assembly. Guanidinium chloride, thioflavin-T, and all other chemicals were of the highest commercially available purity and were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO. Recombinant WT-, V30M-, L55P-, and T119M-transthyretin were produced in an Escherichia coliexpression system (11Furuya H. Saraiva M.J.M. Gawinowicz M.A. Alves I.L. Costa P.P. Sasaki H. Goto I. Sakaki Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (12Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brouwer A. Saraiva M.J.M. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Tetrameric and monomeric forms of all TTR variants were isolated by gel filtration chromatography (10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometricaly at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 7.76 × 104m−1cm−1, based on a 55 kDa molecular mass for TTR (A 280(1%) = 14.1 mg−1 ml cm−1) (13Raz A Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3230-3237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When needed, TTR samples were reconcentrated by ultrafiltration on a Centricon-3 microconcentrator (from Amicon Inc.) with a molecular mass cutoff of 3 kDa. Aging studies of tetrameric TTR variants were performed incubating for up to 4 weeks TTR samples at 37 °C in chromatography buffer with 0.05% sodium azide in order to prevent microbial growth. Samples were withdrawn at different times for analysis by gel filtration chromatography and further processing. Gel filtration chromatography experiments were performed on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC Superdex-75 HR column, coupled to a high precision pump P-500, a UV detector equipped with a deuterium lamp, and an integrator from Konik Instruments. The column was allowed to equilibrate with 3–5 column volumes of chromatography buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0). Final chromatography runs were performed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Apparent molecular masses were calculated by interpolation on an elution volume versus log(molecular mass) calibration curve for four protein standards: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Thioflavin-T assays (14Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) were performed adding a freshly prepared stock solution of thioflavin-T in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0, to the TTR samples under study to a final thioflavin-T concentration of 10 µm. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cell compartment at 25 °C and using a 1.0 × 0.4 cm pathlength fluorescence cuvette. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and excitation and emission slits of 1 and 1.5 mm, respectively. Synthetic amyloid fibrils were produced by lowering the pH of a 2 µm solution of L55P-TTR to pH 5.0 and incubating at room temperature for 1 week. High molecular mass soluble aggregates of L55P-TTR were isolated by gel filtration chromatography at a final concentration of ∼20 µg/ml. For negative staining, 5 µl of these preparations were adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon collodion film on 200-square mesh copper grids for 1 min. The grids were washed with deionized water and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate (Polysciences, Inc). Specimens were viewed and images recorded with a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Native tetrameric forms of TTR dissociate to a non-native monomeric species, as previously described (10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of these non-native monomeric forms of WT-, V30M-, L55P-, and T119M-TTR variants was measured in GdnHCl-induced protein unfolding experiments at 25.0 °C and followed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence changes. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cell compartment at 25 °C and using a 1.0 × 0.2 cm pathlength fluorescence cuvette. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and excitation and emission slits of 1.5 and 2 mm, respectively. Due to the difficulty in isolating and concentrating the non-native monomeric species, unfolding experiments were carried out by titrating monomeric TTR samples (∼2 µm) in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm sodium chloride at pH 7 and 25 °C, with a 8 m GdnHCl stock solution prepared in the same buffer. After each addition of GdnHCl, several fluorescence measurements were performed in order to evaluate when the solutions reached the equilibrium. It was found that a 0.5-h incubation was enough to reach equilibrium for all GdnHCl concentrations. However, all the samples were allowed to equilibrate 1.5 h before the final fluorescence measurements. All fluorescence measurements were corrected for protein dilution produced during the titration. Equilibrium denaturation curves were constructed using the intensity of fluorescence emission at 380 nm, with excitation at 280 nm. Excitation at 295 nm, to excite just tryptophan residues, produced curves of lower intensity but no significantly different shape. Denaturation curves were analyzed according to a two-state unfolding model and using the linear extrapolation method (15Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) in a non-linear least squares fitting procedure (16Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Non-linear least squares fitting of the experimental fluorescence data was performed with the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Pennsylvania) and yielded values for ΔG°(H2O), the conformational stability, andm, the dependence of ΔG° on denaturant concentration. Cm, the denaturant concentration at the midpoint of the unfolding transition was calculated as Cm = ΔG°(H2O)/m. We have previously shown that the transthyretin tetramer in solution dissociates to a non-native monomer at nearly physiological conditions (9Quintas A.L. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the extent of tetramer dissociation is not very different among the TTR variants studied (WT-, V30M-, L55P-, and T119M-TTR) after a 24-h incubation, at 25 °C (9Quintas A.L. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, based on aging experiments of the native tetrameric forms of several TTR variants at pH 7.0 and 37 °C and stability measurements of the non-native monomeric forms of these TTR variants, we put forward additional hypothesis for the mechanisms of amyloid formation by TTR. Fig. 1shows gel filtration elution profiles of the tetrameric forms of WT-, V30M-, L55P- and T119M-TTR, as a function of incubation time at 37 °C and pH 7.0 after initial tetramer isolation. Several molecular species can be identified in the chromatograms. The major species correspond to the tetramer, with an elution volume of 8.8 ml and an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa. Depending on the incubation time at 37 °C and the TTR variant under analysis, a complex mixture of molecular species is observed with elution volumes around 20 ml, corresponding to a non-native monomer (elution volume = 15.2 ml) and several partially unfolded monomeric species, as was previously shown by fluorescence and ANS-binding (10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In fact, the tetramer initially dissociates to small amounts of the non-native monomer, which then interconverts to the partially unfolded monomeric species. Additionally, in some chromatograms of the more amyloidogenic TTR variants (V30M- and L55P-TTR, Fig. 1, B and C), species with elution volumes around 6.5 ml and apparent molecular masses higher than 70 kDa, the resolving limit of the column, are observed. Fig. 1 clearly shows two distinct patterns for TTR tetramer aging, one pattern for WT- and T119M-TTR and another for V30M- and L55P-TTR. For amyloidogenic TTR variants (V30M- and L55P-TTR, Fig. 1, Band C, respectively) there is an initial dissociation of the tetramer to the non-native monomer within the first 24 h. This is followed by interconversion to several partially unfolded monomeric species with elution volumes around 20 ml and finally formation of high molecular mass soluble aggregates with elution volumes around 6.5 ml. The amount and variety of partially unfolded monomeric species and aggregates formed correlates with the amyloidogenic potential of the TTR variant (Fig. 1, B and C). In fact, the presence of partially unfolded monomeric species and aggregates in L55P-TTR occurs at an earlier stage and to a larger extent (Fig.1 C) than in V30M-TTR (Fig. 1 B). On the contrary, for WT-TTR (Fig. 1 A) and the non-amyloidogenic variant T119M-TTR (Fig. 1 D) aggregate formation is not evident up to 360 h at 37 °C and at the physiologically relevant TTR concentrations used. Additionally, the amount of partially unfolded monomeric species is much lower in these proteins, and they appear later in the aging process when compared with the amyloidogenic variants. In fact, for T119M-TTR partially unfolded monomeric species are almost non-observable. From the analysis of Fig. 1, it is also evident that formation of high molecular mass aggregates is preceded by formation of partially unfolded monomeric species. During the course of the aging experiments we have also monitored the relative amount of tetrameric species in solution. Fig.2 shows the disappearance of tetrameric species in solution, monitored by gel filtration chromatography for several TTR variants when incubated at 37 °C and pH 7.0 for up to 670 h. WT- and T119M-TTR show only a very slight decrease in the relative amount of tetramer in solution over this period of time. On the contrary, V30M- and L55P-TTR show a significant decrease in the relative amount of tetramer in solution. This decrease is much more significant for L55P-TTR, the variant that produces the most aggressive form of amyloidosis in vivo. These data for the decrease of tetramer in solution at 37 °C and pH 7.0 directly correlates with the appearance of several monomeric species and aggregates in solution, as shown in Fig. 1. It is interesting to note that the time course for the disappearance of tetramer among the soluble species and the simultaneous appearance of monomeric and aggregate species in solution correlates with the amyloidogenic potential of the TTR variants studied. These data suggest that the source of amyloidogenic intermediates is the dissociation of tetrameric TTR to a non-native monomer and that this process might be kinetically controlled. To address the importance of the non-native TTR monomer in the formation of partially unfolded monomeric species and aggregates, we have characterized the conformational stability of the non-native monomer for WT-, V30M-, L55P-, and T119M-TTR. Fig.3 shows the equilibrium denaturation curves at pH 7.0 and 25 °C using guanidinium chloride as denaturant. The free energy of unfolding (ΔG°(H2O)) was directly obtained by a nonlinear least-squares fit of the experimental fluorescence data to a two-state model for monomer unfolding (15Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 16Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). GdnHCl-induced denaturation of the non-native monomer was found to be reversible for all the variants studied, as judged by gel filtration chromatography and fluorescence experiments. Application of GdnHCl-unfolded monomeric TTR samples to the gel filtration column produced a chromatographic species with the same elution volume and fluorescence properties of the non-native monomer. Table I shows the values obtained from the curves in Fig. 3 for ΔG°(H2O), the conformational stability, m, the dependence of ΔG° on denaturant concentration, and Cm, the denaturant concentration at the midpoint of the unfolding transition. The lower ΔG°(H2O) values obtained for the amyloidogenic variants indicate a decrease in the conformational stability of the non-native monomer in these variants, when compared with the non-native monomer of WT-TTR (Table I). Additionally, the conformational stability of the T119M-TTR non-native monomer is significantly higher than that of the wild type. The decreasing values of the conformational stability of the non-native monomers studied (T119M-TTR > WT-TTR > V30M-TTR > L55P-TTR) completely agree with the increasing amyloidogenic potential of these TTR variants (T119M-TTR < WT-TTR < V30M-TTR < L55P-TTR). Moreover, the denaturation midpoint, Cm, also shows this dependence, i.e.the variants showing the lower Cm value are those with highest amyloidogenic potential (Table I). It is worth noting that the significantly higher conformational stability shown by the T119M-TTR non-native monomer is mostly due to a higher mvalue for this monomer (Table I). The m value is believed to reflect the extent of newly exposed surface area upon unfolding (17Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Thus, the higher m value observed for the unfolding of T119M-TTR non-native monomer might indicate a more compact structure in this monomer.Table IStability parameters for non-native monomers of several TTR variants obtained from a direct fit of the experimental data in Fig. 3 to a two state unfolding model (16Santoro M.M.

Open table in a new tab The results on conformational stability of the non-native monomers explain the observations obtained in the aging experiments shown in Fig. 1. The number and amount of partially unfolded monomeric species observed in solution for the four studied TTR variants seems to be directly related with the conformational stability of the non-native monomers. TTR variants with less stable non-native monomers produce the largest amount and variety of partially unfolded monomeric species in the aging experiment. In order to characterize the nature of the high molecular mass soluble aggregates formed in the aging experiment (Fig.1) we carried out thioflavin-T assays (14Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) in soluble aggregates, isolated by gel exclusion chromatography, and amyloid fibrils of L55P-TTR (Fig. 4). Thioflavin-T is known to undergo a red shift of its fluorescence excitation and emission maxima upon binding to amyloid fibrils. In the absence of amyloid fibrils thioflavin-T has a low fluorescence quantum yield with excitation and emission maxima at 350 and 438 nm, respectively. In the presence of amyloid fibrils the fluorescence quantum yield increases significantly and the excitation and emission maxima are shifted to 450 and 482 nm, respectively (14Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the response of thioflavin-T in the presence of L55P-TTR high molecular mass soluble aggregates, isolated by gel filtration chromatography, and in the presence of L55P-TTR fibrils as a control prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At the excitation wavelength used (450 nm), thioflavin-T does not show any significant fluorescence in phosphate buffer, at pH 7.0. However, in the presence of L55P-TTR high molecular mass soluble aggregates, fluorescence is observed with an emission maximum of 482 nm, exactly the same emission maximum observed in the presence of L55P-TTR fibrils used as a control. This result clearly shows that the nature of the molecular interaction between thioflavin-T and the L55P-TTR soluble aggregates is similar to the one occurring between thioflavin-T and TTR fibrils (Fig. 4) or thioflavin-T and amyloid fibrils of other origins. We note, however, that the absolute fluorescence intensity enhancement, per mass of protein, observed in the presence of L55P-TTR soluble aggregates is smaller than in the presence of TTR fibrils (data not shown). This may be the result of the smaller size of the soluble aggregates when compared with the mature fibrils. To further characterize the nature of the soluble aggregates, we studied the morphology of the L55P-TTR high molecular mass soluble aggregates by electron microscopy (EM). The electron micrographs (Fig.5) revealed short unbranched fibrillar structures with 8–9 nm diameter and variable length ranging from 25 to 75 nm. The diameter of these fibrillar structures is similar to the diameter observed by EM of amyloid fibrils isolated from the kidneys of patients with V30M-TTR FAP (18Tawara S. Araki S. Toshimori K. Nakagawa H. Ohtaki S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 98: 811-822PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, mature amyloid fibrils vary widely in length. This might indicate that the mature TTR fibrils are formed by end-growth or by end-to-end association of initial short protofibrils of similar width as the final fibrils. Taken together, the results from electron microscopy and thioflavin-T assays clearly indicate that the TTR soluble aggregates, readily formed by amyloidogenic TTR variants at pH 7.0, represent an initial stage of amyloid fibril assembly. In recent years, the molecular mechanisms of amyloid formation have been the focus of wide attention due to their implication in several human and animal pathologies. Recently, we showed that transthyretin, the homotetrameric protein responsible for pathologies such as SSA and FAP, may dissociate in solution to a non-native monomer even under close to physiological conditions of temperature, pH, ionic strength, and protein concentration. We also showed that this non-native monomer is a compact structure, does not behave as a molten globule, and may lead to the formation of partially unfolded monomeric species and high molecular mass soluble aggregates (10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here, based on aging studies of the tetrameric forms as well as on thermodynamic stability studies of the monomeric forms of amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic TTR variants, we show that TTR variants with the least thermodynamically stable non-native monomer produce the largest number and amount of partially unfolded monomeric species and soluble aggregates (Fig. 1 and Table I). Additionally, the soluble aggregates formed by the amyloidogenic TTR variants show morphological and thioflavin-T fluorescence properties characteristic of amyloid (Figs. 4and 5). In particular, the observed diameter of the aggregates (8–9 nm) is very close to what has been previously observed for mature V30M-TTR ex-vivo fibrils (18Tawara S. Araki S. Toshimori K. Nakagawa H. Ohtaki S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 98: 811-822PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the soluble aggregates isolated in the aging experiments represent an early stage of amyloid fibril formation, i.e. protofibrils. Therefore, TTR amyloid fibril assembly may proceed initially by end-elongation of small protofibrils followed by end-association of these protofibrils, a mechanism similar to what has been proposed for the assembly of Aβ40 amyloid fibrils (19Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 20Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of WT-, V30M-, L55P-, and T119M-TTR that the tetrameric forms of these variants are highly stable to thermal unfolding (21Shnyrov V.L. Villar E. Zhadan G.G. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 88: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additionally, the observed small differences in conformational stability do not agree with the relative amyloidogenic potential of the TTR variants studied (21Shnyrov V.L. Villar E. Zhadan G.G. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 88: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the conformational stability of tetrameric TTR do not seem to justify the amyloidogenic character of some TTR variants. The aging and stability data presented here points out new clues on the mechanisms of amyloid formation by TTR and allowed us to refine our previously proposed model for amyloid fibril formation by TTR (10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). At pH 7 and 37 °C the TTR tetramer may dissociate to a non-native monomer (Fig. 6). Depending on its conformational stability, the non-native monomer may undergo partial unfolding, which leads to the formation of aggregates with amyloid character and eventually amyloid fibrils (Fig. 6). Previously, we considered the possible existence of a complex equilibrium between the non-native monomer, partially unfolded monomeric species, and soluble aggregates (10Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here identifies the partially unfolded monomeric species as the probable source of aggregate formation. The aging experiments show the appearance of partially unfolded monomeric species preceding the formation of amyloid aggregates. Additionally, comparison of the stability data for the non-native monomers of the four TTR variants studied shows that the variants with the unfolding equilibrium most shifted away from the non-native monomer produce the largest amount of aggregates. This clearly indicates that at least some of the partially unfolded monomeric species are intermediates in the pathway leading to amyloid fibril formation. In fact, if the amyloid aggregates were formed directly from the non-native monomer we would expect that higher conformational stabilities of the non-native monomer would produce larger amounts of aggregates, which is not what we observe. Our model also allows for discrimination between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic behavior. In both cases, non-native monomers are formed upon tetramer dissociation. However, while highly amyloidogenic TTR variants produce large amounts of partially unfolded monomeric species and aggregates, non-amyloidogenic variants do not (Fig. 6). Thus, the different in vivo behavior between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic TTR variants may be mostly mediated by the conformational stability of the non-native monomers formed upon tetramer dissociation. In fact, the higher m value we obtained in the conformational stability studies of the non-native monomer of T119M-TTR, a non-amyloidogenic variant, may indicate a better structured and more compact monomer in this case. It is also important to remember that due to the logarithmic dependence of ΔG° on the equilibrium constant, the apparent small differences in conformational stability observed between non-native monomers of TTR variants are translated into significant differences in the equilibrium constants for unfolding. For example at 25 °C, while for the WT-TTR non-native monomer ∼320 molecules are unfolded per 100,000 molecules, in L55P-TTR as much as 1500 molecules are unfolded per 100,000 molecules and in T119M-TTR only 6 molecules are unfolded per 100,000 molecules. This reveals that a low conformational stability of the non-native monomer produced from tetramer dissociation may be the molecular key for amyloidogenesis by TTR. Recent studies also revealed correlations of this type between the amyloidogenic potential and the conformational stability of variants of immunoglobulin light-chain variable domains (22Rafen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschil C. Pokkuluri P.R. Dave P. Stevens P., W. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the conformational stability of variants of the B1 Ig-binding domain of protein G (23Ramirez-Alvarado M. Merkel J.S. Regan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the more amyloidogenic TTR variants produce a larger number and amount of partially unfolded monomeric species. The presence of a critical amount of these less structured species in solution seems to trigger the formation of TTR soluble aggregates with amyloid character. Thus, partially unfolded monomeric species seem to be the building blocks of the soluble aggregates, protofibrils, and eventually amyloid fibrils. In fact, Kirschner and co-workers (24Inouye H. Domingues F.S. Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J. Lundgren E. Sandgren O. Kirschener D.A. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), based on x-ray fiber diffraction studies on biopsy samples of kidney and vitreous human TTR amyloid fibrils, proposed a fibril structure composed of four protofilaments of axially arrayed TTR monomers. Additionally, the crystal structure of L55P-TTR showed a tubular structure formed by association of TTR monomers (25Sebastião M.P. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24715-24722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In a recent study, using constructed mutants, it was shown that dimers resulting from disulfide-linked monomers could not form amyloid in vitro but under reducing conditions readily formed thioflavin-T positive fibrils (26Redondo C. Damas A.M. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Saraiva M.J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data suggest the formation of amyloid fibrils from monomeric species, which supports our model (Fig. 6). Upon aggregation the TTR partially unfolded monomeric species may reacquire structure stabilized by intermolecular interactions. Observations agreeing with this possibility were reported in a study with staphylococcal nuclease, which showed that the amount of secondary structure in a monomeric partially folded intermediate doubled upon formation of soluble aggregates and the propensity to aggregate decreased with increasing structural content of the partially folded intermediate (27Uversky V.N. Segel D.J. Doniach S. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5480-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Considering the results presented here, we propose that amyloid formation by TTR is triggered by tetramer dissociation to a compact non-native monomer, which, depending on its thermodynamic stability, originates less structured monomeric species with a high tendency for ordered aggregation into amyloid fibrils through specific intermolecular contacts. Therefore, the amyloidogenic potential of some TTR variants could be related to higher tendencies to produce partially unfolded monomeric species, which reacquire β-sheet structure upon aggregation, forming the characteristic cross-β structure of amyloid fibrils. Thus, partial unfolding and conformational fluctuations of molecular species with marginal thermodynamic stability may play a crucial role in amyloid formation in vivo.

The multiple functions of Rho are mediated through the tightly regulated GTP-binding/GTPase cycle (14Hall A. Science. 1998; 280: 2074-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Sah V.P.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Three different classes of proteins are required for this regulation: (i) guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 which stimulate the GTP-GDP exchange reaction; (ii) GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate the GTP-hydrolytic reaction; and (iii) guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which by binding to Rho block the dissociation of GDP from Rho GTPases (17Geyer M. Wittinghofer A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GDI is also capable of inhibiting GTP hydrolysis by Rho family GTPases as well as stimulating the release of Rho-GTPases from cellular membranes, thereby shutting off the Rho cycle (18Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, GDI plays a critical role in the signaling events regulated by Rho-GTPases (19Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The GDP-bound form of Rho complexed with GDI is not activated by Rho-GEFs, suggesting that Rho activation critically depends upon upstream factors mediating the dissociation of GDI from Rho (19Olofsson B.

It has been suggested that the dissociation of Rho-GDI might be facilitated by members of ezrin/radixin/moesin family of proteins (22Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, Rho-GDI was found to interact only with the N-terminal fragment of radixin but not the full-length radixin, indicating the need of upstream effectors that are required to induce the unfolding of radixin (23Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies indicate that the translocation and activation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins to the membrane are critically dependent on Rho, thereby indicating the intervention of other molecules that activate dissociation of GDI from Rho (24Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 25Kotani H. Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1705-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Rho-GDI is a family consisting of Rho-GDI-1, Ly/D4-GDI, and Rho GDI-III. Of these, Rho-GDI is ubiquitously expressed (19Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 22Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The structure of Rho-GDI-1 indicates that it contains sequences for phosphorylation by serine-threonine kinases, raising the possibility that Rho-GDI is regulated by signaling mechanisms that induce its phosphorylation. Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes are serine-threonine kinases that induce phosphorylation of multiple proteins, which in turn regulate intracellular signaling (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). A PKC-dependent pathway is important in the mechanism of thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability (3Lum H.

Because of the possibility that PKC may activate Rho by mediating Rho-GDI phosphorylation, we investigated the role of PKC in the mechanism of thrombin-induced Rho activation and in signaling the loss of endothelial barrier function in human umbilical venular endothelial (HUVE) cells. The present findings suggest the existence of a novel pathway by which thrombin can stimulate Rho activation. This pathway involves PKC-α-mediated phosphorylation of GDI, which may stimulate GDI dissociation, thereby resulting in Rho activation and increased endothelial permeability. Human α-thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). HUVE cells and endothelial growth medium (EBM-2) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-Rho-A, anti-Rho-GDI, and anti-PKC-α, -ε, -δ, and -ζ polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Purified GST-Rho-GDI was purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). HUVE cells were cultured in a T-75 flask coated with 0.1% gelatin in EBM-2 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air until they formed a confluent monolayer. Cells from each of the primary flasks were detached with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA and resuspended in fresh culture medium and passaged as described below. In all experiments, unless otherwise indicated, a confluent monolayer of HUVE cells was washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated in serum-free medium for 3–4 h before treatment with the drug. In all experiments, cells between passages 4 and 8 were used. The time course of endothelial cell retraction, a measure of increased endothelial permeability, was measured according to the procedures described previously (31Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). HUVE cells grown to confluence on a gelatin-coated small gold electrode (4.9 × 10−4cm2) were pretreated with 500 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) overnight or with 10 μg/ml of C3 transferase for 16 h in EBM-10% fetal bovine serum medium. After serum deprivation, cells were stimulated with thrombin to measure change in electrical resistance of the endothelial monolayer. The small electrode and larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was supplied by a 1-V 4000-Hz alternating current connected serially to a 1-megohm resistor between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode. The voltage between the small and large electrode was monitored by a lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed on a computer. Data are presented as change in resistive (in phase) portion of impedance normalized to its initial value at time zero. pGEX-2T containing rhotekin-Rho binding domain was provided by Dr. M. A. Schwartz (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Bacterial-expressed GST-rhotekin-Rho binding domain (RBD) protein was purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranozide (1 mm)-induced DH5α cells previously transformed with the appropriate plasmid as described previously (32Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Confluent HUVE cells grown in 100-mm dishes were stimulated for the indicated times with 50 nm thrombin or 100 nm PMA. Cells were then quickly washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min, and equal volumes of cell lysates were incubated with GST-RBD beads (15 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 3 times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.1 mm PMSF), and bound Rho was eluted by boiling each sample in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted samples from beads and total cell lysate were then electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-Rho-A antibody. The amount of RBD-bound Rho was normalized to the total amount of Rho in cell lysates for quantitation of Rho activity in different samples using scanning densitometry. A serum-starved confluent monolayer of HUVE cells was labeled with 300 μCi/ml 32P for 4 h in phosphate-free medium, after which they were stimulated with 50 nm thrombin or 100 nm PMA at indicated times. Cells were quickly rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed for 20 min on ice with 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton-X, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin). After clearing the lysate by centrifuging at 4 °C at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the lysate was incubated with anti-rabbit polyclonal Rho-GDI antibody for 1 h followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed 4 times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, electrophoresed on 4–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose for visualization of GDI phosphorylation by autoradiography and for Western blotting with Rho-GDI antibody to verify equal protein loading. Specificity of the Rho-GDI antibody was confirmed by using peptide immunogen as a negative control. Rho has been shown to be required primarily for agonist-induced SRE reporter gene activity (33Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined using the SRE reporter gene activity, the role of PKC isozymes in the mechanism of Rho activation. The pSRE-luciferase plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kozasa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). C3 transferase, produced by Clostridium botulinum that specifically ADP-ribosylates and inhibits Rho protein (34Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), was purified from an Escherichia colipGEX-2r-bcr recombinant vector expression system as described previously (35Morii N. Narumiya S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The expression vector pcDNA3-containing tagged dominant-negative form of PKC-α and PKC-δ isozymes were provided by Dr. I. B. Weinstein (Columbia University, New York, NY). The dominant-negative PKC-α, PKC-ε, and PKC-δ mutants lacking a functional catalytic domain were generated by a substitution of lysine 368, 437, or 376 for arginine, respectively (36Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with DEAE-dextran method (37Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C906-C914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μg of DNA were mixed with 50 μg/ml DEAE-dextran in serum-free EBM medium, and the mixture was added onto 70–80% confluent cells. pTKRLUC plasmid (0.125 μg) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) containing Renilla luciferase gene driven by the constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter was added to normalize the transfection efficiencies. After 1 h, cells were incubated for 4 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in serum-free medium, washed twice with EBM-containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and grown to confluence. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). SRE-luciferase activity was expressed as the ratio of firefly andRenilla luciferase activity. Cell viability (>95%) after transfection was confirmed using trypan blue (Sigma) exclusion assay. Phosphorylation of Rho-GDI in vitro was performed using immunocomplexes of PKC-α or PKC-ε obtained after immunoprecipitation of cell lysate with respective PKC antibodies as described previously (38Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Confluent cells grown in 100-mm dishes were stimulated for 1 min with 50 nm thrombin, washed quickly with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton-X, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The lysate was scraped and cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. Cell lysate containing an equal amount of protein was then incubated with anti-rabbit polyclonal PKC-α or PKC-ε antibody for 1 h followed by an addition of protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads from each sample were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold lysate buffer, then washed 3 times with PBS, and once with PKC kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg of phosphatidylserine/reaction). The purified GST-Rho-GDI fusion proteins (3 μg) were incubated with immunocomplexes of PKC dissolved in kinase assay buffer for 10 min at 30 °C followed by an addition of cold ATP (20 μm) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, after which the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and each sample was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to x-ray films. The blots were then subjected to Western blotting with anti-PKC-α or PKC-ε antibodies to verify the equal amount of the protein in each reaction. Comparisons among experimental groups were made by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance using SigmaStat software. Differences in mean values were considered significant at p < 0.05. We used GST-rhotekin fusion protein, which specifically binds to activated Rho, to quantitate Rho activation (32Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 39van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Delft S. Vermeer M.A. Collard J.G. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 335-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin induced a 3–4-fold increase in Rho activity in a time-dependent manner with a maximum response occurring at 1 min followed by a decline at 10 min (Fig. 1, A and B). We also used PMA, a direct activator of PKC, to determine the role of PKC activation in mediating Rho activation. As shown in Fig. 1,C and D, PMA induced a 2–3-fold increase in Rho activity in a time-dependent manner with maximum activation at 10 min. To investigate whether PKC acts upstream of Rho activation, we used chelerythrine chloride, a specific (but not isozyme-selective) PKC inhibitor belonging to a new class of PKC inhibitors that interfere with the phosphate acceptor site and non-competitively inhibit the ATP binding site (40Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 41Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Chelerythrine pretreatment of HUVE cells prevented thrombin-induced Rho activation, indicating that PKC is an upstream regulator of Rho activation (Fig.2). To determine whether PKC isozymes involved in thrombin-induced Rho activation were phorbol-sensitive, we studied the effects of PKC depletion by PMA on thrombin-induced Rho activation. HUVE cells were pretreated without or with 500 nm PMA overnight, after which they were stimulated with thrombin to measure Rho activation. Fig. 3 A shows that overnight pretreatment of HUVE cells with PMA prevented Rho activation in response to thrombin. Western blot analysis of the cell lysate from these samples showed that exposure of HUVE cells to phorbol esters resulted in the depletion of PKC-α, PKC-ε, and PKC-δ with PKC-α and PKC-ε being most sensitive to phorbol esters, whereas residual levels of PKC-δ remained detectable. In contrast phorbol ester treatment had no effect on PKC-ζ (Fig. 3 B). Thus, these results indicate that thrombin-induced Rho activation in HUVE cells is regulated by phorbol-sensitive PKC isozymes but not by the atypical PKC isozymes. Using LY379196 and rottlerin, which inhibit PKC-β and PKC-δ isozymes, respectively (42Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Gonzalez C.M. Heath W.F. McDonald J.H. Neel D.A. Rito C.J. Singh U. Stramm L.E.

As these data and the results in Fig. 2 pointed to the phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isozymes, such as PKC-α, as being responsible for thrombin-induced Rho activation, we studied the specific role of PKC-α in the mechanism of thrombin-induced Rho activation. Using the SRE reporter gene activity, we determined the role of PKC isozymes in the mechanism of Rho activation. We used the dominant-negative mutant of PKC-α to address its role in thrombin-induced Rho activation. The dominant-negative mutants of PKC-δ and PKC-ε were also included in these experiments. In addition, we studied the effect of C3 transferase, which inhibits Rho activation (34Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), on thrombin-induced SRE activation. HUVE cells were cotransfected with SRE-luciferase reporter gene construct together without or with C3 transferase and assayed for thrombin-induced SRE luciferase activity. Thrombin increased SRE reporter gene activity by 4-fold, whereas it failed to increase SRE activation in HUVE cells that were cotransfected with C3 transferase. These results indicate that thrombin-induced SRE reporter gene activation is mediated by Rho (Fig.4 A). The results of thrombin-induced SRE reporter gene activity in cells cotransfected with SRE-luciferase reporter without or with dominant-negative mutants of PKC-α, PKC-δ, or PKC-ε are shown in Fig. 4 B. Thrombin-induced SRE reporter gene activity was completely prevented in cells transfected with the dominant-negative mutant of PKC-α. In contrast, dominant-negative PKC-δ or PKC-ε had no significant effect on thrombin-induced SRE activation. Thus, these results, which show that PKC-α is critical in stimulating Rho activation, are in accord with the above findings, which were obtained using pharmacological inhibitors. To determine whether thrombin-induced regulation of Rho by PKC-α occurs as a result of their physical interaction, lysates from cells stimulated without or with thrombin (1-min challenge period) were incubated with GST-rhotekin fusion protein to pull down activated Rho, after which they were subjected to Western blotting with anti-Rho, PKC-α, or PKC-ε antibody. Fig. 5shows that thrombin induced the rapid association of PKC-α and Rho, whereas under similar conditions, Rho and PKC-ε did not associate. The GDP-bound form of Rho complexed with GDI is not activated by Rho-GEFs (19Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rho activation critically depends on upstream factors that activate the dissociation of GDI. Since Rho-GDI contains sequence for phosphorylation, we addressed the possibility that the activation of HUVE cells results in the phosphorylation of GDI. Fig. 6 shows the autoradiograph of GDI phosphorylation in 32P-labeled HUVE cells in response to thrombin or PMA stimulation. Thrombin as well as PMA induced the rapid phosphorylation of GDI that returned to near basal level at 5 min after challenge (Fig. 6). Since thrombin-induced Rho activation was blocked by either PKC depletion of cells or by the inhibition of PKC using chelerythrine, we determined the role of PKC in mediating the phosphorylation of GDI in response to thrombin. Fig.7 shows the role of PKC in mediating thrombin-induced GDI phosphorylation. We found that depletion of PKC by overnight pretreatment with PMA abrogated thrombin-induced phosphorylation of Rho-GDI. Similarly, the inhibition of PKC by chelerythrine pretreatment prevented the phosphorylation of GDI in response to thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells. Thus, these results demonstrate that phorbol-sensitive PKC isozymes are involved in regulating the phosphorylation of GDI in response to thrombin. As Rho activation was regulated by PKC-α, we next performed an immunocomplex protein kinase assay to determine whether PKC-α can directly phosphorylate GDI in vitro. HUVE cells were stimulated without or with thrombin, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKC-α antibody. These immunocomplexes were used for kinase assay using GST-GDI as a substrate. In parallel, control kinase reactions were performed using immunocomplexes obtained from cells immunoprecipitated using anti-PKC-ε antibody. As shown in Fig.8, GST-GDI was slightly phosphorylated by PKC-α in unstimulated cells, but GDI phosphorylation increased markedly in the kinase reaction in cells treated with thrombin. In contrast, PKC-ε failed to induce the phosphorylation of GST-GDI in kinase reaction regardless of whether the immunocomplex was obtained from stimulated or unstimulated cells. The amounts of PKC-α or PKC-ε in each reaction were equivalent (Fig. 8). Thus, these results indicate that activated PKC-α is directly capable of phosphorylating Rho-GDI in vitro. The biochemical events by which PKC activation regulates thrombin-induced barrier dysfunction are incompletely understood (3Lum H. Malik A.B. Am. J.

Because the results of this study directly implicate PKC as the upstream regulator of Rho, we measured changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (the basis of increased paracellular endothelial permeability) in PKC-depleted cells or in cells treated with C3 transferase to block Rho activation. As shown in Fig. 9, thrombin caused a significant decrease in resistance in untreated cells, whereas the decreases in resistance in response to thrombin were significantly reduced in cells, which were depleted of phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isozymes, as well as in cells treated with C3 transferase. Rho activation plays an important role in the mechanism of increased transendothelial permeability induced by mediators such as thrombin (11Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. Schaphorst K. Siddiqui R.

The dissociation of GDI from Rho-GDP complex is a prerequisite for the activation of Rho by Rho-GEF (19Olofsson B. Cell.

As GDI may play a critical role in mediating thrombin-induced Rho activation and thus in signaling increased endothelial permeability, we addressed in this study the basis of Rho activation and its contribution in mediating the loss of endothelial barrier function induced by thrombin. The present results provide several lines of evidence that Rho-GDI phosphorylation and Rho activation are regulated by a PKC-dependent pathway in endothelial cells. We showed that thrombin as well as the direct activation of PKC by PMA induced the phosphorylation of Rho-GDI and that the Rho-GDI phosphorylation occurred concurrently with the thrombin-induced activation of Rho. Furthermore, the inhibition of PKC by chelerythrine (a specific but not isozyme-selective inhibitor of PKC) abrogated not only thrombin-induced Rho activation but also Rho-GDI phosphorylation. We also showed that the phosphorylation of GDI and Rho activation is regulated by phorbol ester-sensitive isozymes as the depletion of these isozymes by exposing HUVE cells to phorbol esters in the standard manner prevented thrombin-induced GDI phosphorylation and Rho activation. Because the PKC isozymes, -α, -β, -δ, and -ε, expressed in endothelial cells are all phorbol ester-sensitive, we used both pharmacological and genetic approaches to further identify the specific PKC isozyme regulating GDI phosphorylation and Rho activation. We found that the treatment of HUVE cells with LY379196 or rottlerin, which inhibits PKC-β or PKC-δ isozymes, respectively, failed to prevent Rho activation in response to thrombin in endothelial cells. Using dominant-negative mutant constructs, we showed that dominant-negative PKC-δ failed to prevent thrombin-induced SRE reporter gene activity that is regulated by Rho. Furthermore, we found that Rho-mediated SRE reporter gene activity in response to thrombin was completely prevented in endothelial cells transfected with the dominant-negative mutant of PKC-α, whereas PKC-ε had no significant effect on thrombin-induced SRE activation. Thus, these data demonstrate that PKC-α is the major kinase regulating Rho activation in endothelial cells. As the above findings indicate the critical role of PKC-α activation in the regulation of Rho activation, we usedin vitro kinase assay to test the possibility that PKC-α can directly phosphorylate GDI. Results of the in vitrokinase assay using PKC-α and PKC-ε immunoprecipitates from unstimulated and stimulated cells indicated that only PKC-α from activated cells was capable of inducing phosphorylation of GST-GDI. Thus, these findings indicate that the activation of PKC-α is required for phosphorylation of Rho-GDI, although the possibility cannot be ruled out that PKC may also activate another protein kinase controlling the phosphorylation state of GDI in HUVE cells. We also found in the pull-down assay that stimulation of endothelial cells with thrombin leads to a rapid association of PKC-α with the activated Rho, although it failed to associate with PKC-ε. The association of PKC-α with Rho after activation, although not in resting cells, indicates that the protein complex formation is probably important in targeting and regulating Rho function (14Hall A. Science. 1998; 280: 2074-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 47Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). However, our results do not distinguish between the possibility that association of PKC-α with Rho can occur directly or whether it is mediated by intermediate factors. There is little information regarding the role of different PKC isoforms in regulating the activation of Rho. Studies in endothelial and epithelial cells have implicated Rho in PMA-induced recruitment of PKC-α to the cell membrane (48Hippenstiel S. Kratz T. Krull M. Seybold J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Suttorp N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); however, these observations were not confirmed in bovine arterial endothelial cells (49Verin A.D. Liu F. Bogatcheva N. Borbiev T. Hershenson M.B. Wang P. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L360-L370PubMed Google Scholar). A permissive role of PKC-α but not PKC-δ in sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced Rho-A translocation from cytosol to membrane (an indirect measure of Rho activation) was also recently reported in C2C12 myoblasts (50Meacci E. Donati C. Cencetti F. Romiti E. Bruni P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, on the basis of using multiple approaches our results provide unequivocal evidence that PKC-α is a key upstream regulator of Rho activation. Several studies have implicated a critical role of PKC-dependent pathway in regulating thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability (3Lum H. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L223-L241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vuong P.T. Malik A.B. Nagpala P.G. Lum H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Aschner J.L.

Invest. 1990; 85: 1991-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We, therefore, measured changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (the basis of increased paracellular endothelial permeability) (31Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) using cells depleted of PKC by PMA treatment or cells treated with C3 transferase to inhibit Rho. We used these cells to address the possibility that PKC-induced barrier dysfunction can be explained by Rho activation. The results showed that thrombin caused a decrease in transendothelial electrical resistance, whereas depletion of PKC or inhibition of Rho reduced the response. Thus, these observations indicate that PKC induces the permeability increase activated by thrombin via the Rho-mediated pathway. What are the implications of PKC-α-induced GDI phosphorylation in the mechanism of Rho activation? It has been shown that the cytoplasmic pool of Rho-GTPase is complexed with GDI proteins (45Regazzi R. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17512-17519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, GDI can influence both the cellular localization and cycling of Rho proteins between GDP- and GTP-bound states. The dissociation of GDI from the Rho protein is a prerequisite for membrane association and its activation by Rho-GEFs (19Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 20Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In bovine neutrophils, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events have been implicated in the regulation of the dissociation of the Rho/Rho-GDI complex (51Bourmeyster N. Vignais P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on our results of thrombin-induced phosphorylation of GDI and Rho activation through a PKC-dependent pathway, we hypothesize that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of GDI may play a role in the mechanism of PKC-α-induced activation of Rho. Thus, the results of this study describe a novel pathway of GDI phosphorylation and Rho activation regulated by PKC-α and in signaling PKC-induced loss of endothelial barrier function.

Millions of people are infected worldwide with 400,000 new cases reported each year (1Ashford R.W. Desjeux P. deRaadt P. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 104-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). No effective vaccine is yet available against this parasite, and treatment relies primarily on antimony containing drugs, such as sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) and N-methylglucamine (Glucantime) (2Berman J.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 684-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 3Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar).

Our in vitro work on metal resistance inLeishmania has led to a model of resistance in which the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1protein PGPA plays a major role (9Ouellette M. Légaré D. Haimeur A. Grondin K. Roy G. Brochu C. Papadopoulou B. Drug Resistance Updates. 1998; 1: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ABC proteins are a large family of proteins, several of which are implicated in drug resistance (10Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). When discovered, PGPA was the most divergent of the eukaryotic ABC protein (11Ouellette M. Fase-Fowler F. Borst P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and when the multidrug resistance protein (MRP-1) was cloned and sequenced, PGPA was found to be its closest homologue (12Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Therefore, PGPA is a member of the MRP family, a large family of ABC transporters from which substrates include organic anions and drugs conjugated to glutathione (GSH), glucuronate, or sulfate (for review see Ref. 13Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). The link between PGPA and metal resistance in Leishmania is clear; the PGPA gene is frequently amplified inLeishmania cells that are selected for resistance to arsenite- or antimony-containing drugs (14Detke S.

In addition to PGPA amplification, we observed that the levels of trypanothione (TSH), a bisglutathione-spermidine conjugate specific for Trypanosomatidae (23Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), is increased in all the metal resistant Leishmania parasites that we have studied (18Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Roy G.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10383-10387Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). TSH is increased by the amplification of theGSH1 gene coding for γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) (25Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis, and by the overexpression of the ornithine decarboxylase geneODC (26Haimeur A. Guimond C. Pilote S. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Poulin R. Ouellette M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting step in spermidine biosynthesis. Increased levels of TSH by themselves are not sufficient to observe metal resistance, but the modulation of TSH levels by using specific inhibitors of γ-GCS or ODC will revert the resistance in mutants (26Haimeur A. Guimond C. Pilote S. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Poulin R. Ouellette M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the GSH1 or ODC andPGPA genes in partial revertants, but not in wild-type cells, will lead to synergistic levels of resistance (25Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Haimeur A. Guimond C. Pilote S. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Poulin R. Ouellette M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) strongly suggesting that PGPA recognizes metals conjugated to TSH. PGPA is therefore an important determinant of arsenite and antimonite resistance. However, the mechanism by which this ABC protein confers resistance is unclear. Transport experiments in arsenite resistantL. tarentolae mutants indicated the presence of an active efflux system that did not correlate with PGPA gene amplification (27Dey S. Papadopoulou B.

Liu H.Y. Lee S.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An analysis of L. tarentolae PGPA transfectants did not show a marked difference in the steady state accumulation of arsenite (21Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Dey S. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11980-19986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a decrease in the uptake of antimony was proposed to explain the resistance inLeishmania major PGPA transfectants (30Callahan H.L. Roberts W.L. Rainey P.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have proposed that PGPA is an intracellular ABC transporter that confers resistance by sequestration of metal-thiol conjugates (9Ouellette M. Légaré D. Haimeur A. Grondin K. Roy G. Brochu C. Papadopoulou B. Drug Resistance Updates. 1998; 1: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined the cellular location of PGPA and have studied its transport properties. The GSH1 plasmid was described elsewhere (25Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The PGPA constructs are summarized in Fig.1. A DNA sequence encoding the nine amino acids (YPYDVPDYA) of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was first introduced into the PGPA-containing plasmid pMAC6 (31White T.C. Fase-Fowler F. van Luenen H. Calafat J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16977-16983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR using this plasmid as template with primers A (5′-GGG-GAG-CTC-GTG-GCA-CAG-3′) and B (5′-CTT-TCT-AGA-GGG-CAT-AGT-CTG-GTA-CAT-CAT-ACG-GAT-ATC-CCG-GCT-GCA-CAA-TCC-G-3′). Primer A corresponds to the PGPA amino acids-encoding sequence GELVAQ, whereas primer B is complementary to sequences overlapping the COOH terminus of PGPA followed by the nine amino acids of HA and aXbaI restriction site (underlined). The reverse primer B also contains an EcoRV site (also underlined) betweenPGPA and the HA tag for in frame cloning of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The PCR fragment was digested withSalI (a unique restriction site cutting in PGPA) and XbaI and cloned into pMAC6, which was also digested withSalI (cutting in PGPA) and XbaI (cutting in the polylinker). This pMAC6HA version was subcloned into pSPYNEO (32Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to lead to the PGPAHA version. The absence of unwanted mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PGPAGFPHA hybrid was constructed by inserting the coding region of the GFP in the PGPAHA construct in the uniqueEcoRV site (Fig. 1). A 719-base pair GFP blunt PCR fragment was amplified by the PWO DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the primers GFP-1 (5′-CCA-TGG-TGA-GCA-AGG-GCG-AGG-AGC-3′) and GFP-2 (5′-ACT-TGT-ACA-GCT-CGT-CCA-TGC-CG-3′) using the phGFP-S65T plasmid (CLONTECH Laboratories) as a template. Promastigotes of L. tarentolae TarIIWT cell line were cultured at 28 °C in SDM-79 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The L. tarentolae PGPA null mutant and the arsenite revertant mutant As20.3rev have been described previously (15Ouellette M. Hettema E. Wust D. Fase-Fowler F. Borst P.

In experiments where tunicamycin (Sigma) was used, promastigote cultures were subdivided and grown without drug or with tunicamycin at 2 and 5 µg/ml. Reversion of resistance with 5 mml-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of γ-GCS (33Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol.

Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For detection of PGPAHA transfectants, cells were spotted into wells of coated slides, allowed to air dry, permeabilized at −20 °C with methanol for 15 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Incubations with primary and secondary antibodies (in the dark) were performed at room temperature for 1 h in a humidified chamber, each followed by three 5-min washes in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The polyclonal rabbit antibody HA.11 (Babco, Berkeley, CA) against the HA tag was used at 1:50 dilution in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin. The secondary antibody, an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) was used at 1:200 dilution in the same buffer. In some experiments, PGPAHAtransfectant cells were also revealed directly using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled-anti-HA antibody (Babco). Permeabilized fixed cells were examined by using a Nikon LaboPHot fluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. To visualize the nucleus and kinetoplast DNA, Rnase-pretreated cells were stained with propidium iodide. Evan's blue was used as a counterstain. Paraformaldehyde fixed cells were also examined by laser confocal microscopy as described previously (35Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For immunoelectron microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% or 2% formaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0, for 60 min on ice. FixedLeishmania cells were processed for ultrathin cryosection immunogold labeling as described previously (36Weise F. Stierhof Y.D. Kuhn C. Wiese M. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4587-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thawed frozen sections were reacted with rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (CLONTECH) or a monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody (HA.11, Babco, Richmond, VA) for 60 min each. Reactions were revealed using protein A-gold (6 nm) or goat anti-rabbit-IgG-Nanogold (Nanoprobes, Stony Brook, NY). A silver enhancement (silver lactate, gum arabic) of Nanogold was performed as described previously (37Stierhof Y.-D. Humbel B.M. Schwarz H. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 17: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Uranyl acetate staining and final embedding in 1.8% methylcellulose was done according to previously published methods (38Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1993: 45Google Scholar). Protein electrophoresis, protein transfer, and their reactions with polyclonal anti-PGPA (18Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Roy G.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 377Google Scholar). Cells were collected, washed, resuspended in an isosmotic balancer sorbitol buffer (4.4% (w/v) solution containing 10 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 7.8), and broken by abrasion using acid-washed glass beads (150–212 µm diameter, Sigma). More than 95% of the cells were disrupted as estimated by light microscopy. The homogenate was resuspended in sorbitol buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Unbroken cells and glass beads were sedimented, and the final supernatant (∼9 ml) was carefully layered onto the top of discontinuous (40:28:18:5%) iodixanol (Optiprep™) gradients. The gradients were centrifuged in a swinging bucket (SW41, Beckman) at 40,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C, and fractions (500 µl) were collected from the bottom. Each fraction was then diluted with sorbitol buffer and spin at 60,000 rpm for 1 h (TY70.1, Beckman). Pellets were washed 3 times with buffer C (75 mmHepes·KOH, 0.15 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) and resuspended in ∼300 µl of the same buffer and homogenized 3 times in a glass potter. Protein concentration was determined by the Amido Black method. The basal Mg2+-ATPase activity of the PGPAHA variant and the PGPA null mutant was determined by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP using a colorimetric method at 850 nm (40Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) as described by Shapiro and Ling (41Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the measurement of NTPase activities of mammalian ABC transporters. To inhibit the contribution of other contaminating ATPases, the ATPase assay was performed in the presence of sodium azide to inhibit F1F0-type ATPase activity and ouabain to inhibit Na/K-type ATPases. These inhibitors do not interfere with ABC-dependent drug transport (42Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Protein fractions (10 µg) were incubated at room temperature in a final volume of 45 µl of buffer assay (final concentrations: 60 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium azide, 2 mm ouabain). ATPase reaction was started by the addition of 5 µl of MgATP (7 mm MgSO4, 5 mmATP) for 20 min and stopped by the addition of 50 µl of 12% SDS. In preliminary attempts to stimulate the ATPase activity, we used arsenite or antimonite conjugated or not conjugated with glutathione or trypanothione (28Dey S. Ouellette M. Lightbody J. Papadopoulou B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in concentrations ranging from 100 nm to 1 mm. Cellular fractions of thePGPAHA transfectant, TarIIWT cell line, and PGPAnull mutant were isolated on iodixanol gradients as described above. Transport studies using 73AsO⨪2 and thiol complexes73As(GS)3 were carried essentially as described previously (28Dey S. Ouellette M. Lightbody J. Papadopoulou B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Frozen cellular fractions were thawed rapidly and stored on ice until use. The transport assay contained 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm73As(GS)3 or 73AsO⨪2 in buffer D (75 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 0.15 m KCl). Cellular fractions were added at 0.5 mg of protein/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 3 min, at which time the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to 10 mm. The total reaction volume was 0.3 ml. At the indicated intervals, samples (50 µl) were removed, filtered on wet nitrocellulose filters (0.22 µm pore size, Whatman), and washed with 5 ml of cold buffer D. The filters were dried, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Existing polyclonal antibodies against PGPA are useful for detecting this ABC protein in Western blots (18Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Mukhopadhyay R. Haimeur A. Dey S. Grondin K. Brochu C. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) but not for immunolocalization experiments (data not shown). For that reason, PGPA was tagged at the COOH terminus (Fig.1 A) with the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein, for which commercial antibodies are available. We also generated a PGPAGFPHA construct by fusing the coding portion of GFP in frame with PGPA (Fig.1 A). Both the PGPAHA and PGPAGFPHAconstructs were independently electroporated into Leishmaniacells. The HA.11 antibody recognized a protein of 175 kDa (Fig.1 B, lane 2) in the PGPAHAtransfectant, identical in size to wild-type PGPA (18Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Mukhopadhyay R. Haimeur A. Dey S. Grondin K. Brochu C. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In thePGPAGFPHA transfectant, a protein of ∼200 kDa reacted with the same commercial antibody, a size that commensurates with the presence of the 27 kDa of GFP protein in the fusion protein (Fig.1 B, lane 3). To demonstrate that PGPA is a membrane protein, we have fractionated PGPAHA-transfected cells by differential centrifugation and reacted the soluble and the membrane fractions with the HA.11 antibody. No PGPA was found in the supernatant fraction corresponding to the cytosol (Fig. 1 B,lane 4), and PGPAHA was found exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). The transfected PGPA-tagged versions led to proteins of the expected size as determined by Western blot analysis. Both tagged proteins gave the same resistance level to metals as the transfected untagged PGPA version (Table I), demonstrating that the epitope-tagged proteins are still functional. We have shown previously that co-transfection of GSH1 and PGPA in the revertant As20.3rev but not in wild-type cells will confer metal resistance in a synergistic manner (25Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Similarly, the co-transfection with GSH1 of either tagged versions of PGPAproduced higher resistance levels than the individual contribution of each determinant (Table I).Table IThiol dependence of PGPA-mediated resistanceGene(s) transfectedRelative resistanceTarIIWTAs20.3rev−BSO + DFMO−BSO + DFMOPSPYNEO1.01-150Average of at least three independent growth curves for each transfectant.1.01.01.0PGPA2.01.02.01.0PGPAHA2.01.02.01.0PGPAGFPHA2.21.12.11.1GSH11.01.02.01.0PGPA + GSH12.01.015.22.5PGPAHA +GSH12.01.015.02.6PGPAGFPHA +GSH12.11.115.22.61-150 Average of at least three independent growth curves for each transfectant. Open table in a new tab We have shown previously that the combination of the γ-GCS inhibitor BSO and the ODC inhibitor DFMO reversed resistance in arsenite or antimonite resistant mutants (19Haimeur A. Brochu C. Genest P. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Haimeur A. Guimond C. Pilote S. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Poulin R. Ouellette M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). On the basis of co-transfection experiments, we have proposed that PGPA is a thiol-X pump (25Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but the combination BSO + DFMO was never used before on PGPAtransfectants. This combination indeed decreased PGPA-mediated resistance either in a wild-type or revertant background (Table I), and the tagged PGPA versions had similar properties. The combination BSO + DFMO was more effective in reversing resistance than BSO or DFMO alone (data not shown). Overall, these results suggest that the PGPAHA and PGPAGFPHA fusions confer the same phenotype as the overexpressed wild-type PGPA protein. This was further substantiated by the ability of the tagged PGPA versions to reverse metal hypersensitivity in aPGPA knockout cell (22Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Dey S. Rosen B.P. Olivier M. Ouellette M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (data not shown). PGPA versions tagged with HA or GFP were localized within the cells using HA antibodies or GFP fluorescence. The anti-HA antibody was used to detect the PGPAHA protein by immunofluorescence. Non-permeabilizedLeishmania cells expressing PGPAHA did not react with HA-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody (Fig.2 A). However, when cells were permeabilized, a strong signal was observed upon reaction with the antibody. Indeed, a discrete bright fluorescent spot was observed within the cell at or close to the flagellar pocket (Fig.2 B). The flagellar pocket is located at the base of the flagellum and is considered to be the sole site for endocytosis and exocytosis in Kinetoplastidae (43Balber A.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar, 44Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with GFP alone displayed fluorescence throughout the cell (Fig. 2 C), whereas cells transfected with the PGPAGFPHA fusion revealed a discrete fluorescent spot located at a position similar to the PGPAHA protein at or close to the flagellar pocket (Fig. 2 D). The same localization of PGPA was observed in L. tarentolae wild-type or As20.3rev or in Leishmania donovani cells transfected withPGPAGFPHA (data not shown). The location of the PGPAGFPHA protein was also observed by confocal microscopy. The nuclei and kinetoplast DNA were labeled with propidium iodide, whereas the autofluorescence of GFP was used to locate the PGPAGFPHA protein. Interestingly, this fusion was located just below the kinetoplast (Fig.2 E) at a position close to or at the flagellar pocket. By confocal microscopy, a second region of fluorescence between the nucleus and the kinetolpast has been detected in parasites highly overexpressing PGPA. This location possibly corresponds to the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, it is possible that PGPA passes through the Golgi before reaching a membrane close to the flagellar pocket. However, preliminary experiments using subinhibitory to partially inhibitory concentrations of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin failed to demonstrate that PGPA was N-glycosylated (data not shown). To localize PGPAGFPHA more precisely, electron microscopy with immunogold labeling was employed. The fusion protein was detected using an anti-GFP antibody with silver-enhanced Nanogold (Fig.3 A) or 6-nm gold particles (Fig. 3, B and C). Clearly, the flagellar pocket membrane was not labeled (Fig. 3). Instead, the antibody reacted with vesicular and tubular membranes (Fig. 3, B and C) very close to the L. tarentolae flagellar pocket membrane, which appear to be part of the recently described tubular clusters (36Weise F. Stierhof Y.D. Kuhn C. Wiese M. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 45"

NQO1−/− mice deficient in NQO1 activity and protein were generated in our laboratory (Rajendirane, V., Joseph, P., Lee, Y. H., Kimura, S., Klein-Szanto, A. J. P., Gonzalez, F. J., and Jaiswal, A. K.

In the present report, we show that NQO1−/− mice exhibit significantly lower levels of abdominal adipose tissue as compared with the wild-type mice. The NQO1−/− mice showed lower blood levels of glucose, no change in insulin, and higher levels of triglycerides, β-hydroxy butyrate, pyruvate, lactate, and glucagon as compared with wild-type mice.

The liver glycogen reserve was found decreased in NQO1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice. The livers and kidneys from NQO1−/− mice also showed significantly lower levels of pyridine nucleotides but an increase in the reduced/oxidized NAD(P)H:NAD(P) ratio. These results suggested that loss of NQO1 activity alters the intracellular redox status by increasing the concentration of NAD(P)H. This leads to a reduction in pyridine nucleotide synthesis and reduced glucose and fatty acid metabolism.

The two-electron reduction of quinones does not result in the formation of free radicals (semiquinones) and highly reactive oxygen species, hence protecting cells against the adverse effects of quinones and their derivatives (1Radjendirane V.

As a protective agent, NQO1 activity has been shown to prevent the formation of highly reactive quinone metabolites (4Chesis P.L. Levin D.E. Smith M.T. Ernster L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Recently, NQO1 was also shown to reduce benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene quinone induced mutagenicity (7Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Br. J.

NQO1 activity is present in all tissues but at different levels (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol.

Various investigators have observed large variations in NQO1 activity between individuals, in different tissues from the same individual, and between normal/tumor tissues (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T.

It is generally accepted that tumor tissues and cells of hepatic and colonic origin express higher levels of NQO1, as compared with normal tissues and cells of similar origins (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D.

Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The normal tissue that surrounds the hepatic tumors also expresses higher levels of the NQO1 gene, presumably to play an unknown role in tumor progression (9Cresteil T. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). NQO1 gene expression is induced in response to xenobiotics, antioxidants, oxidants, heavy metals, UV light, and ionizing radiation (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11475-11478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, NQO1 is part of an electrophilic and/or oxidative stress-induced cellular defense mechanism that includes the induction of more than two dozen genes (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T.

The coordinated induction of these genes, including NQO1, presumably provides cellular protection against free radical damage, oxidative stress, and neoplasia. Despite the large volume of knowledge about NQO1, the in vivo role of NQO1 remains unknown. To examine the in vivo role of NQO1, we used targeted gene disruption to generate NQO1−/− mice (11Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Lee Y.H. Kimura S. Klein-Sazanto A.J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7382-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These mice are born normal and reproduce normally. However, the NQO1−/− mice exhibited increased toxicity to menadione when compared with the wild-type mice. In the present study, we demonstrate that NQO1−/− mice exhibit a significant reduction or absence of abdominal adipose tissue, as compared with the wild-type mice. We also demonstrate that several metabolic pathways are altered in NQO1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice. This was evident from lower blood levels of glucose and higher levels of triglycerides, β-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, pyruvate, and glucagon in NQO1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice. The NQO1−/− mice livers showed lower levels of glycogen but higher levels of glucose, triglycerides, lactate, and pyruvate. We further demonstrate that NQO1−/− mice are insulin resistant as compared with wild-type mice. In addition, the NQO1−/− mice livers and kidneys showed decreased pyridine nucleotides but higher NAD(P)H:NAD(P) ratio as compared with wild-type mice. These results suggest that NQO1 plays a significant role in regulation of intracellular redox status and hence metabolic pathways leading to the accumulation of abdominal adipose tissue. C57BL6 NQO1−/− and wild-type mice were bred in our laboratory (11Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Lee Y.H. Kimura S. Klein-Sazanto A.J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol.

The animals were housed in polycarbonate cages, maintained with a 12-h light/dark cycle, a temperature of 24 ± 2 °C, a relative humidity of 55 ± 10%, and a negative atmospheric pressure. The mice were fed standard rodent chow and acidified tap water ad libitum. Twenty-four-, 48-, and 72-week-old male and female mice were used in the present studies. However, because of the similarity in the results the data are shown only for male mice. Animals received humane care throughout the experiment according to AALAC guidelines for animal welfare. Mice were anesthetized by a brief exposure to isoflurane (VEDCO Inc., St. Joseph, MO). The mice were then given a 0.25-ml intraperitoneal injection of 50% urethane. Blood was extracted from the hearts with a 1-ml EDTA-coated syringe/22G1 needle and placed in Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were inverted several times to ensure uniform clotting. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The serum was withdrawn from the tubes and frozen at −20 °C until analysis. Blood and tissue samples were taken at the same time of the day. In related experiments, animals were fasted for 16 h and blood was drawn for analysis as described earlier. The glucose and triglyceride levels were analyzed in the serum samples using a Cobas Mira System and Sigma reagents. β-Hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and pyruvate levels were measured using Sigma Diagnostic Kits and protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Linco Research Inc. (St. Charles, MO) using a sensitive radioimmunoassay kit for the determination of concentration of glucagon and insulin in the serum. The insulin tolerance test was performed by previously described method (12Takashi M. Kazuaki N. Fumi T. Kazumi K. Hideyuki Y. Atsuko T. Tohru G. Toshiko I. Jun-ichi M. Susumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Seventy-two-week-old wild-type and age-matched NQO1−/− mice were used. The mice were fasted for 16 h but given water ad libitum. Insulin (0.15 IU/kg body weight) was administered by intraperitonial injection of insulin to the fasted mice. The blood was drawn by retro-orbital bleeding and analyzed for blood glucose using the Accu Chek kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The various tissues (liver and kidney) from 24-week-old wild-type and NQO1−/− mice were homogenized in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.25m sucrose. This homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosolic fractions. Dicoumarol-sensitive NQO1 activity was determined in all cytosolic fractions by a previously described method (13Shaw P.M. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. Schembri J. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The various cytosolic fractions were also analyzed for NQO1 protein by Western blotting using antibodies against the purified rat liver NQO1 protein (13Shaw P.M. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. Schembri J. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The rat NQO1 antibody is known to cross-react with mouse and human proteins (13Shaw P.M.

Western blots were developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) reagents by the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Two different procedures were used to collect and process the tissues for determination of various metabolites and oxidized and reduced pyridine nucleotide levels because of sensitivity of these molecules. In the classical method, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation (15Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The tissues were surgically removed and instantlyfrozen in liquid nitrogen and weighed in frozen condition (15Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the freeze-clamping method, the mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, tissues perfused, and prepared using freeze-clamping device (16Lazzarino G. Nuutinen M. Tavazzi B. Di Pierro D.

The frozen liver was weighed, cut into pieces, and homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6) and a set of protease inhibitors containing 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml benzamidine-Cl, and 10 μm leupeptin. The homogenate was extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration). The sample was allowed to precipitate for 30 min on ice and a clear supernatant was obtained by centrifuging the samples at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was neutralized to pH 7.6 using Tris-Cl buffer. Lactate, pyruvate, and β-hydroxybutyrate were measured in the various samples using the Sigma Diagnostic Kits and the manufacturer's protocols. Glucose and triglycerides were estimated using a Cobas Mira System and Sigma Diagnostic Kit. Glycogen reserve in the liver tissues were measured by a procedure as previously described (18Roy B.D. Tarnopolsky M.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 890-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Johann C. Lentini E. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The classical and freeze-clamping techniques yielded more or less similar results for various metabolites. Therefore, the values from both these methods were combined. The mice liver and kidney tissues collected by classical and freeze-clamping methods were homogenized in chilled buffer containing 200 mm KCN, 1 mm bathophenanthroline, and 60 mm KOH using a Potter-Elvejham homogenizer system. The pyridines were extracted and analyzed from these tissues by procedures as previously described (15Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, the homogenate was extracted rapidly with chloroform several times until minimal precipitate was observed at the interface of the buffer and chloroform. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.45-μm Ultrafree-MC filtration device (Millipore) by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. This removes any residual DNA/protein and also serves as a filter before the samples are loaded onto the HPLC column. The various pyridine nucleotides (NAD, NADH, NADP, and NADPH) were separated, analyzed, and quantitated using a C18 chromatography column (Waters) and HPLC (Waters). The mobile phase consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.05):acetonitrile (97:3) as suggested by the manufacturer. The RF values of the NAD, NADP, NADH, and NADPH standards were calculated and employed for quantitation of the pyridine nucleotides in the various samples under identical conditions. The classical and freeze-clamping techniques yielded quite similar results. Therefore, the values from both these methods were combined. Wild-type (NQO1+/+) and NQO1−/− mice were analyzed for NQO1 activity and protein levels (Fig. 1). The highest amount of NQO1 activity was observed in the kidney, followed by the liver and abdominal adipose tissue. The NQO1 activities were similar for male and female mice, therefore, the data has been combined. NQO1 activity was not detected in the kidney or abdominal adipose tissue from NQO1− mice. However, the livers from NQO1−/− mice contained a small amount (<15% of wild type) of NQO1 activity. Western blot analysis did not detect any NQO1 protein in these three tissues (liver, kidney, and abdominal adipose), but did detect NQO1 protein in similar tissues from wild-type (NQO1+/+) mice. The small amounts of NQO1 activity detected in the liver of NQO1−/− mice may be due to an isoenzymic form of NQO1, since the NQO1 protein was not detected in Western analysis of NQO1−/− liver tissue (Fig. 1). A comparison of total body weight of wild-type and NQO1−/− mice was performed. The results indicated that NQO1−/− mice were significantly lighter in weight as compared with wild-type mice at all the three (24, 48, and 72 weeks old) ages of mice studied (TableI).Table ITotal body weight of wild-type and NQO1−/− miceAgeBody weight1-aMean ± S.D. of 10 mice.

Open table in a new tab The results of the analysis of the abdominal adipose tissue in 24-, 48-, and 72-week-old wild-type and NQO1−/− mice are shown in Fig.2. The amount of abdominal adipose tissue increased with age in the wild-type mice. In contrast to the wild-type mice, the NQO1−/− mice did not accumulate abdominal adipose tissue with age. This resulted in a significant reduction of abdominal adipose tissue in NQO1−/− mice, especially in the older animals. The 24- and 48-week-old NQO1−/− mice showed a 20 and 38% reduction in abdominal adipose tissue, as compared with age-matched wild-type controls. The most significant (p < 0.001) reduction in adipose tissue, between wild-type and NQO1−/− mice, was observed in 72-week-old mice (Figs. 2 and 3). They showed a 326% reduction in abdominal adipose tissue, as compared with age-matched wild-type mice.Figure 3Abdominal adipose tissue in 72-week-old wild-type and NQO1−/− mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Serum glucose levels of 24-, 48-, and 72-week-old wild-type and NQO1−/− mice are shown in Table II. Serum glucose decreased by 11% (p < 0.1), 35% (p < 0.01), and 36% (p < 0.001) in 24-, 48-, and 72-week-old NQO1−/− mice, when compared with the age matched wild-type mice (Table II). An increase in the pyruvate (37%,p < 0.01), lactate (18%, p < 0.05), triglycerides (18%, p < 0.05), and β-hydroxybutyrate (48%, p < 0.007) contents were observed in the serum of 72-week-old NQO−/− mice over the age-matched controls (Table II). Similar results were also observed with mice fasted for 16 h. The concentration of serum glucose decreased by 20% (p < 0.01) and triglycerides showed an increase by 22% (p < 0.05) in the 72-week-old NQO1−/− mice as compared with the age-matched wild-type mice. These changes were more or less similar to that observed when mice were fed ad libitum. However, the serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels showed significantly higher differences in fasted mice as compared with mice fed ad libitum. The NQO1−/− mice showed a 69% increase (p < 0.005) in the 72-week-old NQO1−/− when compared with the wild-type mice after 16 h of fasting (Table II). The NQO1−/− mice livers also demonstrated a marked increase in the concentration of metabolites such as glucose (105%, p< 0.01), lactate (48%, p < 0.005), pyruvate (79%,p < 0.005), and triglycerides (180% p< 0.005) as compared with wild-type mice (TableIII). However, liver glycogen reserve of NQO−/− mice was decreased by 27% (p < 0.025) as compared with the wild-type mice (Table III). Among the hormones that regulate metabolism, no significant alterations were observed in blood-insulin concentrations between NQO1−/− and wild-type mice (Table IV). However, glucagon levels exhibited a 30% increase (p < 0.05) in the NQO1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice (Table IV). The insulin tolerance test in the 16-h fasted wild-type mice showed that the blood glucose levels in these mice decreased by about 18, 28, and 32% in 20, 40, and 60 min, respectively, after insulin was administered to the animals. In the NQO1−/− mice the decrease of blood glucose was 6, 9, and 17% at 20 min, 40 and 60 min after administration of insulin (TableV).Table IIConcentration of various metabolites in serum of wild-type and NQO1−/− mice (mg/dL)AgeGlucosePyruvateLactateTriglyceridesβ-Hydroxybutyrateweeks242-aAll mice fed ad libitum.Wild-type271 ± 372.35 ± 0.29728.5 ± 3.9153 ± 81.98 ± 0.62NQO1−/−241 ± 16 (0.1)2.85 ± 0.313 (0.05)32.2 ± 5.85 (0.1)52 ± 7 (0.1)2.90 ± 0.20 (0.01)482-aAll mice fed ad libitum.Wild-type293 ± 592.83 ± 0.49933.7 ± 3.0154 ± 132.30 ± 0.41NQO1−/−191 ± 53 (0.01)3.75 ± 0.767 (0.01)40.1 ± 9.43 (0.1)64 ± 3 (0.05)2.88 ± 0.32 (0.03)722-aAll mice fed ad libitum.Wild-type285 ± 172.92 ± 0.36236.4 ± 5.2157 ± 72.43 ± 0.39NQO1−/−183 ± 11 (0.001)3.99 ± 0.422 (0.025)42.8 ± 7.22 (0.05)69 ± 13 (0.05)3.59 ± 0.61 (0.007)722-bMice fasted for 16 h.Wild-type191 ± 06ND2-cND, not done.ND68 ± 130.95 ± 0.13NQO1−/−153 ± 16 (0.01)NDND83 ± 15 (0.05)1.61 ± 0.22 (0.005)Mean ± S.D. of six mice.

The amounts of NAD, NADP, NADH, and NADPH and the ratios of NADH/NAD and NADPH/NADP in the liver and kidney tissues of wild type and NQO1−/− mice are shown in Table VI for 24- and Table VII for 48-week-old mice. Seventy-two-week-old mice also showed similar changes as shown for 48-week-old mice (data are not shown). There was a significant decrease in the levels of NAD, NADP, NADH, and NADPH in the liver of 24-, 48-, and 72-week-old NQO1−/− mice, as compared with the age-matched wild-type mice (Tables VI and VII). At 24, 48, and 72 weeks of age, NADH/NAD and NADPH/NADP ratios were significantly higher in the liver of NQO1−/− mice, as compared with the wild-type mice. Similar changes were also observed in the kidney of NQO1−/− mice, as compared with wild-type mice. However, the magnitude of changes in pyridine nucleotide levels and NAD(P)H:NAD(P) ratio were less significant than liver.Table VINAD(P)H:NAD(P) ratio in liver and kidney tissues of 24-week-old wild-type and NQO1−/− miceNAD6-aMicromoles/g of tissue.NADH6-aMicromoles/g of tissue.NADH/NADNADH/NAD ratioTissueLiverWild-type0.412 ± 0.0470.104 ± 0.0190.252 ± 0.035NQO1−/−0.269 ± 0.075 (0.002)0.079 ± 0.019 (0.05)0.294 ± 0.055 (0.05)KidneyWild-type0.315 ± 0.0990.115 ± 0.0460.387 ± 0.075NQO1−/−0.233 ± 0.083 (0.2)0.101 ± 0.011 (0.4)0.431 ± 0.081 (0.4)NADP6-aMicromoles/g of tissue.NADPH6-aMicromoles/g of tissue.NADPH/NADPNADPH/NADP ratioTissueLiverWild-type0.097 ± 0.0240.184 ± 0.0271.820 ± 0.402NQO1−/−0.053 ± 0.021 (0.01)0.145 ± 0.031 (0.05)2.690 ± 0.298 (0.03)KidneyWild-type0.068 ± 0.0310.139 ± 0.0651.970 ± 0.202NQO1−/−0.049 ± 0.021 (0.4)0.127 ± 0.025 (0.7)2.430 ± 0.265 (0.03)Mean ± S.D. of six mice.

The pattern of alterations in abdominal adipose tissue, NAD(P)H:NAD(P) ratios, and levels of glucose, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate observed in male mice were also observed in female mice (data not shown). However, the alterations were of lower magnitude in the female NQO1−/− mice. The NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases are enzymes that are present in all tissues (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol.

In humans, genetic evidence indicates that different forms of NQOs are encoded by four gene loci (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 173-179Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 3Riley R.J. Workman P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Two of these gene loci (NQO1 and NQO2) encode proteins that constitute ∼85% of the total cellular NQO activity (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar). Among all the NQOs known so far, cytosolic NQO1 is highly abundant and is the most extensively studied enzyme (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar). In the present report, NQO1−/− mice were used to examine the in vivo role of NQO1. NQO1−/− mice showed significant decreases in total body weight and abdominal adipose tissue, as compared with the wild-type mice. The decrease in abdominal adipose tissue was more significant in older mice than younger mice. This obvious difference in older (72 weeks) animals was due to accumulation of abdominal adipose tissue in the wild-type mice and lower (or no) accumulation of adipose tissue in the aging NQO1−/− mice. The possible reasons for the decreased abdominal adipose tissue may be inefficient fat synthesis, ineffective fat deposition, and/or degradation of adipose tissue. A decrease in blood glucose and increase in blood and liver lactic and pyruvic acid indicated that glucose (gluconeogenesis) and possibly fatty acid synthesis are decreased in NQO1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice. The lactic and pyruvic acid are two key substrates for gluconeogenesis, a metabolic pathway to synthesize glucose (20Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 598-641Google Scholar). Their accumulation in blood and liver strongly indicated that glucose synthesis is down-regulated in NQO1−/− mice (20Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 598-641Google Scholar). The lower levels of blood glucose and higher levels of serum glucagon in NQO1−/− mice presumably stimulated glycogenolysis in the livers of NQO1−/− mice leading to increased production of glucose due to breakdown of glycogen to meet with the energy requirements of the liver. This is supported by an increase in glucose and decrease in glycogen of liver in NQO1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice. The increase in glucagon is also known to stimulate gluconeogenesis (21Mokuda O. Sakamoto Y. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2000; 108: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, this may not be the case in NQO1−/− mice that demonstrated accumulation of pyruvate and lactate in liver, two substrates for gluconeogenesis. Therefore, it is likely that most of the glucose in the liver came from the breakdown of glycogen reserves rather than gluconeogenesis. It is surprising though that there is sufficient glucose in the liver, yet the serum glucose is low and the circulating insulin concentration is also unchanged in NQO1−/− mice. It is possible that NQO1−/− mice liver requires glucose as its major energy source due to down-regulation of other metabolic processes leading to increased requirement of glucose in the livers of NQO1−/− mice. However, the possibility of inefficient glucose transport from the liver in NQO1−/− mice cannot be ruled out. The insulin tolerance test demonstrated that NQO1−/− mice are insulin resistant as compared with the wild-type mice. However, the insulin resistance did not appear to be of severe form as observed in the case of lipodystrophic mice (22Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R. Bashmakov Y. Brown M. Goldstein J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). We believe that high triglyceride content in the peripheral blood of the NQO1−/− mice is one of the factors causing insulin resistance in NQO1−/− mice. The increase in serum and liver triglycerides in NQO1−/− mice when compared with wild-type mice may suggest that the breakdown of accumulated fat also contributed to lower abdominal adipose tissue in the NQO1−/− mice. An increase in β-hydroxybutyrate in NQO1−/− mice also supported breakdown of adipose tissue. It is known that β-hydroxybutyrate is synthesized from fatty acids generated after the breakdown of adipose tissue and serves as alternative source of energy in tissues like brain (20Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 598-641Google Scholar, 23Kashiwaya Y. Takeshima T. Mori N. Nakashima K. Clarke K. Veech L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5440-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The hypoglycemic condition in NQO1−/− mice presumably activated alternative pathways of energy generation in NQO1−/− mice that led to increase in β-hydroxybutyrate production. At this time, however, the role of inefficient dietary fat deposition in the adipocytes of NQO1−/− mice in addition to down-regulation of glucose and fat synthesis and increased fat breakdown remains unknown. The studies on metabolic precursors and substrates have provided sufficient evidence that glucose and fat metabolic pathways are altered in NQO1−/− mice as compared with wild-type mice. It is known that a physiologically favorable equilibrium between the reduced and oxidized forms of NAD(P) is crucial for many of the enzymatic reactions that catalyze reactions leading to the synthesis of pyridine nucleotides, glucose, and adipose tissue (20Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 598-641Google Scholar). Any alteration in the intracellular levels of NAD(P)H and NAD(P) is known to affect the pentose phosphate pathway that generates pentoses for synthesis of pyridine nucleotides, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism (20Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 598-641Google Scholar). In the present studies, NQO1−/− mice showed decreased pyridine nucleotide levels but higher ratios of NADPH:NADP and NADH:NAD. NQO1 is known to utilize NAD(P)H as an electron donor, which generates NAD(P) (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 173-179Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 3Riley R.J. Workman P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, the loss of NQO1 in NQO1−/− mice resulted in the accumulation of NAD(P)H and alterations in the intracellular redox status. The accumulation of NAD(P)H presumably inhibited the pentose phosphate pathway leading to lower levels of pyridine nucleotides in NQO1−/− mice, as compared with wild-type mice. The lower levels of pyridine nucleotides may have contributed to the decrease in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid metabolism (20Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1993: 598-641Google Scholar). Therefore, an altered intracellular redox state, caused by higher ratios of NAD(P)H:NAD(P) may be a major factor that contributed to the down-regulation of gluconeogenesis and adipose synthesis in NQO1−/− mice. These results raise an interesting question regarding the endogenous substrate(s) for NQO1, utilizing NAD(P)H?. Earlier studies have suggested that NQO1 reduces CoQ and protects membranes from oxidative damage (24Beyer R.E. Segura-Aguilar J. Di Bernardo S. Cavazzoni M. Fato R. Fiorentini D. Galli M.C. Setti M. Landi L. Lenaz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). There may be other cellular molecules that serve as substrates for NQO1 but remain unknown. There are several proteins that contain nitrotyrosines (25Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biphys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and many proteins contain quinones as cofactors (26Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is possible that NQO1 catalyzes the reduction of nitrotyrosines or quinone cofactors, thus affecting the structure, function, and/or stability of these proteins. Future experiments should reveal more information on the endogenous substrates for NQO1. The possibility that NQO1 participates in pathways such as the citric acid and pentose phosphate pathways, as shown for the bacterial malate oxidoreductase, cannot be ruled out (27Kather B. Stingl K. Van der Rest M.E. Attendorf K. Molenaar D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3204-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A model is depicted in Fig. 4 to describe the role of NQO1 in the regulation of intracellular redox status and gluconeogenesis. NQO1 utilizes NAD(P)H as an electron donor and catalyzes the two-electron reduction of known/unknown endogenous substances and quinones (1Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Cadenas E. Forman H.J. Oxidative Stress and Signal Transduction. Chapman and Hall, New York1997: 441-475Crossref Google Scholar, 2Talalay P. Fahey J.W. Holtzclaw W.D. Prestera T. Zhang Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 173-179Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 3Riley R.J. Workman P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This reaction generates oxidized NAD(P), which maintains a balance between NAD(P)H and NAD(P). This balance, between the reduced and oxidized form of NAD(P), contributes to the intracellular redox status that is optimal for pyridine nucleotides, glucose synthesis, and fatty acid metabolism. Excess glucose and fatty acids, through metabolic pathways, are converted to triglycerides that accumulate in the abdominal adipose tissue. Disruption of the NQO1 gene leads to the loss of NQO1 protein, a decrease in the concentration of all pyridines (NAD, NADH, NADP, and NADPH) and accumulation of NADH and NADPH. This leads to an increased intracellular NAD(P)H:NAD(P) ratio that results in an altered intracellular redox status. These changes decrease pyridine nucleotide synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism, resulting in lower quantities of abdominal adipose tissue. The lower blood glucose levels may also stimulate degradation of accumulated adipose tissues to meet the demands of various tissues, including the brain. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that NQO1 plays an important role in regulating the intracellular redox levels by oxidizing NAD(P)H. The loss of NQO1 leads to alterations in pyridine and intracellular redox status. This decreases gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, and significantly reduces the amount of abdominal adipose tissue. We are thankful to our colleagues for discussion. Technical help provided by J. Hariharan for HPLC analysis is greatly appreciated."

In the present study, we show that exposure of cardiomyocytes to ischemia induced the phosphorylation of STAT-1 at another site, Ser-727. Moreover, STAT-1 is critical for the induction of Fas receptor and Fas ligand expression by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Transcriptional activation of Fas and FasL was dependent on Ser-727 of STAT-1 but was independent of Tyr-701. Similarly, Ser-727 but not Tyr-701 was required for enhancement of cardiomyocyte cell death by STAT-1 during I/R. In addition, inhibition of the p38 pathway prevented the induction and transcriptional activation of Fas and FasL in cardiac cells exposed to I/R, whereas inhibition of p42/p44 MAPK had no effect. Finally, I/R also induced phosphorylation of STAT-1 on Ser-727 and expression of Fas/FasL in ventricular myocytes in the intact heart ex vivo. These results indicate that Fas/FasL genes and apoptosis are activated by STAT-1 in cardiac myocytes exposed to I/R and these effects are dependent on the Ser-727 but not the Tyr-701 phosphorylation sites of STAT-1.

Res. 1996; 79: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that apoptotic death occurs in cardiac cells exposed to a variety of damaging stimuli both in vitro and in the intact heart in vivo (3Umansky S.R. Cuenco G.M.

J. Med. 1996; 335: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Thus, cardiac cells exposed to a hypoxic/ischemic insult followed by reperfusion undergo apoptotic cell death in vitro (3Umansky S.R. Cuenco G.M. Khutzian S.S. Barr P.J. Tomei L.D. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar, 6Narula J. Haider N. Virmani R. Di Salvo T.G. Kolodgie F.D. Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Semigran M.J. Dec W.G. Khaw B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Similarly, apoptotic cell death is also observed in the intact heart following ischemia in vivo (4Cheng W. Kajstura J. Nitahara J.A. Li B. Reiss K. Liu Y. Clark W.A. Krajfwski S. Reed J.C. Olivetti G. Anversa P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 5Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O.

Despite the convincing evidence that apoptosis occurs, the mechanisms and signaling pathways which lead to apoptosis following hypoxic/ischemic stimuli in cardiac cells are as yet unknown. The Fas (CD95)/Fas ligand (CD95L) system is a key regulator of apoptosis. Fas, a 48-kDa transmembrane receptor glycoprotein, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily of surface molecules (7Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar), and Fas expression is enhanced in cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia (8Tanaka M. Itoh H. Adachi S. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The Fas ligand (FasL) which binds to the Fas receptor belongs to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of cytokines and can exist as a membrane-bound or a soluble protein. Binding of Fas by its cognate ligand FasL mediates the recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain adapter molecule to the receptor complex. In turn, the upstream procaspase-8 is attracted to the complex and undergoes autoproteolytic activation (9Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V. Chiannilkulchai N. Beckmann J.S. Met I.L. Rebrikov D. Brodianski V.M. Kember O.C. Kollet O. Soffer D. Sobe T Avraham K.B. Goncharov H. Lonai P. Wallach D. Immunity. 1998; 2: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). This then leads to the activation of downstream caspases including caspase-3, followed by cleavage of key regulatory proteins resulting in apoptosis (9Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V. Chiannilkulchai N. Beckmann J.S. Met I.L. Rebrikov D. Brodianski V.M. Kember O.C. Kollet O. Soffer D. Sobe T Avraham K.B. Goncharov H. Lonai P. Wallach D. Immunity. 1998; 2: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Cytokines and growth factors are known to modulate growth, survival, and death in many cell types. These pro- and anti-apoptotic effects are mediated, at least in part, by signaling through a family of transcription factors called signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs).1 Six STATs have been cloned, some of which exist in different isomeric forms, and all share a high degree of conservation of their structural domains (10Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Ihle J. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). These include a DNA-binding domain, a site for homo- or heterodimer formation and also conserved residues for tyrosine and serine phosphorylation by Janus protein kinases (JAKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (p42/44 and p38 MAPKs), respectively (12Zang X. Blenis J. Li H. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1894-1990Google Scholar, 13Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1414-1417Crossref Scopus (5025) Google Scholar). STATs phosphorylated by JAK/MAPK dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they transactivate STAT responsive genes. Recent studies have implicated STATs in both pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. For example, a STAT-1 deficient cell line is resistant to tumor necrosis factor α-induced apoptosis (14Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and STAT-1 has been implicated in transcriptional activation of some caspases (15Chin Y.E. Kitagawa B. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In contrast, a dominant negative form of STAT-3 has been shown to prevent interleukin-6-dependent cell growth and induce apoptosis in a myeloid cell line (16Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of IFN α/β to rescue T cell clones from apoptosis induced by interleukin-2 withdrawal is dependent on STAT-2 (17Kaneko S. Suzuki N. Koizumi H. Yamamoto S. Sakane T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 109: 165-193Google Scholar), and the anti-apoptotic effects of interleukin-9 appear to involve homo/hetero dimers of STAT-1, -3, and -5 (18Bauer J.H. Lui K.D. Lai S.Y. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9255-9260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently we have started to assess the role of STATs in mediating pro- and anti-apoptotic signals in the heart. For example, we have recently demonstrated that STAT-1 activation plays a critical role in inducing apoptosis in cardiac cells exposed to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in a caspase-1-dependent manner (19Stephanou A. Brar B. Knight R.A. Marber M.S. Yellon D. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10002-10008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that the phosphorylated active form of STAT-1 reduces the basal activity of the promoters of the anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-2and Bcl-x, whereas STAT-3 increases promoter activity. Hence, STAT-1 and STAT-3 have opposing actions on the Bcl-2 and Bcl-x promoters (20Stephanou A. Brar B. Knight R.A. Latchman D.S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 329-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To extend these studies we have investigated the role of STAT-1 in regulating expression of Fas and Fas ligand during I/R of cardiac myocytes and in the intact perfused heart ex vivo. The STAT-1, STAT1-Ser-727 mutant (serine to alanine) and STAT1-Tyr-701 mutant (tyrosine to phenylalanine) expression vectors were kindly provided by Curt Horvath (Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York). The STAT-1 antisense vector was constructed by inserting the STAT-1 cDNA in the antisense orientation into the pcDNA3 vector. The dominant negative MKK6 construct was kindly provided by Eisuke Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Genomic DNA fragments including the Fas (21Wada N. Matsumura M. Ohda Y. Kobayashi N. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18007-18012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and FasL promoter regions were obtained from a human DNA library, and placed upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. The Fas and FasL promoter regions extended to nucleotide positions −1436 and −2373, respectively, with respect to the transcription start site as +1. The structure of the FasL promoter will be described elsewhere. The STAT-1 reporter gene, was constructed by ligating a STAT-1-binding site from SIEm67 DNA (5′-GATCTGATTACGGGAAATG-3′) into pGL2-luciferase (Promega). Transfection of reporter construct and expression vectors into cardiac cells, as performed by the calcium phosphate method. The STAT-1-deficient cells (U3A) was kindly provided by Dr. Ian Kerr (ICRF, London). Ventricular myocytes isolated from the hearts of neonatal rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) that were less than 2 days old were cultured as described previously (22Stephanou A. Brar B. Heads R. Knight R.A. Marber M.S. Pennica D. Latchman D.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 849-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After collagenase digestion the cells were pre-plated in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1000 µg of glucose/liter, 1 mmol/literl-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Pre-plating of the cell suspension for 30 min allows contaminating fibroblasts to attach and the myocytes remain free within the culture media. Subsequent to this incubation, the cardiac myocyte cell suspension was transferred onto six-well (3 cm) gelatin-coated plates (Falcon) at a density of 105 cells per well. This plating system yields cell cultures that are more than 95% myocytes as determined by indirect staining with a monoclonal mouse antibody to desmin. Transient transfection experiments were performed in neonatal cardiomyocytes following 24 h in culture and the DNA precipitates were left for 16 h. The cells were then washed in 1 time in phosphate-buffered saline and the media was replaced by the above media containing reduced fetal calf serum at 1% (v/v) (hereafter referred to as growth medium) for an additional 24 h before experimentation. Within 3 days a confluent monolayer of spontaneously beating myocytes was formed. To subject the cells to simulated ischemia, the normal growth media of the cardiomyocyte cultures was replaced with 1 ml of ischemic buffer; 137 mm NaCl, 12 mm KCl, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2H2O, 4 mm HEPES, 20 mm Na lactate, 10 mmdeoxyglucose (Sigma, Dorset, United Kingdom) (pH 6.2) and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in an ischemic chamber for 4 h in an atmosphere of 0% oxygen, 5% CO2, balance gas argon (BOC gases). In some experiments cells exposed to simulated ischemia for 4 h were returned to a normoxic environment for a further 16 h or re-oxygenation to simulate reperfusion. In some cases cardiomyocytes were also treated for 16 h with IFN-γ (50 ng/ml) (Sigma) following transient transfection with the indicated reporter constructs. The MEK1 chemical inhibitor PD98095 and the p38 MAPK chemical inhibitor SB203580 were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). For the ex vivo studies, hearts were quickly removed and mounted in a Langendorff perfusion apparatus and perfused with an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer as previously described (23Marber M.S. Latchman D.S. Walker J.M. Yellon D.M. Circulation. 1993; 88: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The isolated hearts were subsequently exposed to 35 min of zero-flow global ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Thereafter treated hearts cross-sectioned from the base to the apex into slices which were either frozen directly for Western blot analysis or placed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in molten paraffin until immunofluorescent analysis. Cells were exposed to a 4-h ischemic insult as described above and harvested immediately or following 16 h of reoxygenation. Approximately 1 × 104cells were harvested in 100 µl of 2 times concentrated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Cardiac ventricular tissue (∼0.2 g) was homogenized in 0.2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, then after centrifugation the supernatant was removed and the cells transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were lysed by three 20-s bursts of sonication in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HCl, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) cooled on ice between each sonication. Tissue debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min 4 °C) and an equal volume of SDS buffer was added to the supernatant which was boiled for 3 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and subjected to Western blotting with specific antibodies against anti-phospho-STAT1Ser-727 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-STAT-1, anti-Fas, anti-FasL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-p38 and anti-p38 (New England BioLabs). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (24Scarabelli T.M. Stephanou A. Knight R.A. Rayment N.B. Cooper A. Brar B.K. Lawrence K.M. Santilli G. Latchman D.S. Baxter G.F. Yellon D.M. J. Immunol. Meth. 1999; 228: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular sections were dewaxed, deparaffined in xylene, and subsequently rehydrated with 100% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water. Sections were then pretreated in TBS containing 1 µg/ml trypsin, washed with TBS and incubated with anti-phospho-STAT1Ser-727 antibody (1:50) for 1 h followed by a further 1 h with either anti-Fas or anti-FasL antibody and subsequently with rhodamide or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody for a further 1 h. Sections were thoroughly washed in TBS and slides were mounted under glass coverslips using antifade mounting medium and examined by confocal fluorescent microscopy. For assessing the effects of STAT-1, STAT1–701, or STAT1–727 I/R-induced cell death in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes, 5 µg of expression vectors were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 2 µg of pCMV-β-galactosidase vector to mark the transfected cells by the calcium phosphate method. As assayed by this method ∼10–15% of cells were successfully transfected. 24 h following transfection, cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactopyranoside to test for β-galactosidase activity. TUNEL assays were also performed on the fixed cells. Percentage of apoptotic cells were determined by calculating the fraction of cells positive for both β-galactosidase and TUNEL as a fraction of total β-galactosidase positive cells. In all cases a total of ∼200 cells were counted per well. U3A cells transfected with wild-type STAT-1, STAT1–701, or STAT1–727 mutant were exposed to ischemia for 4 h, and cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell extracts were prepared for band shift assay with a STAT-1 SIEm67 DNA probe that serves as a binding site for STAT-1. Samples were also incubated with either a STAT-1 or STAT-3 antibody for 30 min prior to incubation with the DNA probe to determine the specificity of the complex. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments unless stated otherwise. Paired data were evaluated by Student's t test. A one-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. Our previous studies have demonstrated the enhanced expression and activation by phosphorylation on tyrosine 701 (via the JAK pathway) of the transcription factor STAT-1 in cardiomyocytes exposed to I/R (19Stephanou A. Brar B. Knight R.A. Marber M.S. Yellon D. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10002-10008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We also showed that the pro-apoptotic factor caspase-1 was one STAT-1 target gene involved in promoting the apoptosis effect of STAT-1 (19Stephanou A. Brar B. Knight R.A. Marber M.S. Yellon D. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10002-10008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the present study we assessed whether apoptosis induced by simulated I/R in cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes also induced the phosphorylation of STAT-1 on serine 727 mediated via the p42/44 or p38 MAPK pathway. As shown in Fig. 1, cardiac myocytes exposed to simulated ischemia alone showed enhanced STAT-1 Ser-727 phosphorylation as well as STAT-1 enhanced expression and the intensity of STAT-1 Ser-727 phosphorylation was increased further following subsequent re-oxygenation without any change in total STAT-1 level. Recently phosphorylation of STAT-1 at Ser-727 was shown to be dependent on the activation of p38 MAPK (25Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 26Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 27Stoiber D. Kovarik P. Cohney S. Johnston J.A. Steinlein P. Decker T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2640-2647PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we also examined the levels of active phosphorylated 38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes exposed to simulated ischemia or I/R. As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of cardiomyocytes to simulated ischemia showed enhanced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. However, the level of phospho-p38 MAPK reverted to undetectable control levels following I/R. The above data suggests that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK occurs as a rapid and acute response, while induction of phospho-STAT-1 Ser-727 is a progressive and sustained response to ischemia and I/R. We next determined whether the observed changes in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and STAT-1 Ser-727 in cardiomyocytes exposed to I/R correlated with changes in the levels of both Fas and FasL. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to simulated I/R induced the expression of Fas and FasL (Fig. 1). The induction of Fas and FasL was not observed in cardiomyocytes exposed to ischemia alone, suggesting a time-dependent response with the re-oxygenation/reperfusion phase required for maximal induction of Fas and FasL. Interestingly, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 attenuated the enhancement of both Fas and FasL protein levels exposed to I/R. Furthermore, the p38 inhibitor also abrogated the enhancement of STAT-1 Ser-727 phosphorylation (Fig.2). The above data demonstrate that both STAT-1 phosphorylation on Ser-727 and Fas/FasL are induced in cardiomyocytes exposed to I/R. Recently IFN-γ which results in STAT-1 Tyr-701 phosphorylation has been shown to modulate the protein levels of Fas and FasL in noncardiac cells (28Xu X. Fu X.Y. Plate J. Chong A.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2832-2837PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that STAT-1 may activate Fas/FasL in cardiac cells exposed to I/R. Therefore we performed studies to test whether theFas and FasL genes may also be modulated at the level of transcription by transfection experiments using Fas and FasL promoter luciferase reporter constructs in cardiac cells exposed to either IFN-γ or simulated I/R. IFN-γ increased the activity of both the Fas (Fig. 3a) and FasL (Fig. 3 b) promoters by 4- and 6-fold, respectively, over untreated cells. In addition, overexpression of STAT-1 together with IFN-γ treatment further enhanced the activity of Fas and FasL promoters by 8- and 10-fold, respectively (Fig. 3). Cardiac myocytes exposed to simulated I/R also showed transactivation of the Fas (Fig.3 a) and FasL (Fig. 3 b) promoters by 3- and 5-fold, respectively. Moreover, transfection of an antisense STAT-1 construct greatly reduced both the IFN-γ/STAT-1 and simulated I/R-induced activation of the Fas and FasL promoters (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the Fas and FasLgenes are target genes for STAT-1. In agreement with the analysis, both the Fas and FasL promoters reveal several potential STAT-1-binding sites. Recently it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of STAT-1 at Ser-727 by p38 MAPK is able to modulate STAT-1 signaling pathways (25Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 26Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 27Stoiber D. Kovarik P. Cohney S. Johnston J.A. Steinlein P. Decker T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2640-2647PubMed Google Scholar) STAT-1 Ser-727 has been shown to be a target for both ERK and p38 MAPKs, while STAT-1 Tyr-701 is a target for JAKs. Our previous study also demonstrated that STAT-1 enhanced the response to I/R-induced cell death (19Stephanou A. Brar B. Knight R.A. Marber M.S. Yellon D. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10002-10008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore in the present study we assessed the functional activity of two STAT-1 mutants in which Ser-727 had been mutated to alanine or Tyr-701 had been mutated to phenylalanine for their ability to modulate the activity of the Fas and FasL promoters. Each of these mutants was first transfected into STAT-1-deficient cells and treated with IFN-γ and cell extracts blotted with antibodies to total STAT-1 or STAT-1 phosphorylated on Ser-727 or Tyr-701. As shown in Fig.4a, the Phe-701 mutant was not phosphorylated on position 701 but was phosphorylated at position 727, whereas the Ala-727 mutant had the opposite pattern of phosphorylation when we tested the mutants. Moreover, in accordance with previous results (29Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P-Y. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2001; 19: 4111-4122Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar), both the wild-type and the two mutant forms of STAT-1 were able to bind to DNA in a DNA mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from the transfected STAT-1-deficient cells (Fig.4 b). In addition, this retarded band was abolished by an anti-STAT-1 antibody, but not anti-STAT-3 antibody, in nuclear extracts from STAT-1-deficient U3A cells exposed to ischemia, thus confirming it as STAT-1. Most interestingly, transfection of STAT1–727 mutant greatly reduced the activation of both Fas and FasL promoters compared with the wild-type STAT-1 in cardiac cells following exposure to either IFN-γ or simulated I/R. In contrast, STAT1–701 mutant had a similar effect to wild-type STAT-1 in activating the promoters of both Fas and FasL (Fig. 4, c and d). Thus, the STAT1–727 and not STAT1–701 phosphorylation site is important for mediating the enhancement of Fas and FasL promoter activity. This finding contrasts with previous reports (30Walter M.J. Look D.C. Tidwell R.M. Roswit W.T. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28582-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in which the STAT1–701 mutant behaved as a dominant negative mutant on a test promoter containing only a STAT-1 responsive element. As illustrated in Fig. 4 e, this was also the case in our hands with the STAT1–701 mutant inhibiting the ability of wild-type STAT-1 to activate an artificial promoter containing a STAT-1-binding site (Fig. 4 e). Hence, this clearly demonstrates that the effect of different STAT-1 mutants is different on different STAT-1 responsive genes. To investigate the possible role of the p38 MAPK in this effect pathway we repeated our transfection experiments in the presence or absence of co-transfected dominant negative dn-MEKK6, an upstream activator of p38 MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK via dn-MEKK6 reduced the level of activation of Fas and FasL promoter activity in cardiac cells exposed to simulated I/R (Fig. 5, aand b). Furthermore, addition of the chemical inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, also reduced the activation of Fas and FasL promoter activity following I/R (Fig. 5). Recently the other two major MAPK, JNK, and p42/p44 MAPK have also been shown to modulate the expression of Fas and FasL in non-cardiac cells (31Zhang J. Goa J.X. Salojin Q. Grattan M. Meager C. Laird D.W. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 751-763Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Accordingly we tested the effects of JNK and ERK MAPKs in modulating STAT-1- mediated transactivation of the Fas and FasL promoters in primary cardiomyocytes. As shown in Fig. 5, transfection of a dominant-negative JNK together with the STAT-1 expression vector reduced the level of activation of both the Fas and FasL promoters in cardiac cells exposed to simulated I/R. However, co-transfection of STAT-1 together with a dominant-negative MEK1 expression vector (the upstream activator of p42/p44), or pretreatment of cardiac cells with the specific MEK1 chemical inhibitor PD98059 in cardiac cells exposed to simulated I/R had no significant effect on the activation of either the Fas or FasL promoters following I/R (Fig. 5). These studies indicate that p38 and JNK but not the ERK1/ERK2 MAPKs are potential candidates for modulating STAT-1 activation of the Fas andFasL genes acting via the phosphorylation at Ser-727 of STAT-1. We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of STAT-1 induced apoptotic death in cardiac myocytes and overexpression of an antisense STAT-1 (to reduce endogenous levels of STAT-1) reduced cell death (19Stephanou A. Brar B. Knight R.A. Marber M.S. Yellon D. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10002-10008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated whether the two STAT-1 mutants STAT1–701 or STAT-727 can also modulate the levels of apoptotic death in cardiac myocytes following exposure to I/R. Overexpression of wild-type or STAT1–701 mutant enhanced the levels of apoptotic death in cardiac myocytes (Fig.6). However, overexpression STAT1–727 mutant in cardiac myocytes resulted in much lower levels of apoptotic cell death than those observed with either wild-type or the STAT1–701 mutant (Fig. 6). Thus, these results demonstrate that the STAT1–727 and not STAT1–701 phosphorylation site is critical not only for mediating the enhancement of Fas and FasLgene expression but also in promoting apoptosis following exposure to cardiac cells to I/R. Finally we examined whether ourin vitro data with cardiac cells on simulated I/R-induced Fas and FasL expression together with the induction of phospho-STAT-1 Ser-727 and phospho-p38 MAPK were also reproducible in the intact heart. Experiments were performed using 35-min coronary occlusion to produce ischemia in the intact heart ex vivo in a Langendorff perfusion system. After exposure to 35-min ischemia the hearts were reperfused for a further 2 h. The left ventricles were then removed and Western blotting performed to assess the levels of phospho-STAT Ser-727, phospho-p38 MAPK, Fas, and FasL. As shown in Fig.7, the levels of phospho-STAT Ser-727, phospho-p38 MAPK, Fas, and FasL all increased following I/R in the intact heart, whereas the total level of STAT-1 did not change. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining also demonstrated an increase in phospho-STAT-1 Ser-727 positive staining in ventricular tissue sections in response to ischemia/reperfusion which was accompanied by an increase in the number of Fas- and FasL-positive myocytes (TableI). In addition, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy also demonstrated cardiomyocyte staining positive for STAT-1 Ser-727 in the nucleus and Fas in the cytosplasm (Fig.8). A similar co-localized staining pattern was also seen with FasL and STAT-1 Ser-727 (data not shown). Thus, the increased levels of Fas and FasL during I/R may be the result of the transcriptional activation of STAT-1 translocated to the nucleus switching on both the Fas and FasL genes. Hence, these results further support a key role for STAT-1 in ischemia/reperfusion-induced cell death in the intact heart acting by inducing the expression of Fas and FasL.Table IProportion of cardiac myocytes positive for phopho-STAT1–727, Fas, and FasL labeling in ischemic reperfused rat heartSTAT-1FasLFasControl0.1%0.1%0.1%Ischemia (35′)26% ± 33.3% ± 14.9% ± 1I/R (35′ min + 60′ min)43% ± 527% ± 236% ± 4 Open table in a new tab Figure 8Section of ischemia-reperfused rat hearts showing nuclear staining (red) for the specific STAT1-Ser-727 antibody co-localized with cytoplasmic anti-Fas staining (green) (×63).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Fas/FasL system plays an important role in the regulation of physiological homeostasis in the immune system. In addition, the Fas/FasL system also participates in various types of stress-induced apoptosis. For example, exposure of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia enhances both Fas expression and cell death (8Tanaka M. Itoh H. Adachi S. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Furthermore, isolated hearts from mice lacking functional Fas display marked reduction in cell death following exposure to I/R compared with wild-type control hearts (33Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Bebatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the Fas/FasL system is important in modulating apoptosis in the heart following I/R. The molecular mechanisms regulating apoptosis via the Fas/FasL system have not yet been identified. The present study demonstrates that exposure of cardiac myocytes to I/R in vitro and in the intact heart ex vivo results in the induction of Fas and FasL expression via a STAT-1-dependent pathway. Overexpression of antisense STAT-1 vector in cardiac cells abrogated the enhancement of I/R-induced Fas and FasL promoter activity, while functional STAT-1 enhanced it. In turn, the STAT1–727 mutant, which is not phosphorylated on Ser-727, abrogated the I/R-induced promoter activation and enhanced protein levels of Fas and FasL, whereas the STAT1–701 mutant behaved in the same way as wild-type STAT-1. Similarly, overexpression of wild-type STAT-1 or the mutant STAT1–701 and not the STAT1–727 mutant enhanced apoptotic cell death in cardiac cells. We also demonstrate enhanced phosphorylation of both p38 MAPK and STAT-1 on Ser-727 and expression of Fas/FasL in the intact heart ex vivo exposed to I/R. This is paralleled by detection of activated phospho-Ser-727 STAT-1 co-localized with increased Fas and FasL positivity in cardiomyocytes in the intact heart exposed to I/R. Hence, these results demonstrate that the 727 phosphorylation site of STAT-1 is important in mediating cardiomyocyte-induced cell death by a mechanism involving the induction of Fas and its cognate ligand, whereas tyrosine 701 is not required. Tyrosine 701 has generally been regarded as critical for gene activation by STAT-1 and we showed that this is indeed the case on a test promoter containing a STAT-1-binding site. However, a recent study using gene arrays showed that mutation of this site has no effect on the STAT-1 inducibility of genes such as LMP2, while preventing the induction of other genes such as IRF1 (29Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P-Y. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2001; 19: 4111-4122Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our results support these findings indicating that the effect of this mutation is promoter specific and can still activate the Fas and FasL gene promoters. The transcriptional activity of STAT-1 dually phosphorylated on Ser-727 and Tyr-701 is greater than that of STAT-1 phosphorylated on Tyr-701 alone. Interestingly, several studies have shown various stresses including IFN-γ to induce phosphorylation of STAT-1 on Ser-727 via a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway in noncardiac cells (25Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 26Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the present study p38 activity appeared to be required for serine 727 phosphorylation of STAT-1 in cardiac myocytes in response to I/R. Furthermore, we show that the STAT-1 Ser-727 mutant is transcriptionally inactive in enhancing Fas and FasL promoters in cardiac myocytes exposed to I/R, whereas the STAT-1 Tyr-701 mutant retains full transcriptional activity. Hence, this suggests that in the heart, Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT-1 is also crucial for gene transactivation by STAT-1. In non-cardiac cells the MAPK pathways mediated by p38, JNK, and p42/p44 have been implicated in the regulation of Fas/FasL expression. For example, withdrawal of survival factors leads to activation of JNK pathway in neuronal cells resulting in FasL induction and cell death (32Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 751-763Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Similarly, stimulation of T cells leading to activation-induced cell death results in both p38 and JNK activation and is followed by the induction of FasL (31Zhang J. Goa J.X. Salojin Q. Grattan M. Meager C. Laird D.W. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1017-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). I/R injury to cardiac myocytes is associated with p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Inhibition of the p38 pathway reduced the level of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro and also in the intact heart ex vivo (35Makay K. Motchly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6272-6279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36Nakano A. Bains C.P. Kim S.O. Pelech S.L. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the present study, chemical and molecular inhibition of the p38 pathway abolished Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT-1 I/R-induced activation of the Fas and FasL promoters, suggesting that p38 MAPK activation is involved in STAT-1 Ser-727 phosphorylation and gene transactivation. JNK activation is also enhanced following ischemia and I/R (36Nakano A. Bains C.P. Kim S.O. Pelech S.L. Downey J.M. Cohen M.V. Critz S.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Sugden P.A. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the JNK pathway also reduced the level of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro (38He H. Li H-L. Gottlieb R.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative JNK expression vector also reduced I/R-induced Fas and FasL promoter activity. Thus, in addition to p38 MAPK, JNK also contributes to the modulation of Fas and FasL via the activation of STAT-1. In contrast, to the pro-apoptotic effects in the heart of p38 and JNK, the other stress-activated MAPK family p42/p44 (ERK1/ERK2) appears to be involved in cardiac cell survival. Factors which activate p42/p44, such as cardiotrophin-1 and urocortin, are cardioprotective both in vitro and ex vivo, and these protective effects are abolished by pretreatment with the p42/p44 pathway inhibitor, PD98059 (39Brar B.

(2001) Cardiovascular Res., in press.Google Scholar). Inhibition of p42/p44 in cardiac myocytes cultured under normoxic conditions did not increase the level of cell death, suggesting that p42/p44 is not required for cell survival in non-stressed conditions (39Brar B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8508-8514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 40Brar, B., Stephanou, A., Cai, Q., Pennica, D., Yellon, D., and Latchman, D. S. (2001) Cardiovascular Res., in press.Google Scholar). In the present study blocking p38/JNK but not the p42/p44 pathway inhibited I/R-induced Fas and FasL promoter activity. Hence, these studies together with our present study suggests that the p38/JNK but not the p42/p44 pathway may promote apoptosis in cardiac myocytes via the modulation of Fas and its cognate ligand, FasL which in turn is dependent on the phosphorylation of STAT-1 on Ser-727. Cardiac myocyte injury and death, at least in part by apoptosis, following I/R injury, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The present study reinforces our earlier work on the importance of STAT-1 in the induction of cardiac myocyte apoptosis and identifies the signaling pathways by which STAT-1 is activated during I/R in the heart as well as identifying the Fas and FasL genes as targets for STAT-1 in the heart. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the apoptotic program is initiated in the heart may lead to new therapeutic approaches for this common clinical problem."

To define the transcription factor responsible for pancreatic cell differentiation, we employed the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator system in INS-I cell-derived subclones INSrαβ and INSrβ to achieve tightly controlled and conditional expression of wild type Pdx1 or its dominant-negative mutant, as well as brain-4. INSrαβ cells express not only insulin but also glucagon and brain-4, while INSrβ cells express only insulin. Overexpression of Pdx1 eliminated glucagon mRNA and protein in INSrαβ cells and promoted the expression of β-cell-specific genes in INSrβ cells. Induction of dominant-negative Pdx1 in INSrαβ cells resulted in differentiation of insulin-producing β-cells into glucagon-containing α-cells without altering brain4 expression. Loss of Pdx1 function alone in INSrβ cells, which do not express endogenous brain-4 and glucagon, was also sufficient to abolish the expression of genes restricted to β-cells and to cause α-cell differentiation. In contrast, induction of brain-4 in INSrβ cells initiated detectable expression of glucagon but did not affect β-cell-specific gene expression. In conclusion, Pdx1 confers the expression of pancreatic β-cell-specific genes, such as genes encoding insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide, Glut2, and Nkx6.1.

Chem. 2000; 17: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and display differentiation plasticity, would be suitable for elucidating the function of transcription factors in islet cell differentiation. The present study was designed to define the role of Pdx1 and brain4 in the regulation of pancreatic cell lineage differentiation using INS-1-derived stable cell lines expressing Pdx1, its dominant-negative mutant (DN1-Pdx1), or brain4 under the control of the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (rtTA) (31Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). The established INS-1 subclones would also allow us to pinpoint the Pdx1-specific downstream target genes. The rat insulinoma INS-1 cell line-derived stable clones were cultured in RPMI 1640 in 11.2 mm glucose (30Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 17: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (171) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated. The first-step stable clones INSrαβ and INSrβ, which express the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator, were reported previously as INS-r3 and INS-r9, respectively (32Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Plasmids used in the secondary stable transfection were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs encoding the mouse Pdx1 (kindly supplied by Dr. H. Edlund, Umea, Sweden), its dominant-negative mutant (DN-Pdx1), and the rat brain4 into the expression vector PUHD10–3 (a kind gift from Dr. H. Bujard). DN-Pdx1 (truncated mutation lacking the first 79 amino acids) was PCR-amplified from Pdx1 using the following primers: 5′-gcaggatccgctcacctccaccaccaccttccagct-3′ and 5′-ggcagatctggccattagcttggcatcagaagc-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into modified pcDNA3.1myc (Invitrogene) and sequenced. The rat brain4 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from freshly isolated rat islets and the following primers: 5′-gaccatggccacagctgcctc-3′ and 5′-tgcagcgggccacctccttg-3′. The PCR product was inserted into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega/Catalys) according to the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced. The stable transfection and the clone selection and screening procedures were described previously (32Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting procedures were performed as described previously using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) for detection (30Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 17: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The dilution for antibody against Pdx1 C terminus (a kind gift from Dr. H. Edlund) was 1:5,000. For immunofluorescence cells were grown on polyornithine-treated glass coverslips for 1 day prior to 4 days of treatment with 500 ng/ml doxycycline. The cells were then washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The preparation was then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin before incubating with the first antibodies mouse monoclonal anti-human insulin (1:1,000 dilution; from Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal anti-porcine glucagon (1:2,500 dilution) (33Trimble E.R. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Renold A.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), followed by the second antibody labeling. The resultant immunofluorescence was viewed using a Zeiss laser scan confocal 410 microscope (Zurich, Switzerland). Nuclear extracts from INS-1 cells grown in culture medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h and from BHK-21 cells transfected with various expression plasmids were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes: the rat insulin I FLAT element 5′-GATCTTGTTAATAATCTAATTACC-3′ (35German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and the rat glucagon G1 element (37Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). EMSA procedures including conditions for probe labeling, binding reactions, unlabeled probe competition, and antibody supershift were performed as previously reported (37Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies raised against Pdx1 and Pax-6 were generously provided by H. Edlund and S. Saule, respectively. Cells in 10-cm diameter dishes were cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h at 2.5, 6, 12, and 24 mm glucose. After washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were suspended and allowed to swell for 15 min at 4 °C in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 3 cycles of freeze-thaw, the cytosolic proteins (supernatant) were separated from the nuclear fraction (pellet) by centrifugation. The nuclear proteins were further isolated from the pellet according to Schreiber et al.(34Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4221-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cells in 10-cm diameter dishes were cultured in normal (11.2 mm) glucose medium with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for the indicated times, followed by an additional 8 h in culture medium with 2.5, 6, 12, and 24 mm glucose. Total RNA was extracted and blotted to nylon membranes as described previously (32Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The membrane was prehybridized and then hybridized to 32P-labeled random primer cDNA probes as previously described (38Wang H. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4257-4264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure equal RNA loading and even transfer, all membranes were stripped and rehybridized with “house-keeping gene” probes such as β-actin or cyclophilin. cDNA fragments used as probes for glucokinase, Glut2, insulin, Pdx1, and brain4 mRNA detection were digested from corresponding plasmids. cDNA probes for rat islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), somatostatin, glucagon, Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2, Pax4, Pax6, Isl1, and β2/NeuroD were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. Transient transfection experiments and luciferase reporter enzyme assays were carried out as previously reported (39Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overexpress transcription factors for EMSA, non-islet Syrian baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation using 10 μg of expression plasmids encoding quail Pax6 (S. Saule, Institut Curie, Paris, France), hamster Cdx-2/3 (M. S. German, University of California, San Francisco, CA), and mouse Pdx1 or DN-Pdx1. Cells in 24-well dishes were cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 4 days. The content of insulin and glucagon was determined after extraction with acid ethanol or 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 6 milliunits/ml aprotinin, respectively, following the procedures of Wang et al. (39Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin was detected by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard (39Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and glucagon was measured with a glucagon assay kit (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Cells in 24-well dishes were cultured for 2 days in INS-1 medium followed by 5 h of equilibration in 2.5 mm medium. Insulin secretion was measured in the presence of 2.5, 6, 12, or 24 mm glucose using Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer as previously described (39Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rat insulinoma INS-1 cells were used as the parental line for stable transfection of an expression plasmid encoding the rtTA (31Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 32Wang H. Iynedjian P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A clone termed INSrβ, which maintains the INS-1 β-cell phenotype, and another clone called INSrαβ, which represents a hybrid of α- and β-cells, were used for the present study. As shown in Fig. 1, INS-rβ and INS-1 cells express predominantly the β-cell-specific markers insulin and IAPP. In contrast, INSrαβ cells express not only insulin and IAPP but also glucagon and brain4 (Fig. 1). Somatostatin mRNA was abundantly expressed in freshly isolated islets but not detected in parental INS-1 cells or derived clones (Fig. 1). Pdx1 mRNA was present in both INSrβ and INSrαβ lines (Fig. 1). To study whether the production of glucagon in INSrαβ cells is correlated with the expression of brain4, we generated an INSrβ-derived stable cell line expressing brain4 in a doxycycline-inducible manner. The cDNA encoding brain4 was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA from freshly isolated rat islets, cloned into pGEM-T vector, and sequenced. To delineate the Pdx1-specific target genes and the Pdx1-regulated islet cell lineage differentiation, we also established both INSrβ- and INSrαβ-derived stable clones expressing Pdx1 or DN-Pdx1 under the control of rtTA. DN-Pdx1 represents the epitope Myc-tagged truncated Pdx1 mutant protein lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain (the first 79 amino acids) (40Peshavaria M. Henderson E. Sharma A. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The clones, named rβ-brain4-119, rβ-Pdx1-6, rβ-DN-Pdx1-28, rαβ-Pdx1-21, and rαβ-DN-Pdx1-59, which expressed the transgenes at the highest level after induction and showed only background expression under non-induced conditions, were selected for the present study. It has been reported that glucose stimulates translocation of Pdx1 from the cytoplasm or nuclear periphery to the nucleus in human islets and MIN6 cells (41Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M.

Docherty K. J. Biol.

(42Rafiq I. da Silva Xavier G. Hooper S. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15977-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported no such change. We investigated the intracellular location of both endogenous Pdx1 and induced Pdx1 using cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions prepared from rαβ-Pdx1-21 cells incubated in 2.5, 6, 12, and 24 mmglucose, respectively, for 24 h (Fig.2A). The majority of Pdx1 protein was present in the cytosolic fraction when rαβ-Pdx1-21 cells were maintained at 2.5 mm extracellular glucose concentration; however, in 6 mm glucose, Pdx1 predominantly translocated to the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using the rβ-Pdx1-6 line (data not shown). The 31-kDa form of Pdx1 described by Macfarlane et al. (41Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Cragg H. James R.F.L. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was not detected by Western blotting of the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.2A) or whole cell extracts (data not shown) from the INS-1-derived clones. Nevertheless, the endogenous Pdx1 protein in Min6-m9 cells (44Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.-Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a glucose-dependent manner but did not change molecular mass (Fig. 2B). However, there is a clear difference in glucose responsiveness in INS-1-derived cells compared with MIN6-m9 cells, because Pdx1 translocation was maximally stimulated at glucose concentrations between 2.5 and 6 mm in INS-1-derived clones (Fig. 2A), whereas glucose-regulated Pdx1 translocation occurred over the full range from 2.5 to 24 mm glucose in MIN6-m9 cells (Fig. 2B). The induced DN-Pdx1 mutant protein lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain translocated in a way similar to endogenous Pdx1 in both rαβ-DN-Pdx1-59 (Fig.2C) and rβ-DN-Pdx1-28 (Fig. 2D) cells, in agreement with the identification of the nuclear localization signal in the Pdx1 homeodomain (45Hessabi B. Ziegler P. Schmidt I. Hessabi C. Walther R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the glucose responsiveness, in terms of both Pdx1 translocation and insulin secretion in INSrαβ-derived cells, was equivalent to that in INSrβ-derived cells (Fig. 2, A,C, and D and TableI). The right shift of the glucose-induced Pdx1 translocation in MIN6-m9 cells (Fig.2B) corresponds to the right shift of the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in these cells (44Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.-Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) relative to INS-1-derived cells (Fig. 2, A, C, and D and TableI). Thus, half-maximal insulin secretion in MIN6-m9 cells was observed at 15 mm glucose (44Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.-Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the value is 6 mm in the INS-1-derived clones (Table I). Whether or not there is a direct correlation between the glucose-induced Pdx1 translocation and the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion remains to be established.Table IGlucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INSrαβ- and INSrβ-derived clonesGlucoserαβ-DN-Pdx1-59rβ-Pdx1-6mm2.50.117 ± 0.0140.311 ± 0.09760.215 ± 0.0340.581 ± 0.090120.376 ± 0.0340.808 ± 0.271240.423 ± 0.08390.894 ± 0.203The amount of insulin released over 30 min from INSrαβ-derived rαβ-DN-Pdx1-59 clone and INSrβ-derived rβ-Pdx1-6 clone is presented as percent of insulin content.

Data from six independent experiments are shown as means ± S.E. Quantitative Northern blotting was employed to study the impact of induction of Pdx1 on the expression of INS-1 mRNAs at extracellular glucose concentrations of 2.5, 6, 12, and 24 mm. As demonstrated in Fig.3A, glucagon mRNA expression in INSrαβ cells was no longer detectable after induction of Pdx1 for 48 h, whereas brain4 mRNA remained constant. Overexpression of Pdx1 in rαβ-Pdx1-21 cells slightly raised the mRNA level of Nkx6.1 but had no significant effect on the mRNA expression of Nkx2.2, Pax4, Pax6, Isl1, and β2/NeuroD (Fig.1A). We also performed EMSA experiments with a probe corresponding to the rat insulin I FLAT element, which contains the Pdx1-binding site (35German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Using nuclear extracts from rαβ-Pdx1-21 cells cultured with or without 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 24 h, we found that induction of Pdx1 resulted in a dramatic increase (>20-fold) in its binding activity to the rat insulin promoter (data not shown). Unexpectedly, we did not see a concomitant rise in the mRNA levels of insulin or IAPP (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the insulin content in rαβ-Pdx1-21 cells was increased by more than 2-fold (−Dox, 33.65 ± 1.37 ng/mg or protein versus +Dox, 74.55 ± 17.23 ng/mg of protein; p < 0.005) after 4 days induction of Pdx1, despite the fact that the insulin mRNA was reduced by 32.6% under the same condition. In contrast, the glucagon content in rαβ-Pdx1-21 cells dropped by 94% (−Dox, 8.09 ± 1.51 ng/mg of protein versus +Dox, 0.48 ± 0.11 ng/mg of protein;p < 0.001) after induction of Pdx1 for 4 days. Consistently, the immunofluorescence double staining of rαβ-Pdx1-21 cells showed that the glucagon expression was no longer detectable, whereas the insulin level was concomitantly increased after doxycycline induction for 4 days (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, the graded overexpression of Pdx1 in rβ-Pdx1-6 cells caused a stepwise increase in the expression of Nkx6.1 mRNA. The expression of another β-cell-specific marker, Glut2, was also slightly increased by induction of Pdx1 (Fig.3C). Overexpression of Pdx1 alone is not sufficient to raise the endogenous insulin and IAPP mRNA levels (Fig. 3C). However, overexpression of Pdx1 may facilitate the biosynthesis of insulin or the formation (or maturation) of insulin granules, because doxycycline treatment for 4 days also significantly increased the insulin content in rβ-Pdx1-6 cells without altering insulin m"

IRAG is present in a macromolecular complex with the InsP3 receptor type I (InsP3RI) and cGKIβ. The specificity of the interaction between these three proteins was investigated by using the yeast two-hybrid system and by co-precipitation of expressed proteins. The amino-terminal region containing the leucine zipper (amino acids 1–53) of cGKIβ but not that of cGKIα or cGKII interacted with the sequence between amino acids 152 and 184 of IRAG in vitroand in vivo most likely through electrostatic interaction. cGKIβ did not interact with the InsP3RI, but co-precipitated the InsP3RI in the presence of IRAG indicating that IRAG bound to the InsP3RI and to cGKIβ. cGKIβ phosphorylated up to four serines in IRAG. Mutation of these four serines to alanine showed that cGKIβ-dependent phosphorylation of Ser696 is necessary to decrease calcium release from InsP3-sensitive stores.

The observed perinuclear localization of heterologously expressed IRAG suggested the potential role of IRAG as a modulator of calcium release from intracellular stores. Indeed, functional studies revealed that IRAG inhibits InsP3-induced calcium release after activation of cGKIβ with 8-pCPT-cGMP in COS-7 cells (9Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A.

However, the precise mechanism by which IRAG influences calcium release is still unknown.In the present study we investigated the molecular determinants for the interaction of IRAG and cGKI. It is shown that IRAG interacts specifically with the amino-terminal region containing the leucine zipper of cGKIβ. Phosphorylation of Ser696 of IRAG is essential for the inhibition of InsP3-induced calcium release.DISCUSSIONcGK has been implicated in various physiological signal transduction pathways leading to relaxation of smooth muscle, inhibition of platelet aggregation, cell motility and cell proliferation, secretion of intestinal fluid, bone growth, renin secretion, guidance of nerve fibers, and the development of synaptic plasticity (1Francis S.H.

Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). IRAG was co-purified together with InsP3R and cGKIβ. In this study, we show that IRAG interacts only with the amino-terminal region containing the leucine zipper of cGKIβ and not with that of cGKIα or cGKII. The IRAG sequence interacting with the amino-terminal region containing the leucine zipper of cGKIβ does not contain a phosphorylation site supporting the notion that interaction between cGKIβ and IRAG is independent of the mechanism allowing substrate binding. This interaction does not require activation of the kinase domain and should be stable in relaxed and contracted cells. Localization of cGKIβ to IRAG explains the observed phosphorylation specificity for the Iβ isozyme and the inability of cGKIα to modify IRAG.The results of this study contribute to earlier observations that cGMP kinases recognize their in vivo substrates by interaction of amino-terminal kinase sequences with the substrate protein. This mechanism has been identified not only for the co-localization of cGKIβ and IRAG, but was found also with cGKII and cGKIα. Myristoylation of the first glycine of cGKII is required for membrane localization of the enzyme and the phosphorylation of CFTR (34Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Tilly B.C. Houtsmuller A.B.

Furthermore, it has been shown that cGKIα binds with its unique amino-terminal leucine zipper to the myosin binding subunit of phosphatase I (38Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4897-4905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In each case it appears that the kinase binds to a substrate sequence that is outside the phosphorylation site. The permanent localization of the kinase to its substrate allows a rapid response after increases in cGMP. In comparison to the cAMP kinase system it is obvious that the subcellular organization of the cGMP kinases does not require extra anchoring proteins as necessary for the cAMP kinase signaling system (43Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).IRAG, cGKIβ, and the InsP3RI could be co-purified together, whereas cGKIβ and InsP3RI were not co-precipitated and did not interact in the two-hybrid screen. It is therefore plausible to assume that the assembly of the triple complex required expression of IRAG. In support of this hypothesis is the finding that the InsP3RI phosphorylation was evident only when cGKIβ was coexpressed with the InsP3RI. The differential possibility of cGKI to phosphorylate the InsP3RI is in good agreement with previous in vivo findings. cGKI phosphorylated in vivo the smooth muscle InsP3RI (24Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21933-21938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and affected calcium release in megakaryocytes (17Tertyshnikova S. Yan X. Fein A. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1998; 512.1: 89-96Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is not in contrast to the above results, since smooth muscle and platelets express high levels of cGKIβ and IRAG which apparently allows cGKIβ-dependent phosphorylation of IRAG and the InsP3RI. Possibly, additional substrates exist for cGKIβ in smooth muscle since ∼50% of cGKIβ immunreactivity has been found in the cytosolic fraction (44Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of the InsP3RI by cGKIβ apparently did not contribute to the decrease in calcium release. This effect depended on the phosphorylation of Ser696 of IRAG. Mutation of Ser696 to alanine abolished complete the modulatory effect of cGKIβ on calcium release without disruption of the triple complex. The phosphorylation of the InsP3RI by cAMP kinase may be important to modulate the calcium release in vivo (45Tertyshnikova S. Fein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and may be an independent possibility to regulate smooth muscle contractility. Additional experiments are necessary to clarify whether or not cAMP kinase modulates smooth muscle contraction via phosphorylation of the InsP3R and requires the presence of IRAG. It is quite possible that modulation of the InsP3-dependent calcium release is specifically caused by cGKIβ, since cAMP analogs were unable to modulate the calcium release in murine aortic wild type and cGKI negative smooth muscle cells (8Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiß C. Wang G. Korth M. Aszódi A. Andersson E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fässler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).Together with the functional data obtained by intracellular calcium measurements our results clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser696 is indispensable for the inhibitory effect of IRAG and cGKI on InsP3-induced calcium release. The data presented here add a further functional element how the NO/cGMP/cGKI signaling pathway is involved in calcium regulation. With the identification of the functional phosphorylation site of the cGKIβ substrate protein IRAG we threw more light on the molecular mechanism by which cGKI inhibits InsP3-dependent calcium release in smooth muscle. Subsequent work must aim to elucidate the role of InsP3R in this process more precisely. Signal transduction via NO/cGMP/cGKI1 is involved in a variety of cellular mechanisms including smooth muscle contractility and platelet aggregation (1Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv.

Recently, we identified a 125-kDa cGKI substrate protein which was designated as inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate receptor-associated cGMP kinase substrate (IRAG). IRAG which is phosphorylated by cGKI is associated in a macromolecular complex with cGKIβ and InsP3RI in smooth muscle (9Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.X.

In comparison to the cAMP kinase system it is obvious that the subcellular organization of the cGMP kinases does not require extra anchoring proteins as necessary for the cAMP kinase signaling system (43Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).IRAG, cGKIβ, and the InsP3RI could be co-purified together, whereas cGKIβ and InsP3RI were not co-precipitated and did not interact in the two-hybrid screen. It is therefore plausible to assume that the assembly of the triple complex required expression of IRAG. In support of this hypothesis is the finding that the InsP3RI phosphorylation was evident only when cGKIβ was coexpressed with the InsP3RI. The differential possibility of cGKI to phosphorylate the InsP3RI is in good agreement with previous in vivo findings. cGKI phosphorylated in vivo the smooth muscle InsP3RI (24Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21933-21938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and affected calcium release in megakaryocytes (17Tertyshnikova S. Yan X. Fein A. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1998; 512.1: 89-96Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is not in contrast to the above results, since smooth muscle and platelets express high levels of cGKIβ and IRAG which apparently allows cGKIβ-dependent phosphorylation of IRAG and the InsP3RI. Possibly, additional substrates exist for cGKIβ in smooth muscle since ∼50% of cGKIβ immunreactivity has been found in the cytosolic fraction (44Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of the InsP3RI by cGKIβ apparently did not contribute to the decrease in calcium release. This effect depended on the phosphorylation of Ser696 of IRAG. Mutation of Ser696 to alanine abolished complete the modulatory effect of cGKIβ on calcium release without disruption of the triple complex. The phosphorylation of the InsP3RI by cAMP kinase may be important to modulate the calcium release in vivo (45Tertyshnikova S. Fein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and may be an independent possibility to regulate smooth muscle contractility. Additional experiments are necessary to clarify whether or not cAMP kinase modulates smooth muscle contraction via phosphorylation of the InsP3R and requires the presence of IRAG. It is quite possible that modulation of the InsP3-dependent calcium release is specifically caused by cGKIβ, since cAMP analogs were unable to modulate the calcium release in murine aortic wild type and cGKI negative smooth muscle cells (8Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiß C. Wang G. Korth M. Aszódi A. Andersson E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fässler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).Together with the functional data obtained by intracellular calcium measurements our results clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser696 is indispensable for the inhibitory effect of IRAG and cGKI on InsP3-induced calcium release. The data presented here add a further functional element how the NO/cGMP/cGKI signaling pathway is involved in calcium regulation. With the identification of the functional phosphorylation site of the cGKIβ substrate protein IRAG we threw more light on the molecular mechanism by which cGKI inhibits InsP3-dependent calcium release in smooth muscle. Subsequent work must aim to elucidate the role of InsP3R in this process more precisely. cGK has been implicated in various physiological signal transduction pathways leading to relaxation of smooth muscle, inhibition of platelet aggregation, cell motility and cell proliferation, secretion of intestinal fluid, bone growth, renin secretion, guidance of nerve fibers, and the development of synaptic plasticity (1Francis S.H.

IRAG has been identified recently as the substrate for cGKI that mediates cGMP-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle by decreasing the calcium release from InsP3-sensitive stores (9Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). IRAG was co-purified together with InsP3R and cGKIβ. In this study, we show that IRAG interacts only with the amino-terminal region containing the leucine zipper of cGKIβ and not with that of cGKIα or cGKII. The IRAG sequence interacting with the amino-terminal region containing the leucine zipper of cGKIβ does not contain a phosphorylation site supporting the notion that interaction between cGKIβ and IRAG is independent of the mechanism allowing substrate binding. This interaction does not require activation of the kinase domain and should be stable in relaxed and contracted cells. Localization of cGKIβ to IRAG explains the observed phosphorylation specificity for the Iβ isozyme and the inability of cGKIα to modify IRAG. The results of this study contribute to earlier observations that cGMP kinases recognize their in vivo substrates by interaction of amino-terminal kinase sequences with the substrate protein. This mechanism has been identified not only for the co-localization of cGKIβ and IRAG, but was found also with cGKII and cGKIα. Myristoylation of the first glycine of cGKII is required for membrane localization of the enzyme and the phosphorylation of CFTR (34Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Tilly B.C. Houtsmuller A.B.

Its proEMAPII precursor proved to be identical to the auxiliary p43 component of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. We show here that the EMAPII domain of p43 is released readily from the complex after in vitro digestion with caspase 7 and is able to induce migration of human mononuclear phagocytes. The N terminus ofin vitro-processed EMAPII coincides exactly with that of the mature cytokine isolated from conditioned medium of fibrosarcoma cells. We also show that p43/proEMAPII has a strong tRNA binding capacity (KD = 0.2 μm) as compared with its isolated N or C domains (7.5 μm and 40 μm, respectively). The potent general RNA binding capacity ascribed to p43/proEMAPII is lost upon the release of the EMAPII domain. This suggests that after onset of apoptosis, the first consequence of the cleavage of p43 is to limit the availability of tRNA for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases associated within the complex. Translation arrest is accompanied by the release of the EMAPII cytokine that plays a role in the engulfment of apoptotic cells by attracting phagocytes.

The endothelial-monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAPII) has been isolated from methylcholanthrene A-induced fibrosarcoma cells. EMAPII is a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates chemotactic migration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes and induces tissue factor activity on endothelial cells. The C-terminal domain of human or bovine TyrRS, which is related to EMAPII, displays identical cytokine activities (16Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 17Kornelyuk A. Tas M.P.R. Dubrovsky A. Murray J.C. Biopolym. Cell. 1999; 15: 168-172Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). EMAPII is expressed constitutively in all cell types as a ∼35-kDa precursor and is further processed to an ∼18-kDa mature form upon onset of apoptosis (18Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A.

Murray J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its maturation under apoptotic conditions, the precursor polypeptide obtained by in vitro transcription was shown to be a substrate for apoptotic proteases of the caspase family (20Behrensdorf H.A. van de Craen M. Knies U.E. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Because the p43 component of the multisynthetase complex is identical to proEMAPII, we wondered whether EMAPII could be processed from its complex-associated precursor. To address the consequences of p43 cleavage, we equally considered its involvement as a general RNA binding domain or as a cytokine. The results provide strong evidence for a dual role of p43 that can be identified with a molecular fuse. The function of p43 as a cofactor of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is lost upon cleavage and release of EMAPII, its C-domain with cytokine activity. Because proEMAPII is p43, a protein involved in translation and therefore ubiquitous to all cell types and tissues, previous reports dealing with the relative abundance of EMAPII mRNA or protein should be considered cautiously. They address, as well, the level of p43 in those tissues where active protein synthesis is required for tissue remodeling.DISCUSSIONHere we showed that the p43 component of the mammalian multisynthetase complex is a substrate for caspase 7, an apoptotic protease. The free recombinant, as well as the natural complex-associated p43 species, are substrates of caspase 7. However, we found that the p43 entity associated within the complex was more efficiently processed into EMAPII than its soluble form. This result suggests that the site of cleavage is made more accessible to the caspase when p43 is forced into a conformation suited for its association with the other components of the complex. Although the EEVD sequence at position 175 to 178 of murine p43 would be an ideal site for caspase 7 according to its known preferred peptide substrates (31Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar) the 141ASTD↓S145 sequence is usedin vitro by caspase 7 (this study), and the N terminus of the in vivo-generated EMAPII product also starts at residue Ser145 (14Kao J. Ryan J. Brett G. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.G. Godman G. Familletti P.C. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Stern D. Clauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20239-20247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported the crystal structure of human EMAPII (7Renault L. Kerjan P. Pasqualato S. Menetrey J. Robinson J.C. Kawaguchi S. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Mirande M. Cherfils J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Its two-domain architecture builds a pseudodimer. The 100-amino acid residue N-terminal domain forms an open β-barrel related to the 60-amino acid residue C-terminal domain by a degenerated 2-fold symmetry. The EEVD peptide belongs to strand β1 that forms the first strand of the oligonucleotide-oligosaccharide binding fold β-barrel domain. This tetrapeptide appears to be buried in the protein core and is therefore not accessible for recognition by caspase. In contrast, the released Ser145 at the N terminus is protruding from the compact structure.Following cleavage at the 141ASTD↓S145 site, the EMAPII cytokine lost its propensity to associate with the complex and is released as a monomer. The N terminus of p43 remains bound to the complex. These results are in full agreement with our previous analysis of protein-protein interactions involved in the assembly of the complex. We showed by a two-hybrid analysis that p43 is able to interact with p38, the scaffold component of the complex, but also with GlnRS and ArgRS (2Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the isolated N-terminal moiety of p43 associates with ArgRS, but its C-terminal region corresponding to EMAPII does not (3Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, p43 binds to p38 via its N-terminal domain. 2J. C. Robinson and M. Mirande, unpublished results. Thus, we anticipated that the release of EMAPII would not destabilize the quaternary structure of the complex.Examination of each of the components of the complex after caspase treatment revealed that, with the exception of ProRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases remain associated. ProRS is carried by a multifunctional polypeptide (32Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) containing an N-terminal domain corresponding to GluRS, a linker region made of repeated units with nonspecific RNA binding properties (33Cahuzac B. Berthonneau E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal ProRS domain. Cleavage of the GluProRS polypeptide by uncontrolled proteolysis led to the release of ProRS from the complex (30Kerjan P. Triconnet M. Waller J.P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because of the size of the GluRS (105 kDa) and ProRS (60 kDa) polypeptides observed after cleavage by caspase, the finding that antibodies raised against the repeated units selectively recognized the N-terminal GluRS polypeptide of 105 kDa, and the known consensus sequence for caspase 7, the aspartate residue at position 857 from the sequence 854DQVD857 of human GluProRS is likely to correspond to the cleavage site (Fig.8). AspRS and LysRS are also subjected to proteolysis, but their activities are not affected. The short polypeptides removed after cleavage by caspase 7 are therefore likely to be located at the N terminus of the two proteins, position corresponding to the eukaryotic-specific sequences that characterize the mammalian enzymes. According to the crystal structure of yeast AspRS (34Cavarelli J. Eriani G. Rees B. Ruff M. Boeglin M. Mitschler A. Martin F. Gangloff J. Thierry J.C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and of E. coli LysRS (35Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the removal of a short polypeptide at the C-terminal extremity of the two proteins should result in their inactivation. Indeed, the conserved motif 3 of class IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is located at the very C terminus of these proteins. The potential cleavage sites for caspase 7 are indicated in Fig. 8.Of particular interest is the finding that the immediate consequence of the cleavage of p43 into two equal moieties is the loss of its tRNA binding ability. The isolated domains have a weak RNA binding capacity (KD = ∼7.5–40 μm), even though the N-terminal domain is very rich in basic residues and displays a calculated pI > 9. EMAPII-like polypeptides are recurrent domains associated with various proteins. In yeast, the Arc1p protein associates with MetRS and GluRS and acts as a cofactor for tRNA delivery to the synthetase (12Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A polybasic sequence from the N-terminal region appended to the EMAPII-like domain of Arc1p is also required for efficient RNA binding. In plants, an EMAPII-like domain is appended at the C terminus of MetRS and synergizes with the MetRS domain for binding tRNA (8Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, EMAPII domains always require additional sequences to potentiate their interaction with tRNA molecules.It is worth noting that besides p43, the other targets of caspase 7 in the complex also concern peptide appendices that are eukaryote-specific and/or that are known to contribute RNA binding domains. The DQVD sequence that might be the caspase 7 recognition site in GluProRS is located in the third of the repeated units that form the linker polypeptide between the GluRS and ProRS domains. We recently determined that in human MetRS, an enzyme that possesses a single of these repeats, this polypeptide extension provides the MetRS core domain with a higher catalytic efficiency for tRNA aminoacylation. 3M. Kaminska and M. Mirande, submitted for publication. Similarly, the N-terminal polypeptide extension of human LysRS contributes an RNA binding domain that facilitates tRNA aminoacylation. 4M. Francin and M. Mirande, unpublished results. Consequently, in vivo processing of components of the multisynthetase complex by caspase 7 would have as an immediate consequence to restrict the availability of aminoacylated tRNAs and should result in the inhibition of protein synthesis. Following onset of apoptosis, cleavage of p43 and of other components of the complex would be a means to arrest translation in cells engaged in programmed cell death. Although other factors of the translation machinery, including eIF2α (36Marissen W.E. Guo Y. Thomas A.A. Matts R.L. Lloyd R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9314-9323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and eIF4G (37Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), are cleaved by caspase 3 during inhibition of translation in apoptotic cells, their proteolytic products do not possess cytokine activity. Secretion of EMAPII, the C-terminal domain of p43, results in the recruitment of macrophages (14Kao J. Ryan J. Brett G. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.G. Godman G. Familletti P.C. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Stern D.

GLIA. 1997; 20: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that engulf apoptotic cells, thus preventing inflammation caused by the release of their cellular content because of secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells. In this regard, p43 may compare with a molecular fuse. In its native pro-EMAPII form, it is an important cofactor for aminoacylation. After the fuse has blown, translation is irreversibly switched off, and EMAPII enters the cell death signaling pathway. In vitro assays showed that full-length recombinant p43 is also a potent cytokine (17Kornelyuk A. Tas M.P.R. Dubrovsky A. Murray J.C. Biopolym. Cell. 1999; 15: 168-172Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar,19Barnett G. Jakobsen A.M. Tas M. Rice K. Carmichael J. Murray J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). 5Unpublished results. This suggests that association of p43 within the multisynthetase complex inhibits its cytokine activity and/or sequesters proEMAPII in a cellular compartment and prevents its entry into apoptotic pathways until it is cleaved off the complex. Only a processed form of p43 is recovered in the supernatant of apoptotic cells. 6V. Shalak and M. Mirande, unpublished results. The pathway of EMAPII secretion remains to be deciphered. In higher eukaryotic organisms, from Drosophila to mammals, the nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for amino acids Glu, Pro, Ile, Leu, Met, Gln, Lys, Arg, and Asp are associated within a multienzyme complex containing three auxiliary proteins, as well (1Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The p38 auxiliary component contributes a scaffold protein for the assembly of the complex (2Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The p18 subunit of the complex might be an anchor for transient association of elongation factor EF-1H (4Quevillon S. Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The p43 subunit is an RNA-binding protein (5Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) based on a classical oligonucleotide-oligosaccharide binding fold (6Kim Y. Shin J. Li R. Cheong C.

Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whereas the p18 and p38 proteins are always recovered as components of the multisynthetase complex, p43 or p43-like domains are widespread in evolution and distributed in the three kingdoms of the tree of life. They have been described as polypeptide appendices of MetRS1 (8Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M.

Unexpectedly, a human protein homologous to the C-terminal moiety of hamster p43 was reported to have cytokine activities (14Kao J. Ryan J. Brett G. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.G. Godman G. Familletti P.C.

The endothelial-monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAPII) has been isolated from methylcholanthrene A-induced fibrosarcoma cells. EMAPII is a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates chemotactic migration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes and induces tissue factor activity on endothelial cells. The C-terminal domain of human or bovine TyrRS, which is related to EMAPII, displays identical cytokine activities (16Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 17Kornelyuk A. Tas M.P.R. Dubrovsky A. Murray J.C. Biopolym. Cell. 1999; 15: 168-172Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). EMAPII is expressed constitutively in all cell types as a ∼35-kDa precursor and is further processed to an ∼18-kDa mature form upon onset of apoptosis (18Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Barnett G. Jakobsen A.M. Tas M. Rice K. Carmichael J. Murray J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its maturation under apoptotic conditions, the precursor polypeptide obtained by in vitro transcription was shown to be a substrate for apoptotic proteases of the caspase family (20Behrensdorf H.A. van de Craen M. Knies U.E. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the p43 component of the multisynthetase complex is identical to proEMAPII, we wondered whether EMAPII could be processed from its complex-associated precursor. To address the consequences of p43 cleavage, we equally considered its involvement as a general RNA binding domain or as a cytokine. The results provide strong evidence for a dual role of p43 that can be identified with a molecular fuse. The function of p43 as a cofactor of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is lost upon cleavage and release of EMAPII, its C-domain with cytokine activity. Because proEMAPII is p43, a protein involved in translation and therefore ubiquitous to all cell types and tissues, previous reports dealing with the relative abundance of EMAPII mRNA or protein should be considered cautiously. They address, as well, the level of p43 in those tissues where active protein synthesis is required for tissue remodeling. DISCUSSIONHere we showed that the p43 component of the mammalian multisynthetase complex is a substrate for caspase 7, an apoptotic protease. The free recombinant, as well as the natural complex-associated p43 species, are substrates of caspase 7. However, we found that the p43 entity associated within the complex was more efficiently processed into EMAPII than its soluble form. This result suggests that the site of cleavage is made more accessible to the caspase when p43 is forced into a conformation suited for its association with the other components of the complex. Although the EEVD sequence at position 175 to 178 of murine p43 would be an ideal site for caspase 7 according to its known preferred peptide substrates (31Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar) the 141ASTD↓S145 sequence is usedin vitro by caspase 7 (this study), and the N terminus of the in vivo-generated EMAPII product also starts at residue Ser145 (14Kao J. Ryan J. Brett G. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.G. Godman G. Familletti P.C. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Stern D. Clauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20239-20247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported the crystal structure of human EMAPII (7Renault L. Kerjan P. Pasqualato S. Menetrey J. Robinson J.C. Kawaguchi S. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Mirande M. Cherfils J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Its two-domain architecture builds a pseudodimer. The 100-amino acid residue N-terminal domain forms an open β-barrel related to the 60-amino acid residue C-terminal domain by a degenerated 2-fold symmetry. The EEVD peptide belongs to strand β1 that forms the first strand of the oligonucleotide-oligosaccharide binding fold β-barrel domain. This tetrapeptide appears to be buried in the protein core and is therefore not accessible for recognition by caspase. In contrast, the released Ser145 at the N terminus is protruding from the compact structure.Following cleavage at the 141ASTD↓S145 site, the EMAPII cytokine lost its propensity to associate with the complex and is released as a monomer. The N terminus of p43 remains bound to the complex. These results are in full agreement with our previous analysis of protein-protein interactions involved in the assembly of the complex. We showed by a two-hybrid analysis that p43 is able to interact with p38, the scaffold component of the complex, but also with GlnRS and ArgRS (2Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the isolated N-terminal moiety of p43 associates with ArgRS, but its C-terminal region corresponding to EMAPII does not (3Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, p43 binds to p38 via its N-terminal domain. 2J. C. Robinson and M. Mirande, unpublished results. Thus, we anticipated that the release of EMAPII would not destabilize the quaternary structure of the complex.Examination of each of the components of the complex after caspase treatment revealed that, with the exception of ProRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases remain associated. ProRS is carried by a multifunctional polypeptide (32Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) containing an N-terminal domain corresponding to GluRS, a linker region made of repeated units with nonspecific RNA binding properties (33Cahuzac B. Berthonneau E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal ProRS domain. Cleavage of the GluProRS polypeptide by uncontrolled proteolysis led to the release of ProRS from the complex (30Kerjan P. Triconnet M. Waller J.P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because of the size of the GluRS (105 kDa) and ProRS (60 kDa) polypeptides observed after cleavage by caspase, the finding that antibodies raised against the repeated units selectively recognized the N-terminal GluRS polypeptide of 105 kDa, and the known consensus sequence for caspase 7, the aspartate residue at position 857 from the sequence 854DQVD857 of human GluProRS is likely to correspond to the cleavage site (Fig.8). AspRS and LysRS are also subjected to proteolysis, but their activities are not affected. The short polypeptides removed after cleavage by caspase 7 are therefore likely to be located at the N terminus of the two proteins, position corresponding to the eukaryotic-specific sequences that characterize the mammalian enzymes. According to the crystal structure of yeast AspRS (34Cavarelli J. Eriani G. Rees B. Ruff M. Boeglin M. Mitschler A. Martin F. Gangloff J. Thierry J.C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and of E. coli LysRS (35Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the removal of a short polypeptide at the C-terminal extremity of the two proteins should result in their inactivation. Indeed, the conserved motif 3 of class IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is located at the very C terminus of these proteins. The potential cleavage sites for caspase 7 are indicated in Fig. 8.Of particular interest is the finding that the immediate consequence of the cleavage of p43 into two equal moieties is the loss of its tRNA binding ability. The isolated domains have a weak RNA binding capacity (KD = ∼7.5–40 μm), even though the N-terminal domain is very rich in basic residues and displays a calculated pI > 9. EMAPII-like polypeptides are recurrent domains associated with various proteins. In yeast, the Arc1p protein associates with MetRS and GluRS and acts as a cofactor for tRNA delivery to the synthetase (12Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A polybasic sequence from the N-terminal region appended to the EMAPII-like domain of Arc1p is also required for efficient RNA binding. In plants, an EMAPII-like domain is appended at the C terminus of MetRS and synergizes with the MetRS domain for binding tRNA (8Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, EMAPII domains always require additional sequences to potentiate their interaction with tRNA molecules.It is worth noting that besides p43, the other targets of caspase 7 in the complex also concern peptide appendices that are eukaryote-specific and/or that are known to contribute RNA binding domains. The DQVD sequence that might be the caspase 7 recognition site in GluProRS is located in the third of the repeated units that form the linker polypeptide between the GluRS and ProRS domains. We recently determined that in human MetRS, an enzyme that possesses a single of these repeats, this polypeptide extension provides the MetRS core domain with a higher catalytic efficiency for tRNA aminoacylation. 3M. Kaminska and M. Mirande, submitted for publication. Similarly, the N-terminal polypeptide extension of human LysRS contributes an RNA binding domain that facilitates tRNA aminoacylation. 4M.

Consequently, in vivo processing of components of the multisynthetase complex by caspase 7 would have as an immediate consequence to restrict the availability of aminoacylated tRNAs and should result in the inhibition of protein synthesis. Following onset of apoptosis, cleavage of p43 and of other components of the complex would be a means to arrest translation in cells engaged in programmed cell death. Although other factors of the translation machinery, including eIF2α (36Marissen W.E. Guo Y. Thomas A.A. Matts R.L. Lloyd R.E. J. Biol.

Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, p43 binds to p38 via its N-terminal domain. 2J. C. Robinson and M. Mirande, unpublished results. Thus, we anticipated that the release of EMAPII would not destabilize the quaternary structure of the complex. Examination of each of the components of the complex after caspase treatment revealed that, with the exception of ProRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases remain associated. ProRS is carried by a multifunctional polypeptide (32Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) containing an N-terminal domain corresponding to GluRS, a linker region made of repeated units with nonspecific RNA binding properties (33Cahuzac B. Berthonneau E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal ProRS domain. Cleavage of the GluProRS polypeptide by uncontrolled proteolysis led to the release of ProRS from the complex (30Kerjan P. Triconnet M. Waller J.P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because of the size of the GluRS (105 kDa) and ProRS (60 kDa) polypeptides observed after cleavage by caspase, the finding that antibodies raised against the repeated units selectively recognized the N-terminal GluRS polypeptide of 105 kDa, and the known consensus sequence for caspase 7, the aspartate residue at position 857 from the sequence 854DQVD857 of human GluProRS is likely to correspond to the cleavage site (Fig.8). AspRS and LysRS are also subjected to proteolysis, but their activities are not affected. The short polypeptides removed after cleavage by caspase 7 are therefore likely to be located at the N terminus of the two proteins, position corresponding to the eukaryotic-specific sequences that characterize the mammalian enzymes. According to the crystal structure of yeast AspRS (34Cavarelli J. Eriani G. Rees B. Ruff M. Boeglin M. Mitschler A. Martin F. Gangloff J. Thierry J.C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and of E. coli LysRS (35Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the removal of a short polypeptide at the C-terminal extremity of the two proteins should result in their inactivation. Indeed, the conserved motif 3 of class IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is located at the very C terminus of these proteins. The potential cleavage sites for caspase 7 are indicated in Fig. 8. Of particular interest is the finding that the immediate consequence of the cleavage of p43 into two equal moieties is the loss of its tRNA binding ability. The isolated domains have a weak RNA binding capacity (KD = ∼7.5–40 μm), even though the N-terminal domain is very rich in basic residues and displays a calculated pI > 9. EMAPII-like polypeptides are recurrent domains associated with various proteins. In yeast, the Arc1p protein associates with MetRS and GluRS and acts as a cofactor for tRNA delivery to the synthetase (12Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A polybasic sequence from the N-terminal region appended to the EMAPII-like domain of Arc1p is also required for efficient RNA binding. In plants, an EMAPII-like domain is appended at the C terminus of MetRS and synergizes with the MetRS domain for binding tRNA (8Kaminska M. Deniziak M. Kerjan P. Barciszewski J. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6908-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, EMAPII domains always require additional sequences to potentiate their interaction with tRNA molecules. It is worth noting that besides p43, the other targets of caspase 7 in the complex also concern peptide appendices that are eukaryote-specific and/or that are known to contribute RNA binding domains. The DQVD sequence that might be the caspase 7 recognition site in GluProRS is located in the third of the repeated units that form the linker polypeptide between the GluRS and ProRS domains. We recently determined that in human MetRS, an enzyme that possesses a single of these repeats, this polypeptide extension provides the MetRS core domain with a higher catalytic efficiency for tRNA aminoacylation. 3M. Kaminska and M. Mirande, submitted for publication. Similarly, the N-terminal polypeptide extension of human LysRS contributes an RNA binding domain that facilitates tRNA aminoacylation. 4M. Francin and M. Mirande, unpublished results. Consequently, in vivo processing of components of the multisynthetase complex by caspase 7 would have as an immediate consequence to restrict the availability of aminoacylated tRNAs and should result in the inhibition of protein synthesis. Following onset of apoptosis, cleavage of p43 and of other components of the complex would be a means to arrest translation in cells engaged in programmed cell death. Although other factors of the translation machinery, including eIF2α (36Marissen W.E. Guo Y. Thomas A.A. Matts R.L. Lloyd R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9314-9323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and eIF4G (37Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell.

Secretion of EMAPII, the C-terminal domain of p43, results in the recruitment of macrophages (14Kao J. Ryan J. Brett G. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.G. Godman G. Familletti P.C. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Stern D.

In this regard, p43 may compare with a molecular fuse. In its native pro-EMAPII form, it is an important cofactor for aminoacylation. After the fuse has blown, translation is irreversibly switched off, and EMAPII enters the cell death signaling pathway. In vitro assays showed that full-length recombinant p43 is also a potent cytokine (17Kornelyuk A. Tas M.P.R. Dubrovsky A. Murray J.C. Biopolym.

This suggests that association of p43 within the multisynthetase complex inhibits its cytokine activity and/or sequesters proEMAPII in a cellular compartment and prevents its entry into apoptotic pathways until it is cleaved off the complex. Only a processed form of p43 is recovered in the supernatant of apoptotic cells. 6V. Shalak and M. Mirande, unpublished results. The pathway of EMAPII secretion remains to be deciphered. We thank M.

Johannes C. Schulte-Frohlinde D. Mutagenesis. 1992; 7: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Radiation-induced DSBs are formed by fragmentation of deoxyribose, typically leaving in each strand a one-base gap with 5′-phosphate and either 3′-phosphate or 3′-phosphoglycolate (PG) termini (14Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 15Hutchinson F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 711-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such DSBs present to repair systems a more complex substrate than simple restriction enzyme cuts, potentially increasing the possibility of errors during rejoining. In this report, we describe how synthetic substrates containing mimics of radiation-induced breaks, with defined geometry and chemical structure (see Figs. 1 and 2), are processed in several in vitro end joining systems. The results suggest a Ku-dependent repair process that can accurately restore the original DNA sequence at sites of these complex DSBs, through the use of very short residual complementarities at the ends of the break.Figure 2End joining substrates and repair products. A, the 3′-PG(•) 3′-overhang substrate mimics the DSB that would result from free radical-mediated deoxyribose fragmentation on a 3-base 3′ stagger. Accurate repair (43-base product) would require alignment-based fill-in prior to ligation. B, the one-sided 3′-overhang substrate was included as a control to assess the effect of incomplete ligation in construction of the 3′-overhang substrate. In theory, it cannot form any 43-base product, but it could form a 42-base product by fill-in of the 10-base 5′-overhang, abutting of the ends, and continuation of fill-in using the 3′-overhang as a template; 41-, 40-, and 39-base products would result from removal of 1, 2, and 3 bases, respectively, from the 3′-overhang prior to fill-in.C, the 5′-overhang substrate lacks the 1-base gaps but is otherwise similar to a 2-base-5′-staggered free radical-mediated DSB. All three substrates can, by various degrees of 3′-resection and/or fill-in, be converted to an intermediate with self-complementary CGCG 5′-overhangs, the alignment of which would result in the 35-base repair product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe capacity of mammalian cells to join mismatched DNA ends based on short partial complementarities in single strand overhangs was first noticed in the repair joints formed when linearized plasmids with mismatched restriction ends were recircularized upon transfection into monkey CV-1 cells (35Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4295-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In some of these repair joints, partial complementarities in 3′-overhangs had apparently been used for alignment, despite the fact that such alignment would initially leave single strand gaps in the aligned ends. This phenomenon implied a quite remarkable process, termed “postrepair ligation” (Fig.2 A), wherein the putative repair complex must have held the two ends in juxtaposition and maintained base pairing of a 2- or 3-base complementarity in the overhangs while at the same time allowing a polymerase to fill in the gaps to produce a ligatable substrate. Laterin vitro experiments using Xenopus egg extracts (36Thode S. Schafer A. Pfeiffer P. Vielmetter W. Cell. 1990; 60: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Pfeiffer P. Thode S. Hancke J. Vielmetter W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) confirmed that such processing was indeed possible, and thus an “alignment factor” was proposed but not identified.While such an alignment mechanism has been invoked primarily to explain the microhomologies typically found at sequence junctions of various illegitimate recombination events (38Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination.in: American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1988: 621-653Google Scholar, 39Meuth M. Berg D. Howe M. Mobile DNA.in: American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 833-853Google Scholar), the same mechanism would be ideally suited for the accurate repair of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation and other free radical-based genotoxins. Radiation-induced breaks are the result of clustered free radical-mediated sugar fragmentation (28Ward J.F. Radiat. Res. 1981; 86: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and therefore are likely to be randomly staggered and to have cohesive overhangs of one to several bases, along with blocked 3′ termini (14Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 15Hutchinson F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1985; 32: 115-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 17Henner W.D. Rodriguez L.O. Hecht S.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 711-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a one-base gap in each strand, and possible ancillary base damage in the overhangs (40Sutherland B.M. Bennett P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Thus, the use ofpartial complementarities for alignment of the overhangs during gap filling and ligation would be essential for accurate restoration of the original sequence (Fig. 2). The same requirement would apply to repair of breaks induced by enediyne antibiotics, which involve similar sugar fragmentation on a defined 2- or 3-base 3′ stagger (41Dedon P.C. Goldberg I.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 311-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 42Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).The possibility that Ku might be the long sought “alignment factor” was suggested by its capacity to promote DNA end-to-end association (5Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 6Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1412-1415PubMed Google Scholar) and to enhance the joining of either blunt or cohesive DSBs by mammalian DNA ligases (29Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Nick McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The strongest evidence, however, comes from recent analysis of repair joints formed in CHO-K1 andxrs6 extracts during the recircularization of substrates with mismatched restriction ends (8Feldmann E. Schmiemann V. Goedecke W. Reichenberger S. Pfeiffer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2585-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These data imply a critical role for Ku in preserving 3′-overhangs during end joining. Repair joints requiring alignment-based fill-in (see Fig. 2) prior to ligation, in particular, were only formed in extracts from cells expressing functional Ku.The present results imply a role for Ku in the accurate end joining of staggered free radical-mediated DSBs. For a break formed on a 3-base 3′ stagger (giving a 2-base complementarity and a 1-base gap in each strand), a majority, perhaps nearly all, of the end joining events in CHO-K1 extracts reflected complete restoration of the original sequence, whereas in Ku-deficient xrs6 extracts, no accurate joins were detected. Accurate end joining could be restored by the addition of highly purified (25Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) human Ku to the xrs6extracts, clearly implicating Ku (rather than, for example, other proteins that might have become either destabilized or overexpressed in Ku-deficient cells) as the critical factor in enforcing the fidelity of end joining. Analogous experiments implicate Ku in preserving the accuracy of joining of a substrate with cohesive 5′-overhangs as well, although in this case the requirement for Ku was not absolute. Intriguingly, however, whereas for the 5′-overhang substrate both the accuracy and the efficiency of joining in the Ku-supplemented extract was comparable with that seen in CHO-K1 extract, for the 3′-overhang substrate the efficiency was reduced by more than 30-fold. These results suggest qualitative differences in the precise function of Ku in the joining of the two types of breaks, such that one process is more sensitive to as yet undefined differences between the endogenous hamster and exogenous human Ku.The internal labeling of the 3′-PG substrates allows intermediate processing of the DNA ends to be analyzed at single-nucleotide resolution, directly demonstrating that, as inferred from analysis of repair joints (8Feldmann E. Schmiemann V. Goedecke W. Reichenberger S. Pfeiffer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2585-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), 3′-end processing and resection are more extensive in Ku-deficient extracts. Nevertheless, the amount of free 3′-hydroxyl-terminated -ACG overhangs available for fill-in and ligation, particularly at short incubation times (data not shown), was comparable in xrs6 and CHO-K1 extracts, yet formation of accurately joined 43-base products in the xrs6 extracts was undetectable, at least 50-fold lower than in CHO-K1 (Fig.3 A). This result implies a specific requirement for Ku in alignment during gap filling and/or ligation, in addition to its apparent role in protecting ends from 3′ resection. The enzyme that initiates processing by removing the 3′-PG is not known, but it is probably not the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease Ape1/Hap1; although Ape1 is the only mammalian enzyme thus far identified that is capable of removing 3′-PGs, it has no detectable activity toward PGs on 3′-overhangs (43Suh D.

Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Other activities for removing blocking groups from 3′ termini have been detected in cell extracts but have not been identified or cloned (45Winters T.A. Weinfeld M. Jorgensen T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).Our data, like those derived from substrates with mismatched restriction ends (8Feldmann E. Schmiemann V. Goedecke W. Reichenberger S. Pfeiffer P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2585-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), do not support models in which Ku or DNA-PK catalyzes melting of DNA ends, resulting in exposure and annealing of microhomologies within double strand regions (1Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 9Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). On the contrary, end joining events consistent with such annealing were much more frequent in Ku-deficient xrs6 extracts and were completely suppressed by the addition of purified Ku (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, in the Xenopus system, it has been shown that such joining is efficiently catalyzed by extract fractions devoid of Ku and DNA-PKcs (47Göttlich B. Reichenberger S. Feldmann E. Pfeiffer P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies (48Paull T.T. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) suggest that the Mre11 complex is a much more likely candidate for catalyzing end joining based on microhomologies within duplex regions near DNA ends.DNA-PKcs-deficient XR-C1 extracts, unlike Ku-deficient xrs6extracts, yielded substantial quantities of accurate 43-base repair products. Moreover, the DNA-PK inhibitor wortmannin had little effect on end joining in CHO-K1 extracts. These results suggest that only Ku and not DNA-PKcs is essential for accurate end joining in vitro. However, in human and Xenopus extracts, end joining of the same substrates is qualitatively similar but is wortmannin-sensitive. Although the wortmannin data are to some extent complicated by the effects of Me2SO alone (a finding that emphasizes the need for concurrent solvent controls whenever this inhibitor is used), we consistently find nearly complete suppression of end joining by wortmannin and other DNA-PK inhibitors in these extracts. While the disparity in wortmannin sensitivity could be due to technical factors such as the differences in preparation of the various extracts, it could reflect the levels of DNA-PKcs. DNA-PK activity is typically 50–100-fold lower in hamster and other rodent cell extracts than in human cell or Xenopus egg extracts (49Walker A.I. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Anderson C.W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 50Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar, 51Finnie N.J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and electrophoresis mobility shift assays as well as Western blot assays are consistent with this difference being due to a much lower level of DNA-PKcs protein in rodent cells (53Ting N.S. Chan D.W. Lintott L.G. Allalunis-Turner J. Lees-Miller S.P. Radiat. Res. 1999; 151: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), including CHO cells. 2S. P. Lees-Miller, unpublished results. Thus, a hypothesis consistent with all of the available data is that although DNA-PKcs is not required for accurate end joining in vitro, sufficient quantities of it produce an inhibitory effect that can be alleviated by activation of its kinase activity.Recent chemical cross-linking studies (54Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), as well as physical-chemical data on the binding and activation of Ku and DNA-PKcs (55West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 56Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggest that when Ku recruits DNA-PKcs to a DNA end, DNA-PKcs then occupies the extreme end of the DNA and displaces Ku ∼10 base pairs into the interior. The DNA end is probably threaded into a channel in DNA-PKcs (revealed by electron crystallography (57Leuther K.K. Hammarsten O. Kornberg R.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) that is open at both ends and can accommodate ∼12 base pairs of duplex DNA. It is also known that Ku can promote DNA end-to-end association and that both Ku and DNA-PKcs, when present, often remain bound at the end-to-end junction (5Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 7Pang D. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Jung M. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1412-1415PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the present data could be explained by a model of in vitro end joining wherein there is an absolute requirement for proper positioning of Ku such that it bridges the two DNA ends being joined, in order for PG removal, alignment-based fill-in, and ligation to proceed (see Fig. 2 A). In theXenopus and human extracts, Ku may be temporarily displaced from the ends and into the interior of DNA by DNA-PKcs, which may still maintain end-to-end association but not permit end processing. As has been proposed previously (12Calsou P. Frit P. Humbert O. Muller C. Chen D.J. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7848-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), DNA-PK-catalyzed phosphorylation (of DNA-PKcs, Ku, or some other protein in the complex) might then promote either DNA-PKcs dissociation or sliding of the whole complex along the aligned DNA ends, thus allowing Ku to move to its proper position bridging the ends. Phosphorylation of both Ku70 and Ku80 during end joining has been detected in Xenopus egg extracts (52Labhart P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although in similar experiments we have detected only Ku80 phosphorylation. 3S. Chen and L. F. Povirk, unpublished results. Thus, in this model, the role of DNA-PKcs is primarily regulatory, initially displacing Ku and thus controlling the timing of end processing through specific phosphorylations, the details of which remain to be defined.The apparent dispensability of DNA-PKcs in accurate end joining in CHO-K1 extracts does not necessarily imply that it plays no important role in end joining in intact rodent cells. Indeed, at least some rodent cells lacking DNA-PKcs exhibit the same radiosensitivity and DSB repair deficiency as those lacking Ku (4Jeggo P.A. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this disparity is that DNA-PKcs may play a role in bringing broken DNA ends together, a task that might be much more difficult and complex in intact cells than in in vitro assays, where free ends are relatively abundant. Consistent with this proposal, DNA-PKcs has been reported to promote intermolecular ligation by ligase IV plus XRCC4, while inhibiting intramolecular ligation (58Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26196-26205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the fact that intramolecular recircularization dominates end joining inXenopus extracts but does not occur at all in human extracts, despite an apparent abundance of DNA-PKcs in both (49Walker A.I. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Anderson C.W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 50Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar, 51Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 52Labhart P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), remains to be explained.Alternatively, recent in situ fluorescence labeling studies suggest that DNA-PK may be largely or at least partly responsible for the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, an event that occurs within minutes of irradiation (59Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Localization of phosphorylated H2AX at putative DSB repair foci precedes the colocalization of Brca1, hRad51, and/or the hMre11-hRad50-NBS complex at the same foci, suggesting that H2AX may recruit these DSB repair factors to sites of multiple or difficult-to-repair breaks. Thus, DNA-PK holoenzyme may play a critical role in initiating a complex choreography that serves to optimize repair by assigning broken ends to specific repair pathways (60Petrini J.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1264-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 61Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6087-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), some of which probably do not utilize Ku for end alignment. Indeed, a defect in DNA-PK activation rather than in end alignment could be the primary reason for the radiosensitivity of Ku-defective cells. The availability of a stringent reconstitution assay (Fig.3 A) may facilitate the identification of Ku mutants differentially defective in each of these two functions and thus allow assessment of their relative importance in DSB repair efficiency, repair fidelity, and radiosensitivity. The assay might also be useful in determining what domains and biochemical properties of Ku70 and Ku80 are required for particular steps in the alignment-based end joining pathway. Cells deficient in any of the three components of DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK1 (i.e. the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs or either subunit of the DNA end binding heterodimer Ku) are partially deficient in the rejoining of double strand breaks (DSBs) (1Chu G.

The precise roles of the individual subunits in the repair process are not known, but possible functions have been suggested based on their known biochemical properties. Ku has been proposed to align DNA ends and thus promote ligation (5Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 6Cary R.B. Peterson S.R.

Strikingly, the presence of this polymorphism correlates with susceptibility to the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis. In this study we investigated the mechanism by which the polymorphism enhances splicing of CD45 exon 4. We found that at least four distinct splicing regulatory elements exist within exon 4 and that the strongest of these elements is an exonic splicing silencer (designated ESS1), which is disrupted by the polymorphism. We show that ESS1 normally functions to repress the weak 5′ splice site (ss) of CD45 exon 4. The ESS1 sequence also suppresses the splicing of a heterologous 5′ss and associates with a specific complex in nuclear extracts. We further demonstrate that ESS1 is juxtaposed to a purine-rich enhancer sequence that activates the use of the 5′ss of exon 4. Thus, proper functioning of the immune system is dependent on a complex interplay of regulatory activities that mediate the appropriate splicing of CD45 exon 4.

In T cells, CD45 functions to maintain the T-cell receptor in a primed state, allowing for activation of the T-cell receptor upon interaction with an antigen-presenting cell (reviewed in Refs. 1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar and 2Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). In mice that contain a knock-out of CD45, the few T cells that survive development are no longer reactive to antigen, and immune function is impaired (3Kishihara K. Penninger J. Wallace V.A.

Smith A.J.H. May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Similarly, CD45-deficient humans have severe combined immunodeficiency disease (5Cale C.M. Klein N.J. Novelli V. Veys P. Jones A.M. Morgan G. Arch. Dis. Child. 1997; 76: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Kung C. Pingel J.T. Heikinheimo M. Klemola T. Varkila K. Yoo L.I. Vuopala K. Poyhonen M. Uhari M. Rogers M. Speck S.H. Chatila T. Thomas M.L. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Conversely, T cells that express a constitutively active form of CD45 are hyper-reactive to antigen, and mice containing such cells are prone to develop autoimmune disease (7Majeti R. Xu Z. Parslow T.G. Olson J.L. Daikh D.I. Killeen N. Weiss A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1059-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, both CD45 activity and regulation of this activity are critical for the proper functioning of the immune system. The gene encoding human CD45 encompasses 33 exons. Three of these exons (exons 4, 5, and 6) are alternatively spliced, giving rise to at least five distinct isoforms that differ in their extracellular domain. The alternative splicing of CD45 is highly regulated in both a tissue-specific manner and upon activation of T cells, although the mechanism(s) by which regulation occurs is largely unknown (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The various expressed CD45 isoforms do not differ with regard to their intracellular phosphatase domains. However, it has been proposed that alternative exon usage does indirectly influence phosphatase activity by altering the dimerization of CD45 (7Majeti R. Xu Z. Parslow T.G. Olson J.L. Daikh D.I. Killeen N. Weiss A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1059-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that at least some isoforms of CD45 exist as dimers and that in these dimers the phosphatase activity of each molecule is blocked by steric hindrance (7Majeti R. Xu Z. Parslow T.G. Olson J.L. Daikh D.I. Killeen N. Weiss A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1059-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Because the alternate isoforms of CD45 differ in the primary sequence of the extracellular domain, as well as the extent ofO-glycosylation and sialation of this domain, it is likely that they also differ in their ability to dimerize. In particular, exclusion of the variable exons, such as that which occurs upon T cell activation, is predicted to decrease the dimerization of CD45, resulting in a decrease in CD45 function. Thus, the regulation of CD45 splicing may be one mechanism by which an immune response is down-regulated following an initial antigen challenge. Exon 4 is the most tightly regulated of the CD45 variable exons (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In naive T cells, a significant portion of the translated CD45 is encoded by mRNA that includes exon 4. In contrast, the majority of the CD45 protein expressed in activated and memory T cells is encoded by mRNA that lacks exon 4. Several years ago it was shown that a small percentage of the human population expresses aberrantly high levels of exon 4-encoded CD45 isoforms in all cell types (8Schwinzer R. Wonigeit K. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Schwinzer R. Schraven B. Kyas U. Meuer S.C. Wonigeit K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1095-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This misregulation of exon 4 inclusion correlated with the presence of a C to G polymorphism at nucleotide 77 (C77G) of exon 4, which is silent with respect to coding sequence (10Thude H. Hundrieser J. Wonigeit K. Schwinzer R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we and others demonstrated that engineering the C77G polymorphism into a CD45 minigene is sufficient to confer abnormally high expression of exon 4 in mature mRNA ((11, 12) and see Fig. 1 B). Importantly, consistent with the hypothesis that regulation of CD45 splicing is critical for the appropriate function of the immune system, the C77G polymorphism was recently shown to correlate with development of multiple sclerosis. This conclusion is based on the observation that the prevalence of the C77G polymorphism is significantly greater among multiple sclerosis patients than in healthy controls (13Jacobsen M. Schweer D. Ziegler A. Gaber R. Schock S. Schwinzer R. Wonigeit K. Lindert R.B. Kantarci O. Schaefer-Klein J. Schipper H.I. Oertel W.H. Heidenreich F. Weinshenker B.G. Sommer N. Hemmer B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, this polymorphism co-segregates with disease in at least four independent families (13Jacobsen M. Schweer D. Ziegler A. Gaber R. Schock S. Schwinzer R. Wonigeit K. Lindert R.B. Kantarci O. Schaefer-Klein J. Schipper H.I. Oertel W.H. Heidenreich F. Weinshenker B.G. Sommer N. Hemmer B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in understanding how the regulation of CD45 splicing is altered by the C77G change within exon 4. In general, the splicing of any given exon is primarily determined by the sequences at the 3′ and 5′ exon-intron boundaries (splice sites). These splice site sequences function as binding sites for small nuclear ribonuclear particles (snRNPs),1 which form the core of the spliceosome and direct RNA cleavage and ligation (for review see Ref. 14Reed R. Palandjian L. Krainer A.R. Eukaryotic mRNA Processing.in: Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 103-129Google Scholar). However, in mammals the sequences at the 3′ and 5′ splice sites are poorly conserved and are often insufficient for optimal recognition by the snRNPs (15Black D.L. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, the splicing of many mammalian exons is dependent on the presence of additional sequences within the exon itself or within the flanking intron. Numerous splicing enhancers have been identified that promote exon splicing by helping to recruit snRNPs to the splice sites and/or by promoting polyadenylation (reviewed in Refs. 17Wang J. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 19Smith C.W.J. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In addition, other sequences have been shown to inhibit splicing of a given exon via mechanisms that include the steric hindrance of closely neighboring splice sites, sequestration of snRNPs, and sequestration of splice sites (17Wang J. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Smith C.W.J. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The activity of such enhancing and inhibitory sequence elements may be constitutive or may be regulated by specific trans-acting factors, thereby allowing for regulated splice site use (19Smith C.W.J. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In fact, it has recently been proposed that the splicing of most, if not all, mammalian exons are influenced by at least some constitutive enhancer or inhibitor elements in addition to the canonical splice sites (16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 20Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that indeed multiple, opposing, splicing regulatory elements exist within exon 4 of CD45. Moreover, we show that the multiple sclerosis-associated C77G mutation disrupts the strongest of these elements, namely an exonic silencer element that functions by inhibiting the use of the 5′splice sites (ss) of exon 4. The minigene constructs used in this study were all derived from the previously described minigene MG4, which is subcloned into the MluI-ClaI sites of the stable expression vector pAWneo3 (12Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The two-intron substitution constructs, QC1–QC10 and C77G, were all synthesized using the QuikChange Kit (Stratagene). The resultant mutant minigenes were fully sequenced and reinserted into a fresh pAWneo3 vector to ensure that no extraneous mutations existed that might alter the splicing of the minigene. The single-intron constructs encompassing exons 3 and 4 or 4 and 7 were synthesized using PCR to truncate exon 4. For exon 3–4 constructs a PCR primer was used that terminates exon 4 at nucleotide 181 followed by a ClaI restriction site. For exon 4–7 constructs a PCR primer was used that contains an MluI restriction site followed immediately by exon 4 beginning at nucleotide 18. The C77G, QC2, QC3, QC4, and QC5 mutations were then introduced into the truncated minigenes as described above for the three-exon minigene. The 5′ss UP mutations were also introduced into the exon 3–4–7 and 4–7 constructs using the QuikChange mutagenesis method. For the CD45 exon 4-globin exon 2 chimera, the CD45 portion contains exon 4 (beginning at nucleotide 18) and ∼200 nucleotides (nt) of normal flanking downstream intron (up to a naturally occurringBglII site) were ligated to an engineered BglII site within the normal β-globin intron ∼60 nucleotides upstream of exon 2. For the ESS1 insertion into the β-globin transcript, complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized that contain the entire ESS1 sequence (nt 29–88) with or without the C77G change, flanked byNcoI sites. The oligos were annealed and inserted into the natural NcoI site located 92 nucleotides upstream of the 5′ss of globin exon 1 (20Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The plasmid templates for RNA transcription were generated as follows. Complementary oligos corresponding to nucleotides 40–90 of CD45 exon 4 were annealed and inserted into the SmaI site of a variant of pSP64 (Promega), which has a T7 promoter immediately adjacent to theSmaI site, to give the plasmid pT7-ESS1. pT7-ESS1-C77G was created in the same way except that the synthesized oligos contain the C77G polymorphism. The plasmid Rx2 was described previously (21Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2089-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All RT-PCR assays were done exactly as detailed previously (12Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The conditions were determined empirically to result in a signal that was linear with respect to input RNA. RT-PCR reactions were resolved on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantitated using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji). Nuclear extract was prepared from JSL1 cells using a standard protocol (22Eperon, I. C., Krainer, A. R., RNA Processing: A Practical Approach, Higgins, S. J., Hames, B. D., 1, 1994, 57, 102, Oxford University Press, New York.Google Scholar). The competitor RNAs, WT, C77G, and Dsx, were synthesized from the plasmids pT7-ESS1, pT7-ESS1-C77G, and Rx2, respectively, by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). For the radiolabeled ESS1 RNA probe, [32P]CTP was added during transcription. Following transcription, all RNAs were gel-purified. To assay binding, ESS1 probe RNA was incubated with the JSL1 nuclear extract under standard splicing conditions (22Eperon, I. C., Krainer, A. R., RNA Processing: A Practical Approach, Higgins, S. J., Hames, B. D., 1, 1994, 57, 102, Oxford University Press, New York.Google Scholar) for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of cold competitor RNA. The reactions were then placed on ice, and heparin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Reactions were loaded on a prerun 4.5% polyacrylamide 0.5× TBE gel and run at 150 V for 1.5 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The effect of the C77G polymorphism on the splicing of CD45 exon 4 can be explained by one of two general models. Either the polymorphism disrupts a sequence that normally represses the recognition of exon 4, or alternatively the change from C to G at position 77 creates a novel splicing enhancer element. The former possibility is supported by data from a linker scanning mutagenesis of CD45 exon 4, which was designed to determine the sequences involved in regulating the exclusion of this exon from transcripts expressed in thymocytes (23Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). That study identified three regions corresponding to nt 8–11, 40–92, and 126–137 that, when mutated, resulted in the aberrant inclusion of exon 4. Although the identification of nt 40–92 as repressing sequences is consistent with a model in which the C77G polymorphism disrupts a splicing repressor element, there are two important caveats to this original study. First, in the linker scanning substitutions there was some modification of exon length and no indication of whether the substituting sequences had any inherent effect on splicing (23Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Secondly, that study was done prior to the discovery of the C77G polymorphism, so a direct comparison has not been done between the linker scanning results and the effect of the C77G mutation. We have previously developed and characterized a cell line JSL1, which faithfully reproduces the pattern of CD45 splicing that is observed in mature, naive T cells (12Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified a CD45 minigene consisting of variable exon 4 flanked by constitutive exons 3 and 7 that, when stably expressed in JSL1 cells, shows a pattern of exon 4 inclusion consistent with that seen in the endogenous CD45 gene (12Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Importantly, when the C77G polymorphism is engineered into our CD45 minigene, it results in a dramatic increase in the inclusion of exon 4 ((12) and Fig. 1 B). Therefore, our minigene and cell line provide a good model system to study in more detail the effect of the C77G polymorphism on the splicing of CD45 exon 4. To understand why the C77G polymorphism increases the inclusion of exon 4, we first wanted to map potential exonic regulatory elements within exon 4 in the context of our minigene. To do this we systematically changed blocks of 20 nt within exon 4 to a heterologous 20-mer sequence (Fig. 1 A). The heterologous sequence we used for these substitutions is a sequence from the IgM gene that was previously shown to lack intrinsic splicing enhancer activity (24Watakabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The resultant mutant minigenes, as well as the wild type counterpart, were transfected into the JSL1 cells, and individual clones that stably expressed the desired minigene were isolated and expanded. To determine the relative splicing of exon 4 in these various minigenes, we analyzed total cellular RNA by an RT-PCR assay, which we have described previously (12Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To ensure that any differences seen were not the result of random clonal variation, we analyzed four to six independent clones for each minigene. In each case we detected no significant variation among the independent clones; however, for simplicity, in this study we only show two to three representative clones for each minigene. Consistent with our previous results, 40–50% of transcripts from the wild type minigene contain exon 4 ((12) and Fig. 1, B andC). Strikingly, the splicing of exon 4 is dramatically stimulated when nucleotides 29–48, 49–68, or 69–88 are substituted with the heterologous sequence, similar to the effect of the C77G polymorphism (compare Fig. 1 C, QC2,QC3, and QC4, and Fig. 1 B). The stimulation of exon 4 splicing observed in constructs QC2–QC4 is unlikely to be a consequence of the insertion of the heterologous sequence because the substitution of this sequence at other locations within exon 4 had either the opposite effect (QC5 andQC8) or no effect (QC1, QC7, andQC10) on the inclusion of exon 4 (Fig. 1 C). In addition, the results shown here with QC2–QC4 are very similar to those obtained by Streuli and Saito (23Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) upon the substitution of nucleotides 40–92 with a sequence unrelated to that used in this study. Thus, we conclude that the region of exon 4 encompassing nucleotides 29–88 most likely represents a strong exonic splicing silencer (ESS), which represses the inclusion of this exon. In addition to the strong ESS at nucleotides 29–88 (ESS1), our mutational analysis reveals the presence of multiple additional elements within exon 4 that influence its splicing, albeit more weakly than ESS1 (Fig. 1 C). Substitution of nucleotides 169–188 results in the increased inclusion of exon 4. In contrast, the inclusion of exon 4 is decreased significantly upon substitution of nucleotides 89–108 and 149–168, indicating that these sequences may normally function to enhance exon 4 splicing. Therefore, multiple, competing splicing regulatory elements likely exist within CD45 exon 4. Because of our interest in the C77G polymorphism, this study focuses on understanding the role of the ESS1 element and its effect on the flanking splice sites and juxtaposed regulatory element (nt 89–108). The first step in the splicing of an exon involves the recognition of the 3′- and 5′ss (14Reed R. Palandjian L. Krainer A.R. Eukaryotic mRNA Processing.in: Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 103-129Google Scholar). Although the recognition of one splice site often facilitates the use of the other through a process known as exon definition, the two splice sites can also be recognized independently and are both potential sites of regulation (16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 25Graveley B. RNA ( N. Y. ). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). To determine which of the splice sites of exon 4 is regulated by the C77G polymorphism and by ESS1, we made single-intron minigene constructs in which exon 4 was truncated either just upstream of the 5′ss or just downstream of the 3′ss (see Fig. 2, A andB, respectively). Strikingly, RT-PCR analysis of multiple clones that stably express these minigenes indicates that the 3′ss of exon 4 is recognized constitutively (Fig. 2 A,WT), whereas splicing of the 5′ss of exon 4 in the absence of the 3′ss is very inefficient (Fig. 2 B, WT). Moreover, in the presence of the C77G polymorphism, the use of the 5′ss is dramatically increased (Fig. 2 B), whereas this polymorphism has no apparent effect on 3′ss utilization (Fig.2 A). In all cases the RT-PCR assays were done under conditions in which no signal was detectable when reverse transcriptase was omitted, confirming that the slower migrating band is indeed unspliced RNA and not contaminating genomic DNA (data not shown). To confirm that the 5′ss of exon 4 and not the 3′ss of exon 7 is the sequence that is regulated by the C77G polymorphism, we constructed a minigene chimera consisting of CD45 exon 4 fused to a heterologous exon. The heterologous exon we chose to use is the 3′ss and complete exon 2 of the human β-globin gene, which is spliced constitutively (20Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The splicing of the resultant CD45 exon 4-globin exon 2 chimera is inefficient because of the weak 5′ss of CD45 exon 4 (Fig.2 C, WT). However, as predicted, the substitution of the C77G polymorphism into the chimera strongly enhances the splicing of the 5′ss of exon 4 to the heterologous β-globin exon (Fig. 2 C, C77G). Finally, to determine whether the C77G polymorphism functions similarly to the other ESS1 mutations, we constructed the QC2, QC3, and QC4 substitutions in the context of the CD45 exon 4-exon 7 minigene. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the QC2-QC4 substitutions indeed strongly promote use of the 5′ss of exon 4, indicating that these substitutions are mechanistically similar to the C77G mutation. Taken together, these data indicate that ESS1 inhibits use of the 5′ss of exon 4 and further indicate that the C77G polymorphism allows for inclusion of exon 4 by disrupting the activity of this silencer. The canonical sequence of a mammalian 5′ss is AG/GUAAGU in which / indicates the point of cleavage (14Reed R. Palandjian L. Krainer A.R. Eukaryotic mRNA Processing.in: Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 103-129Google Scholar). Although the 5′ss of CD45 exon 4 contains the most critical of these nucleotides (the GU at positions +1 and +2 relative to the cleavage site and a G at position +5), it differs from the consensus at the other positions in the intron (Fig.3, A and B). The differences between the consensus 5′ss sequence and that present at the 5′ss of exon 4 suggest that the 5′ss of exon 4 might be inherently weak. To test this possibility and investigate the influence of 5′ss strength on exon 4 splicing, we constructed minigenes in which the 5′ss of exon 4 was mutated to exactly match the canonical mammalian 5′ss. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively, this 5′ss UP mutation results in a significant increase in the splicing of a two-exon single-intron construct and results in the complete inclusion of exon 4 in a three-exon construct. Thus, the 5′ss of exon 4 is inherently weak, and this characteristic is important for its incomplete inclusion and susceptibility to regulation. However, we do note that in the single-intron construct in which the UP mutation does not result in complete recognition of the 5′ss, the presence of the C77G polymorphism does allow for further use of the 5′ss (Fig.3 A, 90% versus 96% splicing). Therefore, the ESS1 can suppress, albeit weakly, the utilization of an optimized 5′ss. As mentioned above, the ESS1 is only one of several exonic elements that appear to influence the splicing of exon 4. We were particularly interested in the presence of a putative exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) positioned immediately downstream of ESS1 (nt 89–108). Previous studies have identified similar cases of a juxtaposed splicing enhancer and inhibitor that function to counterbalance each other (26Kan J.L.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 462-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The sequence of the ESS1 proximal enhancer element, which we term ESE1, closely resembles that of a canonical purine-rich splicing enhancer. Most well characterized purine-rich enhancers have been shown to enhance the use of a weak 3′ss (24Watakabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 27Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Lavigueur H. Branche L. Kornblitt A.R. Chabot B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 29Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, there is at least one example of enhancement of a 5′ss by a purine-rich enhancer (30Bourgeois C.F. Popeilarz M. Stevenin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7347-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as well as an example of 5′ss enhancement by a non-purine-rich element (31Ryner L.C. Goodwin S.F. Castrillon D.H. Anand A. Villella A. Baker B.S. Hall J.C. Taylor B.J. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether ESE1 stimulates the use of exon 4 splicing by enhancing 3′ss recognition or alternatively, whether ESE1 functions to counter repression of the 5′ss by the ESS1. As shown in Fig.4 A, splicing to the 3′ss of exon 4 is equally efficient in the presence or absence of ESE1. In contrast, disruption of ESE1 by the QC5 substitution further decreases the inefficient recognition of the 5′ss by 2-fold (Fig. 4 B). Thus, we conclude that the ESE1 element activates exon 4 inclusion by enhancing 5′ss use. Given that the ESS1 and ESE1 appear to influence the same step in exon 4 recognition, we next wanted to determine whether the activities of ESS1 and ESE1 were inter-related or separable. For example, if the ESS1 represses 5′ss use by directly suppressing the enhancer activity of ESE1, then when the ESE1 element is absent, disruption of the ESS1 should have no effect. As shown in Fig. 4 C, this prediction is clearly not met. Instead, we observe that disruption of ESS1 by the C77G polymorphism in the background of the ESE1-eliminating substitution QC5 results in a significant increase in exon inclusion (from 14 to 58%). Similarly, elimination of ESE1 in the background of the C77G polymorphism decreases the splicing of exon 4 from 95 to 58%. Therefore, we conclude that the ESS1 and ESE1 function independently of each other to influence utilization of the 5′ss of exon 4. To further determine whether the ESS1 truly functions as a separable splicing silencer element, we tested whether the presence of the ESS1 could confer repression on a heterologous splicing construct. When stably expressed in JSL1 cells, exons 1 and 2 of a human β-globin minigene are spliced together with relatively high efficiency (Fig.5, Glo). However, this efficiency is significantly decreased when the ESS1 is inserted ∼80 nt upstream of the 5′ss of exon 1 (Fig. 5, GloESS) such that the relative percentage of unspliced transcript increases by more than 3-fold. Importantly, at least half of the ESS1 repression of β-g"

These reports suggest that CaMKIV functions as a CREB kinase and regulates CREB-dependent gene expression in neurons, which may in turn be linked to a protein synthesis-dependent long lasting synaptic plasticity. To understand the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and function of CaMKIV, it is essential to know how CaMKIV activity changes following application of conditioning stimuli such as high frequency stimulation (HFS) to induce LTP and how CREB phosphorylation is regulated by CaMKIV and other protein kinases under these conditions. In the present study, we examined CaMKIV activation with simultaneous CREB phosphorylation and stimulation of gene expression during HFS-induced LTP in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. The following chemicals and materials were obtained from the indicated sources: [γ-32P]ATP and125I-protein A from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; calmidazolium (R24517) and H89 from Sigma; KT5720 from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA); KN93 and KN92 from Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan); U0126 and U0124 from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); protein A-Sepharose CL-4B from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; anti-active MAPK antibody from Promega (Madison, WI); anti-CREB and anti-pCREB antibodies from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); anti-ERK2 antibody from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA); anti-c-Fos (Ab-2) antibody from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA); and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from ICN/Cappel (Aurora, OH). Electrophysiological experiments were performed basically according to a previous report (7Liu J. Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Nishi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The brains were rapidly removed from ether-anesthetized male Wistar rats (5–7 weeks old), and the hippocampi were dissected out. Transverse hippocampal slices (450 μm thick) prepared using a McIlwain tissue chopper were incubated in continuously oxygenized (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at room temperature for at least 2 h. After a 2-h recovery period, a slice was transferred to an interface recording chamber and perfused at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with ACSF warmed at 30 °C. The field EPSP (fEPSP) was evoked by 0.05 Hz test stimuli through a bipolar stimulating electrode placed on the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway and recorded from the stratum radiatum of CA1 using a glass electrode filled with 3 m NaCl. In the case of CA3 LTP, a stimulating electrode was placed on the mossy fibers in the dentate region, and the recordings were made from the stratum lucidum of CA3. The recording was performed using a single-electrode amplifier (CEZ-3100, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), and the maximal value of the initial fEPSP slope was collected and averaged for every 1 min (3 traces) using an A/D converter (PowerLab 200; ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia) and a personal computer. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke a fEPSP of 1.0-mV amplitude. After the stable base-line recording was obtained, a HFS of 100 Hz frequency and 1-s duration was applied two times with a 20-s interval between times, and then the recording was continued for the indicated periods in the figures. For the control, slices recorded for the same periods without HFS were prepared. The following inhibitors for protein kinases were dissolved in Me2SO as a stock solution at the following concentrations and stored at −20 °C until use: calmidazolium, KN93, and KN92, 50 mm; U0126 and U0124, 10 mm; and H89, 10 mm. The solutions were diluted in ACSF just prior to use at the following concentrations: calmidazolium, KN93, and KN92, 50 μm; U0126 and U0124, 10 μm; and H89, 5 μm. KT5720 was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 1 mm as a stock solution and then diluted in ACSF at a concentration of 1 μm. The slices were treated with these solutions before and during the recording periods, as described in the figure legends. After the electrophysiological recordings, slices were transferred to a plastic Petri dish cooled on ice, and the CA1 areas were dissected out, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until the biochemical assay. Hippocampal slice samples were homogenized in 300 μl of the homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mmEDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.075 mm pepstatin A, 0.05 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 nm calyculin A, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (TMA11 rotor; TOMY, Tokyo, Japan) for 10 min. CaMKIV was immunoprecipitated with an anti-CaMKIV polyclonal antibody (21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and then CaMKIV activity was measured using peptide-γ as a substrate, as reported previously (20Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The data were compared between the HFS-applied sample and the control at each time point. Hippocampal slice samples were homogenized in 100 μl of homogenizing buffer, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (TMA11 rotor) for 10 min and then mixed with Laemmli's sample buffer (final concentrations, 63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% glycerol, and 0.0083% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 70 V for 3 h using a Trans Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) in a cold room (4 °C). After blocking for 1 h at room temperature with TTBS solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the first antibody diluted with TTBS/bovine serum albumin (anti-pT196 (21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 1:100; anti-active MAPK, 1:500; anti-pCREB, 1:200; anti-CaMKIV (21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 1:1000; anti-CREB, 1:200; anti-ERK2, 1:500; and anti-c-Fos (Ab-2), 1:500). Bound antibodies were visualized with 125I-protein A (0.1 mCi/ml) and analyzed by a Bioimaging Analyzer FLA-2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan), or with an ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image program. After the electrophysiological experiments, the slices were fixed at 4 °C overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Slices of 50-μm thickness were prepared from 450-μm thick slices in Tris-azide buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.01% sodium azide) using a tissue slicer, Vibratome 1000 (Pelco International, Redding). The thin slices were incubated in Tris-azide buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with the first antibody (anti-pT196, 1:200). Bound antibodies were visualized using FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and analyzed by laser confocal microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Quantification of nuclear CaMKIV phosphorylation was performed as follows. The intensities of the nuclear and cytosolic fluorescence of neurons with FITC were compared in 35–40 neurons, using the Image program, that are located in a 100 × 100-μm area between the stimulation and recording electrodes in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. The number of the neurons in which the intensities of the nuclei are brighter than those of the cytosols was counted. Neurons, which have higher intensities in the nuclei, were defined as positive. The independent experiments of different hippocampal slices were performed four times, and statistical analysis was made. The values are the means ± S.E. Comparison between two experimental groups was made by the unpaired Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance with Sheffe's correction was used, andp values of < 0.05 were considered to have statistical significance. We first examined the changes of CaMKIV activity during LTP. Application of HFS to Schaffer-collateral pathways reliably induced the potentiation of fEPSP slope, which lasts over 60 min in the CA1 region (166 ± 17% of base line at 60 min after HFS; Fig.1 A). CaMKIV activity was determined 3, 10, 30, and 60 min after HFS application and was significantly increased within 3 min (201 ± 12% of control) and 10 min (127 ± 13% of control), returning to basal levels within 30 min after HFS (Fig. 1 B). This result was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using the anti-pT196 antibody (21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to assess levels of CaMKIV phosphorylation at Thr196 (Fig. 1 C), an essential site for activation of CaMKIV by CaMK kinase. This result is summarized by statistical analysis in Fig. 1 D. Phosphorylation of Thr196 was significantly increased 3 min after HFS (226 ± 44% of control) and then returned to the basal level. CaMKIV protein levels were unchanged 3, 10, and 30 min after HFS, although a slight but significant increase (118 ± 7.6% of control; n = 6, p < 0.05) was observed 60 min after HFS and is consistent with the previously reported result (29Tokuda M. Ahmed B.Y. Lu Y.-F. Matsui M. Miyamoto O. Yamaguchi F. Konishi R. Hatase O. Brain Res. 1997; 755: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also examined the phosphorylation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) and CREB, and phosphorylation of both was detected with phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 1 C, summarized in Fig.1 D). Phosphorylation of p42 MAPK was significantly increased 3 min after HFS (180 ± 15% of control) and then returned to basal levels. Because HFS selectively activated p42 MAPK but not p44 MAPK, changes in phosphorylation of p42MAPK were examined in the present study. This result is consistent with the previous reports (7Liu J. Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Nishi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19103-19106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) that activity of p42 MAPK is transiently increased by HFS in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. In contrast, CREB phosphorylation detected with an anti-phosho-Ser133 antibody increased 3 min (151 ± 14% of control), 10 min (132 ± 10% of control), 30 min (151 ± 24% of control), and 60 min (169 ± 29% of control) after HFS, and the increased phosphorylation was sustained during LTP (Fig. 1 D). Although the total amounts of p42 MAPK were unchanged 3 and 10 min after HFS, a slight but significant increase was observed 30 min (116 ± 6.2% of control;n = 7) and 60 min (121 ± 5.9% of control;n = 6) after HFS (p < 0.05). The protein levels of CREB were not significantly changed at any time point after HFS (data not shown). To determine the localization of activated CaMKIV in neurons, we undertook an immunohistochemical study using the anti-pT196 antibody. In control slices, moderate immunoreactivity was observed in the cytosol (Fig. 2 A) but was not competed by absorbance with the peptide antigen (21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 C), indicating that it was nonspecific. The strong nonspecific immunoreactivity in the cytosol would probably mask any small amount of CaMKIV activation in the cytosol. Neuronal nuclei were not stained (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, strong immunoreactivity was observed in the nuclei of neurons in HFS-applied slices (Fig.2 B), and that immunoreactivity was absent when the antibody was absorbed with the peptide antigen (Fig. 2 C), indicating that it was specific. Although the antibody used in the present study was specific, it seems sometimes that the antibody lacks specificity against nondenatured protein immunocytochemistry. Therefore, the detected immunoreactivity may be called CaMKIV-like immunoreactivity. These results suggest that CaMKIV is activated in the nuclei of CA1 pyramidal neurons by HFS application. Specific immunoreactivity was also observed in the dendrites of neurons (Fig.2 B), because its expression was not limited to nuclei (19Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We observed slight expression of CaMKIV in the cytosols and dendrites of cultured neurons (data not shown). Because it was reported that the major CREB kinase was CaMKIV in response to neuronal stimulation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (25Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), we addressed whether CaMKIV functioned as a CREB kinase during LTP. To inhibit CaMKIV activity, we used calmidazolium, a calmodulin antagonist, and KN93, a CaMK inhibitor. Both inhibitors have been previously shown to inhibit CaMKIV activity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (20Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The application of calmidazolium (Fig. 3 A) or KN93 (Fig. 3 D) inhibited induction of LTP, possibly by inhibiting CaMKII (6Fukunaga K. Muller D. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7Liu J. Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Nishi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calmidazolium (n = 7) and KN93 (n = 8) did significantly inhibit CaMKIV phosphorylation without any effect on p42 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3,B and E). HFS-induced CREB phosphorylation was, however, significantly inhibited by both compounds 3 and 30 min after HFS (Fig. 3, B, C, E, andF). By contrast, KN92, an inactive compound similar to KN93, affected neither LTP induction nor CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3,D and F), indicating specific inhibition by KN93. These results demonstrate a positive correlation between CaMKIV activation and CREB phosphorylation and are consistent with the idea that CaMKIV functions as a CREB kinase during HFS-induced LTP. We next examined the effect of MAPK on HFS-induced CREB phosphorylation. The MAPK cascade is thought to be involved in CREB phosphorylation through the activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) (31Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). We previously reported that a high concentration of PD098059, an MEK inhibitor, inhibited LTP induction (7Liu J. Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Nishi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of this inhibitor was positively correlated with inactivation of CaMKII, and therefore we concluded that PD098059 inhibited LTP through inactivation of CaMKII rather than MAPK (7Liu J. Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Nishi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effect of U0126 (32Favata M. Horiuch K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar), which specifically inhibits MEK at a lower concentration than PD098059. Under the conditions used, U0126 did not affect the induction of HFS-induced LTP (Fig.4 A), a finding consistent with other reports (33Winder D.G. Martin K.C. Muzzio I.A. Rohrer D. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 34Watabe A.M. Zaki P.A. O'Dell T.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5924-5931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μm U0126 dramatically inhibited p42 MAPK phosphorylation without any effect on CaMKIV phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). To further inhibit p42 MAPK, 20 and 30 μm U0126 was used, and inhibition of CaMKIV phosphorylation was not observed. On the other hand, CREB phosphorylation was not inhibited 3 min after HFS but was significantly inhibited 30 min after HFS (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that not only CaMKIV but also MAPK pathways function as CREB kinases in HFS-induced LTP. It should be noted that CaMKIV functions as a CREB kinase at a relatively early stage of HFS-induced LTP, whereas MAPK functions at a later point during the time course. We examined the effects of H89 and KT5720, inhibitors for PKA, on HFS-induced CREB phosphorylation, because PKA can directly phosphorylate and activate CREB. In our experimental conditions, H89 and KT5720 did not inhibit HFS-induced LTP in the CA1 region (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the mossy fiber CA3 LTP was reduced by PKA inhibitors (Fig. 5B), as previously reported (35Huang Y.-Y. Li X.-C. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 79: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), indicating that these inhibitors were active under our experimental conditions. Because H89 has been shown to have nonspecific effects on other kinases than PKA, compared with KT5720, we checked its effect on CaMKIV and MAPK phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.5 C, H89 had no effect on CaMKIV and MAPK phosphorylation. CREB phosphorylation was inhibited neither by H89 nor by KT5720 during LTP in the CA1 region (Fig. 5 C). The results for CREB phosphorylation are summarized in Fig. 5 D. Neither of the PKA inhibitors inhibited CREB phosphorylation induced by LTP at 3 and 30 min after HFS in the CA1 region. These results suggest that the PKA pathway is involved neither in HFS-induced LTP nor in CREB phosphorylation at an early stage and are consistent with the previous report (36Qi M. Zhuo M. Skålhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To address whether CREB phosphorylation induced by HFS stimulates gene expression, we examined the expression of the c-Fos protein, one of the markers for cyclic AMP-responsive element promoter-mediated gene expression (37Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The expression of the c-Fos protein was unchanged 3 and 10 min after LTP induction and then significantly increased 30 (115 ± 10% of control) and 60 (153 ± 13% of control) min after LTP induction (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that the phosphorylated CREB stimulated c-Fos expression. We further tested whether c-Fos expression was regulated by CaMKIV and/or MAPK pathways during LTP. The increase in c-Fos expression at 60 min after HFS was inhibited by the addition of calmidazolium or U0126 (Fig.6 B). Treatment of hippocampal slices with calmidazolium strongly inhibited the HFS-induced c-Fos expression, whereas treatment with U0126 moderately but significantly inhibited c-Fos expression (Fig. 6 B). The extent of inhibition by calmidazolium and U0126 was positively correlated with levels of CREB phosphorylation shown in Figs. 3 and 4. These results suggest that both CaMKIV and MAPK function as CREB kinases, which in turn regulate CREB-mediated gene expression in HFS-induced LTP. Here we show that CaMKIV is activated accompanied with phosphorylation of Thr196 with CREB phosphorylation and stimulation of c-Fos expression during LTP. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that CaMKIV is activated and involved in stimulation of gene expression during LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region. The activation of CaMKIV shown in Fig. 1 was transient and returned to the original level in a short time. This activation pattern differed from that of CaMKII, which showed a long lasting activation during LTP (5Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fukunaga K. Muller D. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, the difference in activation patterns of CaMKII (21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IV (21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was also observed in cultured hippocampal neurons in response to glutamate receptor stimulation. Because transient activation of CaMKIV was also reported in Jurkat T cells (22Park I.-K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30464-30469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) in response to T cell receptor stimulation, it may be common in most cell types. One explanation for the difference in activation of CaMKII and CaMKIV may be that the latter is dephosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin; Ref. 21Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas CaMKII cannot be dephosphorylated directly by calcineurin (39Goto S. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Iwasa T. Matsukado Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is required to activate CaMKIV. Such elevation activates calcineurin, which may rapidly dephosphorylate and inactivate phosphorylated CaMKIV, which differs from the persistent activation of CaMKII. Although activation of CaMKIV was transient, the present study suggests that CaMKIV acts as a CREB kinase. Experiments with a calmodulin antagonist and protein kinase inhibitors demonstrated that CaMKs are mainly involved in phosphorylation of CREB, with a slight phosphorylation by MAPK, and that PKA has no effect on phosphorylation of CREB. Among CaMKs, the contribution of CaMKII to CREB phosphorylation may be excluded, because c-Fos expression was stimulated during LTP in the present study, and phosphorylation of CREB by CaMKII reportedly had inhibitory effects on gene expression (40Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These results were consistent with a recent report (26Ho N. Liauw J.A. Blaeser F. Wei F. Hanissian S. Muglia L.M. Wozniak D.F. Nardi A. Arvin K.L. Holtzman D.M. Linden D.J. Zhuo M. Muglia L.J. Chatila T.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that showed reduced CREB phosphorylation and no significant potentiation of fEPSP at 45 min after LTP in hippocampal slices of CaMKIV-deficient mice with normally expressed CaMKII. On the other hand, the c-fospromoter the contains cyclic AMP-responsive element and other motifs such as the serum response element. Because the serum response element was reported to be involved in activation of c-fos promoter by CaMKII (41Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), stimulation of c-Fos protein expression may also occur during LTP. Because we have no selective inhibitors for CaMK subtypes, it was not possible to identify which subtypes of CaMK are involved in HFS-induced stimulation of c-Fos protein expression. Involvement of MAPK cascade in hippocampal LTP (7Liu J. Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Nishi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5924-5931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and learning and memory (42Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) was recently reported. Consistent with these reports, we confirmed that MAPK was transiently activated in CA1 LTP. It should be noted that MAPK seems to function as a CREB kinase at a later stage of LTP, although MAPK activation was transient. Although CaMKIV and MAPK are transiently activated, such activation in the context of a signaling cascade would be sufficient to trigger changes in gene expression. CaMKIV can directly phosphorylate CREB, which may enable CaMKIV to function as a CREB kinase at a relatively early stage in LTP. MAPK phosphorylates RSK2, which in turn phosphorylates CREB, and the time lag required for the signal transduction to occur may be too great to allow the MAPK cascade to function as a CREB kinase at an early rather than a late stage of LTP. Because c-Fos expression observed 60 min after HFS was inhibited by both inhibitors for CaMKIV and MAPK, activation of both enzymes observed during LTP is enough to be involved in gene expression. To form long term memory, newly synthesized synaptic components and the formation of a new circuit such as morphologically changed spines may be required (43Lüscher C. Nicoll A. Malenka R.C. Muller D. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). This indicates that the stimulation of gene expression and consequent protein synthesis are needed for the formation of memory. In view of the observation on CREB phosphorylation and stimulation of c-Fos expression by CaMKIV and MAPK in the present study, activation of both enzymes may be associated with LTP maintenance and memory formation. Recent reports showed that PKA is activated during LTP in the CA1 region (44Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and is involved in the late phase of LTP (45Frey U. Huang Y.-Y. Kandel E.R.

These reports differed from results presented here, because the PKA inhibitors had no effect on LTP induction and CREB phosphorylation. These discrepancies could be due to several reasons. First, there were differences in conditions used to induce LTP in ours and previous studies. In the previous studies, more than twice repetitive 100 Hz trains with 5–10-min intervals (44Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 45Frey U. Huang Y.-Y. Kandel E.R.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5924-5931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas here, LTP induced by two trains of 100 Hz stimulation with a 20-s interval was not inhibited by these inhibitors (33Winder D.G. Martin K.C. Muzzio I.A. Rohrer D. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). There is no doubt that conditional changes in the experiments would bring about different results. Second, other reports showed that PKA is involved in LTP maintenance 3 h after HFS but not involved in LTP induction (36Qi M. Zhuo M. Skålhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 45Frey U. Huang Y.-Y. Kandel E.R. Science. 1993; 260: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Because the effect of a PKA inhibitor was examined at the early stage of LTP in the present study, the results were consistent with these reports. Third, it has been reported that protein phosphatases, especially protein phosphatase 1, are involved in LTP induction in the PKA pathway (47Blitzer R.D. Connor J.H. Brown G.P. Wong T. Shenolikar S. Iyenger R. Landau E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1940-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions, however, it seems that PKA may not be activated, because the PKA inhibitors had no effect on HFS-induced LTP and CREB phosphorylation. In other words, phosphorylation of inhibitor 1 by PKA may not have occurred under the conditions of the present study. In conclusion, the present study showed that CaMKIV activation was associated with LTP induction and had a positive correlation to CREB phosphorylation and up-regulation of c-Fos expression. Further study will be required to clarify how the actual targets of CaMKIV and MAPK function to alter gene expression required to form long lasting memory. We thank Dr. J.

We report here that a deletion of the extreme C terminus of c-Abl (ΔF-actin c-Abl) can partially restore kinase activity to c-Abl from detached cells. Because the extreme C terminus of c-Abl contains a consensus F-actin binding motif, we investigated the effect of F-actin on c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. We found that F-actin can inhibit the kinase activity of purified c-Abl protein. Mutations of the extreme C-terminal region of c-Abl disrupted both the binding of c-Abl to F-actin and the inhibition of c-Abl by F-actin. Mutations of the SH3, SH2, and DNA binding domains did not abolish the inhibition of c-Abl kinase by F-actin. Catalytic domain substitutions that affect the regulation of c-Abl by the retinoblastoma protein or the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase also did not abolish the inhibition of c-Abl by F-actin.

In proliferating cells, c-Abl is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, in a dynamic equilibrium between nuclear import and export (1Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase is cell cycle-regulated. Following the G1/S transition, the nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase can also be activated by DNA damage (2Baskaran R. Wood L. Whitaker L. Canman C. Morgan S. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Conversely, the cytoplasmic c-Abl tyrosine kinase is not cell cycle-regulated (8Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5542-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), nor is it activated by DNA damage (4Liu Z. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E. Wood L. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, the cytoplasmic c-Abl is regulated by cell adhesion (9Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Detachment of fibroblasts from the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 leads to a reduction in the overall activity of c-Abl. Reattachment to ECM proteins, such as fibronectin, causes a rapid reactivation of c-Abl kinase, and this higher level of c-Abl kinase activity is maintained in attached cells (9Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Like the Src family of tyrosine kinases, c-Abl contains an SH3 and an SH2 Src homology domain, as well as a linker that connects the SH2 domain to the catalytic domain. The SH2 linker of c-Abl contains a proline sequence that can interact intramolecularly with the SH3 domain thereby anchoring the catalytic domain in an inactive conformation (10Barilá D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Deletion of the c-Abl SH3 domain or point mutations within the SH2 linker results in an increased c-Abl kinase activity in vivo, unmasking the transforming potential of the c-Abl kinase (10Barilá D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Franz W. Berger P. Wang J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Clearly, the SH3 domain is an important regulatory region in c-Abl, but because the expression of ΔSH3-Abl requires levels at least 10-fold higher than the endogenous c-Abl to transform (12Franz W. Berger P. Wang J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3941-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), SH3-independent mechanisms likely contribute to the oncogenic conversion of c-Abl. Indeed, several SH3-independent mechanisms have been reported to regulate c-Abl (2Baskaran R. Wood L. Whitaker L. Canman C. Morgan S. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M. Wang J.

However, it is unclear how each Abl domain may contribute to c-Abl kinase regulation by the physiological stimuli reported to activate c-Abl in vivo (20Van Etten R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Immediately C-terminal to the catalytic domain of c-Abl is an extended region not present in the Src family members. This C-terminal region consists of a proline-rich sequence that binds several adapter proteins (17Smith J.M. Katz S. Mayer B.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22823-22830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and finally a region that interacts with both G-actin and F-actin (25Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Sanders M.C. Matsudaira P.T. Janmey P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The F-actin binding function is mapped to the extreme C terminus of c-Abl, which contains a consensus F-actin binding motif found in proteins such as α-actinin and fimbrin (26McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The C-terminal functional domains have not been linked to the regulation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity in previous studies. We have found that F-actin inhibits c-Abl activity in vitroand that the inhibition requires the C-terminal actin binding region of c-Abl. Consistent with this, the ΔF-actin c-Abl mutant has increased kinase activity when expressed in cells. Moreover, detached cells retained nearly full Abl kinase activity with the deletion of the F-actin binding region, whereas deletion or substitution of other regions of c-Abl had no effect on the decrease in kinase activity observed in detached cells. The c-Abl cDNA was murine type IV. The following deletions or substitutions of wild type c-Abl have been previously described: kinsae-defective c-Abl, ΔSH3, AS1, AS2, S465E, ΔDNA (2Baskaran R.

Two ΔF-actin c-Abl DNA constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). One is deletion of amino acids 1111–1142 and the other is a deletion of amino acids 1139–1142; both were constructed by inserting STOP codons immediately following residue 1111 or 1139, respectively. Both deletions have been previously shown to disrupt Abl binding to F-actin (25Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Sanders M.C. Matsudaira P.T. Janmey P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). All constructs used for transfection contained a FLAG epitope tag, with the 8-amino acid FLAG sequence, flanked by three glycine residues on either side, being inserted internally between the DNA and actin binding domains of c-Abl at the unique SalI site. The FLAG tag did not affect adhesion regulation of c-Abl kinase as determined by side by side analysis with either endogenous c-Abl or transfected c-Abl without a FLAG sequence insert (data not shown and Ref. 30Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For expression, the various c-Abl DNA constructs were cloned into the MSCV-hph retroviral expression plasmid (31Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). The stable Abl-deficient fibroblast cell line Abl−/− was a generous gift from Dr. Rubio Ren. Abl−/− cells and c-Abl reconstituted Abl−/− cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. 10T1/2 cells and 293T Bosc cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Stable cell lines expressing individual c-Abl constructs were obtained through retroviral mediated gene transfer using retrovirus produced from transfected Bosc cells (31Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). Infected Abl−/− cells were selected with hygromycin for 7–12 days, and a polyclonal population of hygromycin-resistant cells was obtained and used for subsequent analysis. Monoclonal populations of cells were selected from the polyclonal pools using cloning cylinders and then subsequently performing single cell dilutions to ensure that each cell line was established from a single cell. The expression levels of c-Abl decreased over time and were comparable to endogenous levels found in NIH 3T3 cells after 8–12 weeks in culture. Cells used for the adhesion regulation studies contained levels of c-Abl no greater than 4-fold 3T3 endogenous levels. Detached cells were prepared by serum starvation (0.1% fetal bovine serum, 24 h) followed by trypsinization and then held in suspension for 40–60 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 500 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% BSA (9Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Attached cells were prepared by replating the detached cells onto fibronectin-coated dishes (50 µg/ml fibronectin) for 40–60 min. Detached cells were collected by centrifugation and attached cells by scraping in ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors: aprotinin, leupeptin, phenanthroline, benzamidine HCl, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitors: sodium orthovanadate, β-glycerophosphate). Lysates were sonicated briefly and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Under these conditions, ∼85% of c-Abl and 86% of actin were recovered in the supernatant of lysates from both attached and detached cells. Much higher g forces (100,000 × g) were required to pellet the F-actin, which was not cross-linked in networks (see “F-actin Polymerization and F-actin Binding Assay”). Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 2–4 h at 4 °C using 500 µg of cell lysate and antibody coupled to either protein A-Sepharose (anti-K12, Santa Cruz) or protein G-Sepharose (anti-8E9 (Pharmingen), anti-Ab-3 (Oncogene Sciences), and anti-FLAG (Sigma) monoclonal antibodies). Other monoclonal antibodies used for Western blotting included anti-pTyr 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-actin (Sigma). For kinase assays, immunoprecipitations were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer. The final Sepharose pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1–4 µg of substrate. The addition of 20 µm ATP and 50 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP initiated the kinase reactions. After 30–40 min of shaking at room temperature, reactions were stopped by the addition of boiling SDS sample buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed (4–15% gradient or 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels), and then proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were stained with Amido Black to reveal substrate position and then exposed to film to reveal radioactivity incorporated into substrate. The quantity of32P incorporation into substrate was then determined by PhosphorImager analysis using kinase-defective c-Abl as a negative control. The same membranes were reactivated with methanol, and Western analysis with the 8E9, or Ab-3 c-Abl antibody was performed to determine the quantity of c-Abl in each kinase reaction. (Although K12 and FLAG antibodies recognize all of our Abl proteins in the immunoprecipitates, they did not recognize Abl on immunoblots.) Since the epitope for 8E9 is not present in AS1 Abl and the epitope for Ab-3 is not present in ΔF-actin protein we first did Western analysis with the 8E9 antibody then stripped the blots and subsequently used Ab-3 as the detecting antibody. To calculate the amount of Abl protein per lane, we used the kinase-defective and wild type c-Abl protein levels as internal controls to set the ECL signal as equal between Westerns performed with different antibodies. c-Abl concentration was quantified using a charge-coupled device camera and software provided by Alpha Inotech. The specific activity of c-Abl was calculated by dividing the substrate 32P incorporation (PhosphorImager) by the amount of c-Abl protein in each immunoprecipitation (c-Abl Western). To be sure the signal we detected in our kinase reactions was due to phosphotyrosine, membranes were reactivated with methanol then soaked in 1 m KOH for 2 h at 55 °C to reduce any background serine phosphorylation. Membranes were then re-exposed and compared with the original exposure. Using this method, we confirmed that the signal was exclusively due to phosphotyrosine. For P81 experiments the kinase reaction was performed under the same conditions with 4 µl of the purified c-Abl in place of the immunoprecipitated c-Abl. To stabilize low concentrations of purified protein, we included 5–10 µm BSA in all kinase reactions containing purified c-Abl. (BSA was not phosphorylated by c-Abl.) Reactions were terminated by pipetting onto P81 cation exchange paper and immediately dropping into 50 mm NaCl solution. P81 paper was washed for 15 min in 0.1% phosphoric acid with two changes of buffer and then rinsed in 50 mm NaCl.32P incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. For purified c-Abl kinase reactions it was determined that P81 analysis gave identical results as the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Western analysis described above. FLAG-c-Abl was purified using the anti-M2FLAG resin (Sigma). 100 million cells were lysed in 20 ml of high salt Triton lysis buffer (750 mm NaCl) and briefly sonicated on ice. Lysate was rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, and detergent-insoluble proteins were removed by high speed ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). Cleared supernatant was rotated for 2–3 h with 1 ml of anti-FLAG resin. Resin was washed with 30 ml of high salt lysis buffer then 5 ml of TBS, pH 8. Bound proteins were eluted with 200 µg/ml FLAG peptide in TBS containing 20% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Peak fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The FLAG peptide did not affect the binding of Abl to F-actin or the inhibition of Abl by F-actin as determined by dialyzing the FLAG peptide from purified Abl. To stabilize Abl at low concentrations, we added the 1 µm BSA directly to the Abl preparation. The BSA buffer did not affect purified c-Abl activity after dilution into kinase reactions. GST-tagged proteins were purified as previously described: GST-CTD (CTD, last 384 amino acids of murine C-terminal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II), GST-CrkCTD (Crk-CTD, 218–224 of Crk fused to the last 31 amino acids of CTD) (32Baskaran R.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, 20% glycerol overnight and then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. F-actin was purified to homogeneity from rabbit skeletal muscle by Drs. Harry Higgs and Laurent Blanchoin (Dr. Tom Pollard's laboratory). Fibronectin was purified by Dr. Mark Renshaw as previously described (9Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). F-actin polymerization was carried out according to Pollard laboratory recommendations (34Freeman J. De La Cruz E. Pollard T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Purified actin was polymerized at 25 µm at 25 °C for 1 h. The final buffer (G buffer with 1× KMEI) containing the F-actin consisted of: 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Buffers containing equivalent amounts of BSA were used as controls. To prevent quenching of the kinase reactions with excess cold ATP from the polymerization buffer, the polymerized F-actin and control BSA buffer were passed over a Dowex AG column, previously equilibrated to pH 7.5. (We also performed kinase assays by adding equivalent ATP to the control BSA buffer instead of passing over the Dowex AG resin. This method required longer exposure of autoradiograms but gave similar results.) Typically, the F-actin was diluted 10-fold or more into the kinase reactions or binding reactions to give a final concentration of 50 nm to 3 µm. For reactions containing less than 0.3 µm actin, phalloidin (Sigma) was added to the polymerized F-actin at a concentration equal to the actin before dilution. Phalloidin did not affect the binding of Abl to F-actin. For F-actin sedimentation assays, we used 1× polymerization buffer containing 10 µm BSA as the binding buffer. Abl was incubated with F-actin for 15 min at room temperature. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 20 min at 100,000 ×g to pellet the F-actin. Because we observed some nonspecific binding of c-Abl to the polycarbonate centrifuge tubes, we incubated all tubes with the BSA buffer overnight. Pellets were washed in 1× KMEI before solubilization and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have previously demonstrated that c-Abl kinase activity is reduced when fibroblasts are detached from the ECM (9Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase by cell adhesion, we examined a panel of c-Abl mutants for their activity in attached and detached fibroblasts. Each c-Abl protein was expressed in Abl-deficient (Abl−/−) 3T3 cells established from Abl−/− mice using retroviral mediated gene transfer. This gave a level of c-Abl expression approximately equal to that of endogenous c-Abl after selection (see “Experimental Procedures”). c-Abl was immunoprecipitated with the K12 antibody (directed against amino acids 521–531, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) from either attached or detached cells to determine kinase activity. The kinase activity of wild type c-Abl when reconstituted into Abl−/− background was regulated by the adherent status of these cells (Fig.1). Using GST fusions of the C-terminal repeat domain of RNA polymerase II (CTD) or Crk-CTD as a specific substrate (5Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that the activity of c-Abl isolated from attached cells was 4–5-fold higher than that from detached cells. The observed kinase activity toward CTD or Crk-CTD was specific to c-Abl, because a KD c-Abl mutant showed only background activity that was the same in attached or detached cells. The 4–5-fold reduction in c-Abl activity caused by cell detachment is similar to the regulation we have previously reported for the endogenous Abl found in fibroblast cells (9Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and is also consistent with a previous report in which the anti-FLAG antibody was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged c-Abl and paxillin was utilized as the substrate for c-Abl kinase (30Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The presence of the inserted FLAG tag within these constructs did not affect the activity or regulation by adhesion, consistent with these previous findings (30Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The activity of each construct in attached and detached cells was consistent (relative to KD c-Abl) regardless of whether we used polyclonal or monoclonal populations of cells selected for Abl expression. These results demonstrated that the adhesion regulation of c-Abl activity could be reconstituted in Abl−/− cells and thus allowed a series of c-Abl mutants to be tested in this system. As summarized in Fig. 1, we examined three deletion mutants (ΔSH3, ΔDNA, and ΔF-actin) and four substitution mutants (KD, S465E, AS1, and AS2) for their kinase activity in attached and detached cells. The c-Abl kinase activity for the kinase-defective c-Abl immunoprecipitated from detached cells was independently set at 1, and the values summarized in Fig. 1 are the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. The activity of five of the seven c-Abl mutants, ΔSH3, AS1, AS2, S465E, and ΔDNA, was regulated by cell adhesion, with kinase activity falling 4–5-fold upon cell detachment. The activity of the ΔSH3 mutant was assayed in polyclonal cells that were not transformed. Stable or transient expression of the ΔSH3 mutant in the Abl−/− cells did not result in transformation because the level of expression was not high enough (12Franz W. Berger P. Wang J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and because the Abl−/− cells are predominantly “N” 3T3 cells, which cannot be transformed by Abl (14Renshaw M.W. Kipreos E.T. Albrecht M.R. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3941-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Renshaw M.W. McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1286-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells ΔSH3 c-Abl had kinase activity comparable to that of wild type c-Abl, and this activity was reduced upon cell detachment. The AS1 c-Abl mutant is a substitution of the SH2 domain with the analogous SH2 region in c-Src. The AS2 c-Abl mutant is a substitution of the c-Abl ATP binding lobe with the analogous region in c-Src, which thereby prevents inhibition by the retinoblastoma (RB) protein (15Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Both of these substitutions resulted in a c-Abl that showed reduced activity upon cell detachment similar to wild type c-Abl. The substitution of Ser465, the phosphorylation site for ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase, to either glutamic acid (S465E) or alanine (S465A), which abolishes regulation by DNA damage (2Baskaran R.

Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), also did not affect the regulation by adhesion. Likewise, deletion of two of the three high mobility group-like boxes that comprise the DNA binding domain (24Miao Y. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22823-22830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) did not affect the regulation of c-Abl activity by cell adhesion. Thus, the adhesion regulation of c-Abl kinase occurs through a novel mechanism that is distinct from the previously identified regulation of c-Abl kinase through its SH3 domain (11Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Franz W. Berger P. Wang J.

It is also known as STAT-inducible STAT inhibitor-1 (SSI-1) (2Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T.

SOCS-1 defines a family of eight proteins, SOCS-1 to -7 and CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein), each of which contains a central SH2 domain and a C-terminal SOCS box (4Hilton D.J.

In vitro studies have shown that the expression of SOCS-1, -2, -3, and CIS is inducible by a number of cytokines and that, when constitutively overexpressed, each SOCS protein can act to switch off cytokine-induced responses by inhibiting the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway (1Starr R.

The latter studies are difficult to interpret because not only are the SOCS proteins grossly overexpressed, but they are also expressed in a temporally inappropriate manner, being present prior to the onset of signaling rather than induced as a consequence of signal transduction, which occurs physiologically.

Although the primary defect in mice lacking SOCS-3 has not been defined, the fatal neonatal disease characteristic of SOCS-1-deficient mice requires IFNγ, because this pathology does not develop in SOCS-1-deficient mice that also lack the IFNγ gene (13Alexander W.S.

The predominant function of interferons is to confer cellular resistance to viral infections, although other immunomodulatory functions have also been described (14Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar). IFNγ is produced by activated T lymphocytes and natural killer cells during viral infections and initiates an antiviral program in target cells by up-regulating the expression of genes that mediate the anti-viral response, including those encoding MHC class I antigens (14Boehm U.

Elevated levels of IFNγ can be toxic, and it is clear that both IFNγ production and responses to this cytokine must be tightly regulated in order to achieve a balance between beneficial and harmful effects (19Gresser I.

Other cytokines including IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 contribute to some extent to this regulation by antagonizing IFNγ functions (22Moore K.W. O'Garra A. de Waal Malefyt R. Vieira P. Mosmann T.R. Annu.

In addition, negative regulators such as SOCS proteins act to limit signal transduction in response to IFNγ. At least in vitro, SOCS-1 expression is induced by IFNγ and overexpression of SOCS-1 inhibits IFNγ signaling (6Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Ohtsubo M. Ohtsuka A.

For biological studies, neonatal mice were given daily intraperitoneal injections of 3, 0.3, or 0 μg recombinant murine IFNγ (rmIFNγ, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) in 0.05 ml of saline from birth and were sacrificed when moribund or at 21 days of age. For biochemical studies, adult mice weighing an average of 29 g were given a single intraperitoneal injection of either 0.2 ml of saline, 2 μg of rmIFNγ (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or 10 μg of recombinant murine IL-6 (a gift from Dr. Richard Simpson, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne, Australia). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the indicated times after injection. Livers were dissected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Frozen livers were pulverized with a hammer and homogenized in RIPA buffer (1% v/v Triton X-100, 1% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% w/v SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Auspep, Parkville, Australia), 1 mm iodoacetic acid, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EGTA (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 1 mm pervanadate. Pervanadate was prepared by adding hydrogen peroxide (20 mm final) to 1 mmsodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein content was quantitated using a Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford IL). For immunoprecipitations, liver lysates (12–20 mg of protein) were first precleared with protein G-Sepharose (0.060 ml, suspended 1:1 in RIPA buffer; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1.5 h, then incubated with 4 μg of anti-STAT1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and protein G-Sepharose (0.06 ml, suspended 1:1 in RIPA buffer) for 2 h or overnight. Unbound protein was separated from the immunoprecipitate by washing 2–4 times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm iodoacetic acid, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm pervanadate. Bound protein was eluted from the Sepharose in 0.03 ml of 2× SDS loading buffer (115 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.8% (w/v) SDS, 18.2% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Eluates were split prior to SDS-PAGE to allow quantitation of protein loading. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then electrophoretically transferred to PVDF-Plus membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA). Membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk for a minimum of 1 h and then incubated either for 2 h with anti-STAT1 antibody (1:250 dilution, Transduction Laboratories), or overnight with anti-phosphorylated STAT1 antibody (1:500, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Antibody binding was visualized with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse-Ig Fc fragment-specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) and the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Chemical Co.). Results shown are representative of two experiments. Hepatocytes were harvested from 10-week-old mice as described previously (25Bertolino P. Trescol-Biemont M.-C. Rabourdin-Combe C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 221-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were perfused retrogradely via the inferior vena cava using HBSS without calcium and magnesium and then with the same medium containing 0.5 mm EDTA. EDTA was then removed by flushing the liver with HBSS without calcium and magnesium. Hepatocytes were released by perfusing with HBSS without magnesium but containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 0.05% collagenase IV (Sigma). Viable hepatocytes were purified using a Percoll density gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and the resulting cell pellet was washed three times by 50 × g centrifugation in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% v/v fetal calf serum and 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol (RF10 medium). Cells were plated in 10-cm cell culture dishes (Corning, NY) in the same medium at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells per plate and were allowed to adhere overnight at 37 °C. Adherent hepatocytes were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with 5 ng/ml murine IFNγ (PeproTech) in RF10 medium, after which the cytokine was washed from the plates, and the cells were cultured in fresh RF10 at 37 °C for the remainder of the indicated time. Hepatocytes were harvested from the plates using a rubber policeman and were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm pervanadate. Cell pellets were snap frozen on dry ice, and high salt nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Dale T.C. Ali Imam A.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays were performed on 10 μg of nuclear protein using the m67 oligonucleotide as described (27Novak U. Harpur A.G. Paradiso L. Kanagasundaram V. Jaworowski A. Wilks A.F. Hamilton J.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2948-2956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify DNA-binding complexes, protein samples were preincubated with 2 μg of antibody specific for either STAT1 (Transduction Laboratories) or STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) before binding to the oligonucleotide. The neonatal mortality in SOCS-1 knockout mice has been shown to be dependent on IFNγ, because mice lacking functional genes for both SOCS-1 and IFNγ are viable and healthy (13Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W.H. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). We wished to use SOCS-1−/− mice to assess the extent to which SOCS-1 regulates IFNγ signal transduction; however, such studies are complicated by the endogenous production of IFNγ in vitroand in vivo and compounded by the neonatal morbidity and mortality of SOCS-1−/− mice. To overcome these problems we took advantage of the observation that SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− mice, which fail to produce IFNγ, are healthy and survive to adulthood. Previous studies have documented the toxicity of IFNγ when administered to newborn mice (19Gresser I. Aguet M. Morel-Maroger L. Woodrow D. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Guillon J.C. Maury C. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 102: 396-402PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the pathology induced by IFNγ treatment of wild-type mice is similar to that seen in SOCS-1−/− mice (13Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W.H. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The phenotype of SOCS-1−/− mice may be due to increased circulating levels of IFNγ, increased sensitivity of cells to the effects of IFNγ because of unregulated signaling, or a combination of both. To determine whether mice are more sensitive to IFNγ in the absence of SOCS-1, newborn SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of IFNγ. These mice were monitored and were sacrificed when moribund. Mice lacking SOCS-1 were substantially more sensitive to the toxicity of IFNγ. Injections of 3 μg of IFNγ induced morbidity within 2 days in SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− mice, whereas this dose was tolerated for ∼3 weeks in SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− mice (Fig.1). Differences in sensitivity were also seen in response to the administration of 0.3 μg of IFNγ. In contrast to SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/− mice, which were all moribund by 3 weeks of age and developed the same pathological features as SOCS-1−/− mice (Fig. 1 and data not shown), SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− mice all remained healthy after receiving this dose of IFNγ (Fig. 1). To assess whether SOCS-1 regulates the intensity or duration of responses to IFNγ, the activation of downstream signaling molecules was assessed in mice lacking SOCS-1. The organ we chose to examine in these studies was the liver because it is severely affected both in SOCS-1−/− mice and in mice injected with IFNγ. SOCS-1−/− IFNγ−/−, SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/−, and SOCS-1+/+IFNγ+/+ mice were given intraperitoneal injections of IFNγ and the subsequent activation of STAT1 in the liver was monitored at various times thereafter. STAT1 phosphorylation was evident in all mice within 15 min of IFNγ injection, with the response continuing for at least 2 h but declining to basal levels by 4 h in SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ+/+ mice (Fig.2 A). However, phosphorylation of STAT1 was prolonged in mice lacking SOCS-1 and was maintained until 8 h after injection. This prolonged response was specific to IFNγ, because there was no difference in the kinetics of STAT1 or STAT3 phosphorylation induced by IL-6 in mice lacking SOCS-1 (Fig.2 B and data not shown). SOCS-1 appeared to be important for regulating the duration of the response to IFNγ, but not the intensity, because peak levels of STAT1 phosphorylation did not differ substantially between mice of different genotypes. The in vivo experiments described above indicate a role for SOCS-1 in regulating IFNγ-induced responses in the liver but may be complicated by factors such as clearance of IFNγ from the circulation. We therefore wished to examine IFNγ responses in vitro using primary hepatocyte cultures. To assess the sensitivity of hepatocytes to IFNγ, primary hepatocyte cultures were established from SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− and SOCS-1+/+IFNγ−/− mice. Hepatocytes were stimulated for 10 min with a pulse of IFNγ, after which time cytokine was washed from the cells, and the response was allowed to decay over varying periods. Gel shift analysis was used to monitor the DNA binding activity of STAT dimers throughout the time course. In both cell types, the response to IFNγ peaked at 30 min after stimulation. The response decayed rapidly in SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− cells and was virtually undetectable at 2 h poststimulation (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the activity of STAT dimers was prolonged in SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− cells, persisting beyond 3 h after IFNγ treatment (Fig. 3 B). Supershift analyses (Fig. 3 C) identified STAT1 homodimers as the predominant STAT dimers formed in response to IFNγ (Fig. 3,A and B, lower band), with a smaller amount of STAT1/STAT3 homodimers also being activated (Fig. 3, A andB, upper band). Similar to the in vivo studies, only the duration of the response to IFNγ was altered in SOCS-1−/− cells and not the intensity. Other experiments were performed in which hepatocytes were exposed to the stimulus for the entire time course rather than just a pulse. Active STAT dimers persisted for longer in these experiments but did not decay in cells lacking SOCS-1 throughout an 8-h culture period, whereas STAT dimer formation in SOCS-1+/+ IFNγ−/− cells had decayed to a baseline level by 5 h of culture (data not shown). IFNγ is critical for mediating the multiorgan pathology of SOCS-1−/− mice, because mice lacking both SOCS-1 and IFNγ are viable and healthy (13Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W.H. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). However, the specific relationship between SOCS-1 and IFNγ has yet to be defined. Is the phenotype of SOCS-1−/− mice due to increased sensitivity of cells to IFNγ in the absence of SOCS-1 or to increased production of IFNγ? Both appear to contribute to the phenotype. A previous study has shown that circulating levels of IFNγ are increased in mice lacking SOCS-1 (12Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E. Stravopodis D. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The data presented here clearly establish that in the absence of SOCS-1, mice and cells isolated from them are more sensitive to the effects of IFNγ. Neonatal mice lacking SOCS-1 were substantially more sensitive to the toxic effects of administered IFNγ. Further, we have directly established a biochemical basis for this hypersensitivity and have shown that SOCS-1 attenuates signal transduction pathways in vivo, consistent with in vitro data. STAT1 activation was prolonged in the liver of SOCS-1−/−IFNγ−/− mice after injection of IFNγ. This increased sensitivity in vivo was paralleled in vitro by prolonged STAT1 activation in primary hepatocytes in response to IFNγ. Although forced expression of SOCS-1 has been shown to limit the intensity of STAT activation in response to cytokine (1Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J.

Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar), SOCS-1 expression is temporally inappropriate in these studies. In the present study, which relies on more physiological expression, SOCS-1 appears to be important for limiting the duration of responses to cytokine and not the magnitude of the response. This result is consistent with the current model of SOCS action in which SOCS expression is induced by cytokine and then functions to switch off the cytokine-induced signal (1Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). The relative contributions to the SOCS-1−/−phenotype of increased IFNγ production and prolonged IFNγ responses are difficult to delineate. In situations in which IFNγ is limiting, for instance in SOCS-1−/− IFNγ+/− mice, pathological changes including uncontrolled macrophage activation are still evident and may result predominantly from inappropriate and prolonged signaling in response to more normal levels of circulating IFNγ (28Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Elefanty A.G. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Starr R. Mifsud S. Di Rago L. Immunity. 1999; 13: 926-934Google Scholar). Further, serum IFNγ is undetectable in some SOCS-1−/− mice (data not shown). Our data suggest that hypersensitivity to IFNγ may be driving the typical SOCS-1−/− phenotype seen in these mice. Although the JAK/STAT pathway has been well characterized using both primary and continuous cell lines, the kinetics of JAK/STAT activationin vivo following cytokine stimulation has not been comprehensively studied. In the course of this study we have developed assays to monitor the phosphorylation of STATs from mouse liver, resulting in a detailed study of the kinetics of IFNγ signalingin vivo. The phenotype of SOCS-1−/− mice demonstrates a specific non-redundant role for SOCS-1 in determining the rate at which interferon signaling is attenuated. The lack of effect on IL-6 signaling in vivo may indicate that other SOCS proteins can compensate for the absence of SOCS-1 in other cytokine pathways. Whereas IFNγ signaling is clearly prolonged by several hours in SOCS1−/− mice, STAT1 activation is still switched off, albeit later than normal. This residual negative regulation of signal transduction may be mediated by other members of the SOCS family or by other inhibitory mechanisms such as phosphatases (29Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T.

We found that two amino acid substitutions (W3620A,L3624D) resulted in a loss of high affinity CaCaM binding and inhibition of RyR1 by CaCaM (nanomolars). The L3624D substitution also resulted in a loss of apoCaM binding and activation of RyR1 by apoCaM. Portions of this study have been published previously in abstract form (19Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.

Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by treating membranes with a solution, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm KPipes, pH 7.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 100 μm Ca2+ (blocking buffer) for 1 h. CaCaM binding was analyzed by incubating membranes with 100 nm [35S]CaM in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm KPipes, pH 7.0, 0.04% Tween 20, and 100 μm Ca2+ for 1 h and washing with blocking buffer 4 times. Dried membranes were exposed to x-ray film, and radioactivity was determined by autoradiography. ApoCaM binding was analyzed in buffer solutions containing 5 mm EGTA instead of 100 μm Ca2+. Crude membrane fractions prepared as described below were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with solutions, 5 or 15 nm[35S]CaM in 10 mm KPipes, 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 0.125 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm glutathione (reduced form), 20 μm leupeptin, 200 μmPefabloc, and either 5 mm EGTA (apoCaM binding) or 200 μm Ca2+ (CaCaM binding). Aliquots were taken for determination of total radioactivity and centrifuged for 45 min at 30 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge to obtain bound [35S]CaM. Radioactivities were determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding of [35S]CaM was determined by incubating equal protein amounts of vector-transfected or non-transfected HEK293 cells. In parallel experiments, Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined. Membranes were incubated for 5 h at room temperature with a saturating concentration of [3H]ryanodine (30 nm) in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.6 m KCl, 0.15m sucrose, 20 μm leupeptin, 200 μm Pefabloc, and 200 μm Ca2+. Specific [3H]ryanodine binding was determined as described above. The time courses of [35S]CaM binding to and dissociation from skeletal SR vesicles were determined by a filtration assay. To minimize nonspecific binding of [35S]CaM, Whatman GF/B filters were blocked in buffer, 0.15 m KCl, 20 mm KPipes, pH 7.0, containing 10 mg/ml BSA. Vesicles on the filters were washed with three 5 ml of ice-cold buffer, 0.15m KCl, 20 mm KPipes, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 100 μm Ca2+([35S]CaCaM binding and [35S]CaCaM dissociation) or 100 μm EGTA ([35S]apoCaM dissociation). [3H]Ryanodine binding experiments were performed with crude membrane fractions. HEK293 cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.3 msucrose, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm glutathione (oxidized form), Complete protease inhibitors, and 0.1 mm EGTA and homogenized with a Tekmar Tissumizer for 5 s at a setting of 13,500 rpm. Homogenates were centrifuged for 45 min at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti75 rotor, and pellets were resuspended in the above buffer without EGTA and glutathione. Unless otherwise indicated, membranes were incubated with 2.5 nm [3H]ryanodine in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.3 m sucrose, 250 mm KCl, 0.5 mm glutathione (oxidized), 0.25 mg/ml BSA, protease inhibitors, and indicated Ca2+concentrations. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000–2000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. After 20 h, aliquots of the samples were diluted with 8.5 volumes of ice-cold water and placed on Whatman GF/B filters preincubated with 2% polyethyleneimine in water. Filters were washed with three 5 ml of ice-cold 100 mm KCl, 1 mm KPipes, pH 7.0, solution. The radioactivity remaining with the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine. In a previous study, we used 15 fusion proteins spanning the full coding sequence of the RyR1 polypeptide to identify candidate CaM binding domains (10Balshaw, D. M., Xu, L., Yamaguchi, N., Pasek, D. A., and Meissner, G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar). We found that two fusion proteins including amino acids 3225–3662 of RyR1 (FPI) and amino acids 4302–4430 (FPM) specifically bound [35S]CaM in a Ca2+-dependent and independent manner, respectively (Fig. 1) (10Balshaw, D. M., Xu, L., Yamaguchi, N., Pasek, D. A., and Meissner, G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar). In this study, we further subdivided the larger of the two fusion proteins (FPI) into four fragments (FPI-(1–4)) using specific restriction enzyme sites. The fragments were expressed as trpE fusion proteins. FPI-1 (3225–3353) was also expressed as a GST fusion protein because the expression level of the trpE fusion protein was very low. Since all fusion proteins were insoluble, [35S]CaM overlays were done with whole cell fractions in Fig. 1. The amounts of proteins on the gels were adjusted to show similar Coomassie Blue staining for the fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 B shows that in the presence of 100 nm [35S]CaM and 100 μm Ca2+, three of the fusion proteins clearly showed detectable [35S]CaM binding. The strongest binding was observed for FPI-4 followed by FPI and FPM. We also performed [35S]CaM overlays in the presence of 5 mmEGTA instead of 100 μm Ca2+. As previously found (10Balshaw, D. M., Xu, L., Yamaguchi, N., Pasek, D. A., and Meissner, G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar), FPM bound [35S]apoCaM at a level comparable with CaCaM. FPI did not show apoCaM binding and, as expected, neither did the FPI-derived fragments. These results show that [35S]CaM could bind to two fusion proteins derived from RyR1; binding to one fusion protein was Ca2+-dependent, whereas binding to the other was Ca2+-independent. Primary sequence predictions suggest the presence of several CaM binding sites in RyR1 (23Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 24Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these sites was predicted to be present in FPI-4 (3614–3637). Using nnPredict (University of California, San Francisco, CA), we identified a stretch of amino acids (aa 3617–3628) predicted to form an amphipathic α-helical structure but not in perfect agreement with reported CaM binding motifs. Therefore, we somewhat arbitrarily mutated three hydrophobic amino acid residues (Val 3619 to Ala, Trp 3620 to Ala, and Leu 3624 to Ala and Asp) lying on one face of the helix. We also substituted cysteine 3635 with an alanine because CaM blockage ofN-ethylmaleimide alkylation of Cys 3635 suggested that this residue may be important for CaM binding (25Moore C.P. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All of the mutant fusion proteins including wt were isolated as inclusion bodies and tested for [35S]CaCaM binding using the overlay assay. Equivalent amounts of wt and mutated FPI-4s were used based on Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gels. The results of the overlay assay are shown in Fig. 2. The strongest binding was observed for wt and C3635A mutant proteins. Mutant proteins with V3619A or L3624A substitutions showed reduced binding, whereas mutant proteins with W3620A or L3624D substitutions barely showed detectable binding. The results identify two amino acid residues (Trp 3620, Leu 3624) that are critical for CaCaM binding to FPI-4. However, it was unclear whether the results with the fusion protein were directly applicable to the full-length RyR1. The information gained was limited because FPI-4 did not bind apoCaM and, therefore, could not be used to locate the apoCaM binding sites in RyR1. Also, [35S]CaM overlays revealed two candidate CaCaM binding sites as opposed to one site/subunit in the native RyR1. Therefore, we extended our mutant studies to the intact RyR1. We introduced three site-specific mutations in the full-length RyR1 that led to nearly a complete loss (W3620A,L3624D) or a reduction (V3619A) of [35S]CaM binding to FPI-4 (Fig.2). We also generated a deletion mutant (RyR1Δ4274–4535) to address the significance of a Ca2+-independent CaM binding site detected in the overlays in FPM (aa 4302–4430) (Fig. 1, Band C). The mutant RyR1s were expressed in HEK293 cells, and crude membrane fractions were prepared to determine their CaM binding properties. In parallel experiments, the RyR1 expression levels were quantified by a ligand binding assay using saturating [3H]ryanodine concentrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of full-length wt and mutant RyR1s was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-RyR1 monoclonal antibody D110 (26Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In Fig.3, we used 5 and 15 nm[35S]CaM, which are near and beyond the dissociation constants of apoCaM and CaCaM binding to the native and purified RyR1 under the assay conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” (10Balshaw, D. M., Xu, L., Yamaguchi, N., Pasek, D. A., and Meissner, G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar). Cells expressing wt-RyR1 bound 3–4 [35S]apoCaM and 4–5 [35S]CaCaM/[3H]ryanodine binding site. As there is only one high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding site/RyR1 tetramer, these ratios corresponded to ∼1 apoCaM and 1 CaCaM binding site/RyR1 subunit. RyR1 mutant with a V3619A substitution and RyR1Δ4274–4535 bound [35S]apoCaM and [35S]CaCaM not significantly different from wt-RyR1. W3620A bound only [35S]apoCaM, whereas L3624D showed a loss of high affinity [35S]CaM binding both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. These studies provided information beyond that obtained with the fusion proteins. The results of Fig. 3 indicate that in the intact RyR1 amino acid residues 4274–4535 are not important for high affinity apoCaM and CaCaM binding. Rather, they suggest that Leu 3624 constitutes a part of both the apoCaM and the CaCaM binding site in the intact RyR1, whereas Trp 3620 appeared to be only a part of the CaCaM binding site, results that could not be obtained with the mutant fusion proteins because FPI-4 did not show apoCaM binding. We next examined the functional effects of CaCaM on the four RyR1 mutants shown in Fig. 3 by determining their [3H]ryanodine binding properties in the absence and presence of exogenously added CaM. The highly specific plant alkaloid ryanodine is widely used as a probe of channel activity because of its preferential binding to the open RyR channel states (1Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The four mutants exhibited a specific [3H]ryanodine binding affinity (determined by Scatchard analysis) and Ca2+activation/inactivation profile comparable with wt-RyR1 with the exception of RyR1Δ4274–4535, which showed an ∼10-fold increased sensitivity to activating Ca2+ in agreement with a previous report (22Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11778-11783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Fig.4 A shows that [3H]ryanodine binding to wt-RyR1 was inhibited by CaCaM in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 ∼50 nm. The maximal extent of inhibition (60% by ∼1 μm CaM) was comparable with that observed for native RyR1s (6Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant (RyR1Δ4274–4535) showed a response to CaCaM essentially identical to wt-RyR1. V3619A required a higher CaCaM concentration for the inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding (IC50 ∼200 nm as compared with IC50 ∼50 nmfor wt-RyR1). L3624D exhibited a greatly reduced apparent affinity for CaCaM as indicated by the requirement of 3 μm CaCaM for partial inhibition of RyR1 activity, whereas W3620A did not show any inhibition at 3 μm CaCaM. Fig. 4 B shows that, in agreement with the apoCaM binding data of Fig. 3 B, 1 μm apoCaM significantly increased [3H]ryanodine binding to wt and V3619A, W3620A, and Δ4274–4535 RyR1s but not L3624D. Taken together, the results of the [35S]CaM (Fig. 3) and [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 4) experiments suggest that Leu 3624 constitutes a part of the CaCaM inhibiting and apoCaM activating sites of RyR1, whereas Trp 3620 appears to be only essential for CaCaM inhibition. Dissociation and chase experiments were performed to determine whether CaCaM and apoCaM share a common binding domain in native RyR1s using a filtration assay. As shown in Fig.5 A, the dissociation of [35S]CaM from skeletal muscle SR vesicles enriched in RyR1 is not largely dependent of whether CaM is bound in the presence or absence of Ca2+ but rather on whether Ca2+is present in the dissociation buffer with apoCaM dissociating at a significantly greater rate than CaCaM. In a similar set of experiments, SR vesicles were preincubated with or without non-radioactive CaM in either the presence or absence of Ca2+ followed by the binding of radioactive CaCaM. The resulting rates of [35S]CaM binding were dramatically slower to vesicles pretreated with non-radioactive CaM (Fig.5 B, open symbols) than the rates of binding to vesicles not pretreated with CaM (Fig. 5 B, closed symbols). Furthermore, the rates were relatively independent of whether the preincubation had been performed in the absence or presence of Ca2+. These experiments strongly support the mutant results that CaCaM and apoCaM bind to a common region of RyR1. Calmodulin has a dual effect on skeletal muscle Ca2+release channel activity. CaM activates the channel at Ca2+concentrations below 1 μm, whereas at Ca2+concentrations above 1 μm, the channel activity is inhibited by CaM. The data we have presented here indicate that these effects are mediated through a single CaM binding domain that is shared by apoCaM and CaCaM. Several studies have reported the stoichiometry of CaM binding to RyR1 using SR vesicles (6Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) labeled CaM revealed that the native RyR1 binds with nanomolar affinity 1 CaM/subunit in the presence of Ca2+, and that there are as many as six high affinity binding sites for apoCaM on each of the four RyR1 subunits that comprise the functional channel. More recent studies using35S metabolically labeled CaM indicate that the tetrameric skeletal muscle channel complex binds 4 CaM molecules both in the absence and presence of Ca2+ or 1 CaM/subunit (8Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M. Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C724-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Balshaw, D. M., Xu, L., Yamaguchi, N., Pasek, D. A., and Meissner, G. (2001) J.

These results imply that chemical modification of CaM increases the number of CaM binding sites of RyR1. Previous studies performed to localize the CaM binding sites relied on the use of fusion proteins and synthetic peptides (Fig.6). CaM overlays of RyR1 fusion proteins using 125I (15Chen S.R.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22698-22704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or digoxigenin-labeled (16Menegazzi P. Larini F. Treves S. Guerrini R. Quadroni M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9078-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) CaM revealed up to seven regions that bound CaM. With the exception of one site, CaM binding was abolished in the presence of EGTA, indicating that it was Ca2+-dependent. Our protein overlays using [35S]CaM identified potential binding domains in two fusion proteins; one of which, FPM (aa 4302–4430), bound CaM both in the absence and presence of Ca2+. The other fusion protein, FPI-4 (aa 3553–3662), bound CaM only in the presence of Ca2+ in agreement with previous studies using fusion proteins (15Chen S.R.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22698-22704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Menegazzi P. Larini F. Treves S. Guerrini R. Quadroni M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9078-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studies with fusion proteins show that the fragmentation of the 565 kDa of RyR peptide into smaller pieces unmasks CaM binding sites not detected in the large channel complex. It is therefore necessary that full-length RyR1 mutants lacking putative CaM binding sites are constructed and that the functional consequences of these mutations are examined. Deletion of one of the potential CaM binding sites identified in the [35S]CaM overlays, RyR1Δ4274–4535, was without effect on high affinity CaM binding and the inhibition and activation of [3H]ryanodine binding by CaCaM and apoCaM, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4). In this study, we therefore focused on amino acid residues covered by FPI-4 (aa 3553–3662), which contained a CaM binding site implicated in all previous studies (Fig. 6). Three amino acid substitutions (V3619A,W3620A,L3624D) in FPI-4, leading to a reduction or nearly a complete loss of [35S]CaCaM binding, were introduced in the full-length RyR1. One of the mutants (L3624D) showed a loss of both high affinity apoCaM and CaCaM binding, whereas a second mutant (W3620A) showed a specific loss of CaCaM binding as it maintained the ability to bind [35S]CaM (nanomolar) in the absence of Ca2+. These results suggest that Leu 3624 is critical for conferring both apoCaM and CaCaM binding, whereas Trp 3620 is critical only for CaCaM. The physiological relevance of these findings was supported by [35S]CaM dissociation and chase experiments, which indicated that the native RyR1 has a site that interacts with both apoCaM and CaCaM. Using cryoelectron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction, Samsoet al. (27Samso M. Berkowitz J. Wagenknecht T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 149Google Scholar) showed that apoCaM and CaCaM bind to two near but distinct cytoplasmic locations on each of the four subunits of the RyR1. This observation suggests that apoCaM and/or CaCaM binding induce major RyR1 protein conformational changes given that it is unlikely that a shift of CaM by several amino acids can be detected at the resolution achievable by electron microscopy. Our data are in good agreement with a recent report by Moore et al. (13Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) who suggested that the region of the RyR1 identified in this study binds both apoCaM and CaCaM as both CaM forms were capable of protecting RyR1 from trypsin cleavage at arginines 3630 and 3637. Furthermore, these investigators showed that a synthetic peptide (aa 3614–3643), which included the two trypsin cleavage sites, bound both apoCaM and CaCaM (18Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A shorter peptide (aa 3614–3635) bound CaCaM but showed a loss of apoCaM binding, whereas another peptide including neither Trp 3620 nor Leu 3624 (aa 3625–3644) bound apoCaM and with a reduced affinity CaCaM (18Rodney G.G.

Therefore, the results obtained with synthetic peptides (18Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the intact RyR1 in this study do not agree entirely. The functional consequences of our mutations were assessed by determining their Ca2+ dependence and [3H]ryanodine binding properties. The RyR1 mutants bound [3H]ryanodine with an affinity and showed a Ca2+ dependence comparable with wt-RyR1 with the exception of RyR1Δ4274–4535, which showed an ∼10-fold increased sensitivity to activating Ca2+, as previously reported (22Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11778-11783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutations did not introduce major global conformational changes, but rather they appeared to be mostly limited to the CaM binding sites. The functional studies also allowed tests of the effects of micromolar concentrations of CaM as opposed to the binding studies that are limited to nanomolar CaM concentrations due to experimental restraints. [3H]Ryanodine binding to W3620A was not inhibited by 3 μm CaCaM, which suggests a complete loss or at least a very large reduction of CaCaM binding affinity. L3624D and V3619A were inhibited by CaM with IC50 ∼3 μm and ∼200 nm, respectively, as compared with IC50 ∼50 nm for wt in agreement with the binding studies, which showed nearly a complete loss of CaCaM binding for L3624D but not for V3619A. In addition to regulating the Ca2+ release channel, CaM probably also influences Ca2+ release through other proteins that interact with the release channel. Potential targets of CaM regulation are the transverse tubule Ca2+ channel, which via a direct interaction controls the SR Ca2+release channel, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (calcineurin) (1Coronado R.

Our work provides information for future studies of distinguishing CaM regulation of the RyR1 from that of other proteins. We show that two single amino acid substitutions distinctly change the regulation of the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel by CaM; one of which (L3624D) results in a loss of activation by apoCaM and an inhibition by CaCaM, whereas the other (W3620A) specifically abolishes CaCaM inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2092455126,"The cyclic AMP-dependent kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) function as scaffolds for a wide-range of protein-protein interactions. The 250-kDa AKAP known as gravin plays a central role in organizing G-protein-coupled receptors to the protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate receptor function in desensitization, resensitization, and sequestration. Although gravin is critical for G-protein-linked receptor biology, the molecular features of the receptor necessary for interaction with this scaffold are not known. Herein, we map the regions of the β2-adrenergic receptor that are required for binding to gravin. Intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 appear not to participate in the binding of the receptor to the scaffold. In contrast, the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor (Arg-329 to Leu-413) competes readily for the binding of the β2-adrenergic receptor by gravin, both using in vitro and in vivo assays. C-terminally truncated peptides with sequences ranging from Arg-329 to Leu-342 (13 aminoacyl residues), to Asn-352 (23 residues), to Tyr-366 (37 residues), to Asp-380 (51 residues), or to His-390 (61 residues), as well as N-terminally truncated peptides from Gln-391 to Leu-413 (23 residues) or Leu-381 to Leu-413 (33 residues) displayed no ability to block binding of receptor to gravin. The combination of Arg-329 to His-390 peptide and Gln-391 to Leu-413 peptide, however, reconstitutes a fragmented but full-length C-terminal region and also potently blocks the ability of gravin to bind the β2-adrenergic receptor. The gravin-receptor interaction was examined in response to agonist by confocal microscopy. Remarkably, the association of the receptor with gravin was not disrupted during agonist-induced sequestration. The receptor-scaffold complex was maintained during agonist-induced sequestration. These data, in agreement with the biochemical data, reveal that gravin binds the receptor through the β2-adrenergic receptor C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and that this interaction is maintained as the receptor is internalized. This is the first report of an AKAP scaffold protein translocating with its receptor, in this case a G-protein-coupled receptor. The cyclic AMP-dependent kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) function as scaffolds for a wide-range of protein-protein interactions. The 250-kDa AKAP known as gravin plays a central role in organizing G-protein-coupled receptors to the protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate receptor function in desensitization, resensitization, and sequestration. Although gravin is critical for G-protein-linked receptor biology, the molecular features of the receptor necessary for interaction with this scaffold are not known. Herein, we map the regions of the β2-adrenergic receptor that are required for binding to gravin. Intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 appear not to participate in the binding of the receptor to the scaffold. In contrast, the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor (Arg-329 to Leu-413) competes readily for the binding of the β2-adrenergic receptor by gravin, both using in vitro and in vivo assays. C-terminally truncated peptides with sequences ranging from Arg-329 to Leu-342 (13 aminoacyl residues), to Asn-352 (23 residues), to Tyr-366 (37 residues), to Asp-380 (51 residues), or to His-390 (61 residues), as well as N-terminally truncated peptides from Gln-391 to Leu-413 (23 residues) or Leu-381 to Leu-413 (33 residues) displayed no ability to block binding of receptor to gravin. The combination of Arg-329 to His-390 peptide and Gln-391 to Leu-413 peptide, however, reconstitutes a fragmented but full-length C-terminal region and also potently blocks the ability of gravin to bind the β2-adrenergic receptor.

This is the first report of an AKAP scaffold protein translocating with its receptor, in this case a G-protein-coupled receptor.

Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 3Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor, for example, leads to activation of adenylylcyclase, increased accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP, and activation of protein kinase A. Although ubiquitously found in nature, this signaling cascade activates protein kinase A in unique manners that can only be explained by spatially distinct forms of the kinase. The discovery of protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (termed AKAPs) helped to solve the question of spatial specificity of protein kinase A responses (4Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). With at least 70 known sequences, the AKAP family appears to function in the targeting and localization of not just protein kinase A, but also other protein kinases and phosphatases (5Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Members of the AKAP79/150 family and gravin (AKAP250) are examples of AKAPs that can bind protein phosphatases, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A. Key to our understanding of gravin was the observation that it associates in a complex with the β2-adrenergic receptor, the prototypic GPCR coupled to adenylylcyclase, and to protein kinase A, which acts both downstream (activation) and upstream (phosphorylation) of the β2-adrenergic receptor (6Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Gravin has been shown to act as a scaffold protein, capable of organizing protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and protein phosphatase-2B with the β2-adrenergic receptor (6Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that the gravin-β2-adrenergic receptor complex includes not only these kinases and phosphatase, but also G-protein-linked receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and transiently with both β-arrestin and clathrin (7Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Ht31-peptide can compete for the binding of protein kinase A to AKAPs (8Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Disruption of gravin-protein kinase A interaction with the Ht31-peptide disrupts the β2-adrenergic receptor signaling complex, as does suppression of gravin expression with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (6Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Similarly, suppression of the expression of protein kinase A or protein kinase C, as compared with simple block of activity with chemical inhibitors, leads to disruption of the β2-adrenergic receptor signaling complex (9Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Shih M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21478-21483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gravin localization has been defined in living cells by the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged gravin and epifluorescence microscopy. Gravin is localized to the membrane and also is found distributed in the cytosol (7Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here we report on the results of studies designed to address two significant questions about the gravin-β2-adrenergic receptor complex: what is the structural basis of the β2-adrenergic receptor that is responsible for its interaction with the gravin scaffold protein, and whether the gravin-β2-adrenergic receptor complex is retained following agonist treatment. The results from these studies reveal the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the β2-adrenergic receptor as the site of receptor-gravin interaction and that the β2-adrenergic receptor remains associated with gravin following agonist activation and agonist-induced sequestration. These are the first data to reveal an AKAP as a “mobile” scaffold that appears to retain the receptor-gravin complex during sequestration and internalization (further treated under “Discussion”). To construct GST fusion proteins, DNA sequences corresponding to the indicated regions of human β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 1) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from pcDNA3-β2-adrenergic receptor-GFP. Primers (sequences of all primers used available from the authors upon request) were designed to generate PCR products with 5′ BamHI and 3′EcoRI restriction sites. PCR products were gel-purified, double-digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the GST fusion protein vector pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing, transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21, and screened for isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside-induced expression of fusion proteins. Selected clones were used to inoculate 1000-ml aliquots of LB medium, and the inoculated mixture was incubated at 30 °C overnight with vigorous shaking. Expression of fusion protein was induced at 30 °C for another 4 h in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The collected pellets were resuspended in 36 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 ml of protease inhibitor mixture Set III (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and distributed into 5-ml aliquots, and each was then sonicated for 1 min. Fusion proteins were extracted by adding 4 ml of 10% Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1%) and mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh container. A 0.8-ml of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to the supernatant, and the slurry was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min and washed four times with 30 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B were released by treatment with 100 mm reduced glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline. Human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. For most studies, A431 cells were either untreated or stimulated with 10 μmisoproterenol for 30 min. Cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet-40, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation of the cell debris at 10,000 ×g for 15 min, the lysate were precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 90 min and then incubated with or without GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture were then subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with antibodies specific to the β-adrenergic receptor (CM4) or gravin. The primary antibodies were linked covalently to a protein A/G-agarose matrix. Immune complexes were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and separated on 4–12% linear gradient SDS-acrylamide Laemmli gels. Immunoblotting and detection of gravin and of the β2-adrenergic receptor by immunostaining was performed as previously described (4Dodge K. Scott J.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In several experiments, wild-type and mutated versions of a β2-adrenergic receptor that was tagged with the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) was expressed in A431 cells. Anti-HA antibodies were employed to immunoprecipitate the HA-tagged receptors from whole-cell extracts prepared from transiently transfected clones, as described above. To create a Flag epitope-tagged, β2-adrenergic receptor-enhanced blue fluorescent protein (eBFP) fusion protein, primers were designed to amplify the eBFP fragment from the eBFP-N1 plasmid vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with an XbaI site at the N terminus, CGGGTCTAGAATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG, and aNotI site at the C terminus, CGGGGCGGCCGCTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCC. TheXbaI/NotI-digested PCR product was combined with the Flag-tagged, β2-adrenergic receptor fragment that was excised from β2-adrenergic receptor-GFP construct (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic, Department of Pharmacology, Thomas Jefferson Medical School) by digesting the vector withHindIII/XbaI and subcloning this fragment intoHindIII/NotI-digested pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A431 cells were transfected with gravin-GFP using Lipofectin® (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and viable clones were selected in 400 μg/ml of the neomycin analogue G418. Resistant colonies were subcloned and screened for GFP fusion protein expression by epifluorescence microscopy. Selected stable transfected cell lines were then transfected with β2-adrenergic receptor-eBFP-pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+), selected in 100 μg/ml Zeocin, and screened for eBFP fusion protein expression by epifluorescence microscopy. Microscopy of live cells was performed on the Eclipse TE300 (Nikon) inverted microscope equipped with 40× objective and set of filters. Images were acquired using MicroMAX imaging system (Princeton Instruments Inc.) and WinView32 software. Fluorescent dyes were imaged sequentially in frame-interface mode to eliminate spectral overlapping between the channels. A431 cells stable expressing β2-adrenergic receptor growing on glass slides were either left untreated or stimulated with 10 μmisoproterenol for 30 min and then washed twice with HBBS, fixed (2% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.2), and permeabilized. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-gravin antibodies were used in combination with Alexa 633 anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes). Stained objects were imbedded in ProLong (Molecular Probes) anti-fade reagent. Images were acquired on the Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope using argon and helium-neon lasers (oil-immersion, 60× objective). Fluorescent dyes were imaged simultaneously in frame-interface. Serial sections were acquired as a file, and maximum projection images were created in which single images are assembled from the brightest pixels in a stack (Z-series). Z-stacks of images were exported as TIFF files, and individual sections were analyzed for fluorescent signal overlap in Adobe Photoshop 5.5. The number of β2-adrenergic receptors was determined by radioligand binding. Approximately 106 stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were incubated with increasing concentrations (0–500 pm) of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 30 pm [125I]iodocyanopindolol in the absence (control) or presence of either 0–10− 4 m isoproterenol (for agonist competition assay) or 10 μm propranolol (for defining the amount of nonspecific binding) at 23 °C for 90 min. The incubation buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl (1Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The cells were collected on Whatman GF/C glass fiber membranes at reduced pressure and washed rapidly. The radioligand bound to the washed cell mass retained by the filter was quantified by use of a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was less than 5% of radioligand binding. Each experimental point was performed in triplicate. One day prior to the analysis, CHO cells stably transfected with β2-adrenergic receptor and β2-adrenergic receptor-eBFP-pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well. Cells were washed and challenged with 0–10− 4 m isoproterenol in 50 μl of HEM buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmNaHCO3, containing Ro-20–1724 (0.1 mm, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)) and adenosine deaminase (0.5 unit/ml) for 5 min. Reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of ice-cold ethanol, and the agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP production was determined, as described elsewhere (9Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In view of the central role of gravin in the biology of GPCRs, we sought to define the site(s) of the β2-adrenergic receptor through which it interacts with the gravin scaffold protein. The strategy was to express each of the cytoplasmic domains of the β2-adrenergic receptor and employ these as probes for disrupting the interaction between gravin and the receptor. The intracellular loops (iLs) 1, 2, and 3, as well as the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (termed the BAC1 domain) of the β2-adrenergic receptor, were selected as the major starting points. These domains have been established by immunochemical means as cytoplasmic (11Wang H. Lipfert L. Malbon C.C. Bahouth S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14424-14431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing a logical place to initiate the interactions with gravin (Fig. 1). The three intracellular loops (Ile-58 to Ile-72, Asp-130 to Arg-151, and Ser-220 to Leu-275) and C-terminal BAC1 (Arg-329 to Leu-413) were designed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase, and these GST fusion proteins each expressed in E. coli. The amount of fusion protein expressed was about 5 mg from 1-liter cultures of E. coli. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity, as deduced by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in SDS (Fig.2). The calculatedMr values (in thousands) for the GST fusion proteins of each of the intracellular loops and C-terminal tail were as follows: loop 1, 30.1; loop 2, 31.4; loop 3, 35.2; C-terminal tail, 38.2. By dynamic light scattering, the peptides appeared to be a mono-dispersion, and no secondary structure of note was detected either by circular dichroism studies or solution nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (not shown). The ability of the GST fusion proteins to compete with the β2-adrenergic receptor for gravin binding was tested in whole-cell extracts prepared from human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. The whole-cell extracts were supplemented with GST fusion protein to a final concentration of 100 nm, and the ability of immunoprecipitates of the β2-adrenergic receptor to co-precipitate gravin was measured by SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitates of the receptor that were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for gravin (Fig.3 A). The antibody against the β2-adrenergic receptor used in this study for immune precipitation pull-down reactions was CM-04, a polyclonal antibody directed against the first exofacial loop epitope of the β2-adrenergic receptor (11Wang H. Lipfert L. Malbon C.C. Bahouth S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14424-14431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of competing peptide, a strong signal representing gravin bound by the β2-adrenergic receptor was observed. This interaction of β2-adrenergic receptor and gravin has been detected by several independent means earlier (6Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 7Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At 100 nmconcentrations, only one of the GST fusion proteins, GST-BAC1, harboring the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, demonstrated the ability to block the interaction of the β2-adrenergic receptor with gravin. Fusion proteins with intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 all failed to block the receptor-gravin interaction. Even at concentrations up to 1 μm, or in combination with each other, these loop fusion proteins failed to alter the receptor-gravin interaction (not shown). The ability of the GST-BAC1 fusion protein to block the interaction of β2-adrenergic receptor with gravin was explored further in competition experiments in which the amount of GST-BAC1 protein included in the whole-cell lysate was varied from nil to 1 μm (Fig. 3 B). Increasing the concentration of BAC1 fusion protein from 1 to 1000 nm in the whole-cell extract produced a dose-dependent competition curve for the inhibition of gravin-β2-adrenergic receptor interaction. Based upon multiple competition curves, the concentration of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail-GST fusion protein at which 50% of the receptor-gravin binding was lost is ∼5 nm GST-BAC1, under these conditions. Concentrations at 100 nm or higher of GST-BAC1 fusion protein nearly abolished the ability of the β2-adrenergic receptor to interact with gravin. These data suggest that the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor is the dominant domain for interaction with the gravin scaffold protein. The intracellular loops, in contrast, do not appear to play a significant role in the gravin-receptor interaction, based upon their inability to block this interaction as GST fusion proteins. To test further the results obtained with the immunoprecipitations of the β2-adrenergic receptor, complementary experiments were performed in which the receptor-gravin complexes were isolated via immunoprecipitations with antibodies to gravin (Fig.4). The immune complexes of gravin were precipitated with anti-gravin antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies specific for β2-adrenergic receptor. The gravin-receptor interaction was observed in the absence of any competing peptide (Fig.4 A), confirming parallel experiments performed with immunoprecipitates obtained with the anti-β2-adrenergic receptor antibodies (Fig.3 A). In the presence of 100 nm concentrations of competing GST fusion proteins for intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3, the β2-adrenergic receptor-gravin interaction was not influenced. The competition experiments performed with 100 nm C-terminal fusion protein GST-BAC1, in sharp contrast, markedly attenuated the receptor-gravin interaction, as observed in Fig. 3 A. Thus, irrespective of the manner in which the receptor-gravin complexes are pulled down for analysis, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is the only β2-adrenergic receptor domain tested that blocks the ability of the β2-adrenergic receptor to bind to gravin. A dose-response experiment was performed for the receptor-gravin interaction with increasing amounts of competing GST-BAC1 fusion protein (Fig. 4 B). Increasing the concentration of GST-BAC1 from 1 to 1000 nm resulted in a dose-dependent loss of receptor-gravin interaction. The concentration of GST-BAC1 that yields 50% inhibition of β2-adrenergic receptor-gravin binding was less than 5 nm GST-BAC1, whereas concentrations of intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 to 1 μm were without effect (not shown). Based upon the data demonstrating the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the β2-adrenergic receptor to be the site of interaction with gravin, we prepared GST fusion proteins in which defined fragments of the C-terminal region were engineered (Fig. 1). Five fragments (designated C2–C6), varying in length from 61 to 13 aminoacyl residues and representing truncations from the C-terminal end of the region, were designed. Two additional peptides, 14 and 31 aminoacyl residues in length (designated CT1 and CT2, respectively), were prepared synthetically, each retaining the C-terminal sequence and truncated from the N-terminal region of BAC-1. As before, the BAC1 and C2–C6 series of GST fusion proteins containing these regions of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the β2-adrenergic receptor were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE and protein staining (Fig.5). The calculatedMr values (in thousands) for the GST fusion proteins of the cytoplasmic C terminus and each of the C-terminal truncation fragments were as follows: BAC1, 38.4; C2, 36.2, C3, 35.1; C4, 32.6; C5, 31.2; and C6, 30.9. The synthetic peptides corresponding to CT1 and CT2 were purified to homogeneity via HPLC. The GST fusion proteins and synthetic peptides displayed dynamic light scattering values, suggesting that each behaved as a mono-dispersion in solution. GST fusion proteins harboring other β2-adrenergic receptor sequences were found to display significant proteolytic processing that precluded their use (not shown). The C-terminally truncated GST fusion proteins of the β2-adrenergic receptor tail were used as probes to test whether they would disrupt the interaction of receptor with gravin. When added at 100 nm to the whole-cell extracts of A431 cells, none of the C-terminally truncated fusion proteins displayed the ability to influence the binding of β2-adrenergic receptor to gravin (Fig. 6 A). The BAC1 fusion protein at the same concentration essentially abolished the gravin-receptor interaction. Increasing the concentration of GST-C2, -C3, -C4, -C5, or -C6 to 1 μm failed to alter the gravin-receptor interaction (data not shown), as determined in immunoprecipitation pull-down reactions performed with antibodies to the β2-adrenergic receptor, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates with anti-gravin antibody. When the pull-downs were performed with antibodies to gravin and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to the β2-adrenergic receptor, essentially identical results were obtained (Fig. 6 B). The BAC1 fusion protein, but none of the C-terminally truncated versions of BAC1, was able to block effectively the gravin-β2-adrenergic receptor interaction. Thus, the data demonstrated that minimally, the C-terminal region of the β2-adrenergic receptor cytoplasmic tail is required for interaction with gravin. We explored whether fragments of the furthest C-terminal reach of the β2-adrenergic receptor cytoplasmic tail were sufficient to block the interaction of gravin with the receptor. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the region Gln-391–Leu-413-COOH (CT1) and region Leu-381–Leu-413-COOH (CT2) were purified and employed in these experiments (Fig. 1). At a final concentration of 100 nm in whole-cell extracts, neither CT1 nor CT2 peptides alone influenced the ability of β2-adrenergic receptors to bind to gravin in pull-down assays with antibodies to the receptor and immunoblotting of the immune complexes stained with anti-gravin antibodies (Fig.7 A). The GST fusion protein with the full-length, cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the β2-adrenergic receptor (GST-BAC1) sharply reduced the receptor-gravin interaction. Next, we tested the ability of the CT1 fragment to act in tandem with GST fusion proteins containing the C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 regions of the β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 1) to inhibit gravin-receptor binding. The N-terminal fragment GST-C2 and the CT1 C-terminal fragment, when used in combination, reconstituted the inhibition of the gravin-β2-adrenergic receptor interaction (Fig. 7 A). Similar reconstitutions of CT1 with GST-C3, -C4, -C5, and -C6, in contrast, failed to yield any significant ability to compete for the binding of the receptor to the gravin scaffold protein. Complementary experiments were conducted in which the pull-downs were performed with anti-gravin antibodies and the immunoblots of the immune complexes were stained with antibodies to the β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 7 B). The results obtained when the receptor-gravin complexes are pulled down with antibodies to gravin were identical to those when the pull-downs were performed with antibodies to the receptor. These data suggest that the determinants for the binding of the β2-adrenergic receptor to gravin are polytopic and require both N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. The results obtained from in vitro experiments in which peptides compete for binding sites on gravin provided compelling data that the cytoplasmic C terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor is the major site of protein-protein interactions with the gravin scaffold protein. To test the conclusions in vivo, we engineered a mammalian expression vector into which the BAC1 was inserted and examined the ability of the BAC1 to compete for gravin binding with the β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig.8).

https://openalex.org/W2166053898,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) encodes two isoforms of delta antigens (HDAgs). The small form of HDAg is required for HDV RNA replication, while the large form of HDAg inhibits the viral replication and is required for virion assembly. In this study, we found that the expression of B23, a nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in disparate functions including nuclear transport, cellular proliferation, and ribosome biogenesis, is up-regulated by these two HDAgs. Using in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, we have demonstrated that both isoforms of HDAg can interact with B23 and their interaction domains were identified as the NH2-terminal fragment of each molecule encompassing the nuclear localization signal but not the coiled-coil region of HDAg. Sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis indicated that the majority of small HDAg, but a lesser amount of the large HDAg, co-sedimented with B23 and nucleolin in the large nuclear complex. Transient transfection experiments also indicated that introducing exogenous full-length B23, but not a mutated B23 defective in HDAg binding, enhanced HDV RNA replication. All together, our results reveal that HDAg has two distinct effects on nucleolar B23, up-regulation of its gene expression and the complex formation, which in turn regulates HDV RNA replication. Therefore, this work demonstrates the important role of nucleolar protein in regulating the HDV RNA replication through the complex formation with the key positive regulator being small HDAg. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) encodes two isoforms of delta antigens (HDAgs). The small form of HDAg is required for HDV RNA replication, while the large form of HDAg inhibits the viral replication and is required for virion assembly. In this study, we found that the expression of B23, a nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in disparate functions including nuclear transport, cellular proliferation, and ribosome biogenesis, is up-regulated by these two HDAgs. Using in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, we have demonstrated that both isoforms of HDAg can interact with B23 and their interaction domains were identified as the NH2-terminal fragment of each molecule encompassing the nuclear localization signal but not the coiled-coil region of HDAg. Sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis indicated that the majority of small HDAg, but a lesser amount of the large HDAg, co-sedimented with B23 and nucleolin in the large nuclear complex. Transient transfection experiments also indicated that introducing exogenous full-length B23, but not a mutated B23 defective in HDAg binding, enhanced HDV RNA replication. All together, our results reveal that HDAg has two distinct effects on nucleolar B23, up-regulation of its gene expression and the complex formation, which in turn regulates HDV RNA replication. Therefore, this work demonstrates the important role of nucleolar protein in regulating the HDV RNA replication through the complex formation with the key positive regulator being small HDAg. hepatitis delta virus glutathione S-transferase hepatitis delta antigen hepatitis B virus immunoprecipitation nuclear localization signal nucleolin-binding site kilobase(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis metallothionein human immunodeficiency virus Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a negative-strand RNA virus and is also a subviral satellite of hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 (1Rizzetto M. Hepatology. 1983; 3: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Patients co-infected with HDV and HBV are at high risk for developing fulminant hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Hoffnagle J.H. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1989; 261: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This virus has a single-stranded circular RNA genome of 1.7 kb which is folded into an unbranched rod-like structure (for review, see Ref. 3Lai M.M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholarand the references therein). Apart from its RNA genome, the HDV particle also contains hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), the only known protein encoded by HDV, and an envelope provided by the surface antigen (HBsAg) of HBV. However, HDV RNA replication is independent of its HBV helper and is dependent on the presence of HDAg (4Kuo M.Y.P. Chao M. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HDAg exists as two protein species of 27 (214 amino acid residues) and 24 (195 amino acid residues) kDa, known as large and small HDAg, respectively (5Weiner A.J. Choo Q.L. Wang K.S. Govindarajan S. Redeker A.G. Gerin J.L. Houghton M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 594-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two isoforms are translated from the same initiation codon of a single open reading frame, but the large HDAg contains an additional 19 amino acids at its carboxyl terminus, which is the result of RNA editing of the termination codon of small HDAg during the viral replication (6Luo G. Chao M. Hsieh S.Y. Sureau C. Nishikura K. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional domains of HDAg have been well characterized (for review, see Refs. 3Lai M.M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and 7Lazinski D. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). These include an NH2-terminal coiled-coil domain (amino acid residues 31–52) for HDAg oligomerization (7Lazinski D. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang J.G.

Lin J.-H. Chao M. McKnight K. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2221-2227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the COOH-terminal portion of large HDAg contains a prenylation site, which is important for viral particle assembly with HBsAg (17Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although containing similar sequences and functional domains, these two isoforms of HDAgs have different roles during HDV life cycle. Small HDAg functions to facilitate HDV RNA replication in a manner that is not yet understood (4Kuo M.Y.P. Chao M. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while large HDAg acts as a potent trans-dominant inhibitor for HDV replication (19Chao M. Hsieh S.Y. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5066-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Glenn J.S. White J.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2357-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and interacts with HBsAg during HDV viral particle assembly (18Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J.

Both HDAgs are phosphoprotein (23Chang M.-F. Baker S.C. Soe L.H. Ksmahora T. Keck J.G. Makino S. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2403-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hwang S.B.

More recent studies suggested that HDAg has a RNA chaperone activity (28Huang Z.-S. Wu H.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and can interact with nucleolin for targeting to nucleolus (29Lee C.-H. Chand S.C. Chen C.-J. Chang M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7650-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The trans-suppression ability of both HDAgs on RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription (30Lo K. Sheu G.-T. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1998; 247: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the observed trans-activation ability of the large HDAg on certain promoters (31Wei Y. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), imply that HDAg has the ability to modulate host cellular gene expression. The exact molecular mechanism for HDV RNA replication is still obscure. A double rolling-circle mechanism for HDV replication has been proposed whereby the host-encoded polymerase undergoes RNA-dependent RNA synthesis to produce a circular unit-length complement of the genomic RNA, termed the antigenome (for review, see Ref. 3Lai M.M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and references therein). The antigenomic RNA, which is also the coding strand for HDAg, serves as a template for the synthesis of genomic RNA via the same rolling-circle mechanism. Since HDAg does not possess any RNA polymerase activity, the host-encoded RNA polymerase is required for HDV replication in a RNA-directed RNA synthesis manner. However, the identity of the responsible polymerase and the nature of the essential role of the small HDAg in the HDV replication remain unclear. Although host RNA polymerase II is suspected to be involved (32Macnaughton T.B. Gowans E.J. McNamara S.P. Burrell C.J. Virology. 1991; 184: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Fu T.-B. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Filipovska J. Konarska M.M. RNA. 2000; 6: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a more recent study by Modahl et al. (35Modahl L.E. Macnaughton T.B. Zhu N. Johnson D.L. Lai M.M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6030-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggested that this might be not the case. Notably, the finding that the HDAg-associated cellular factors, delta-interacting protein A and nucleolin, can modulate HDV RNA replication (29Lee C.-H. Chand S.C. Chen C.-J. Chang M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7650-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Brazas R. Ganem D. Science. 1996; 274: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggests that cellular factors other than RNA polymerase are involved in HDV replication. In this study, we found that the mRNA level of the human nucleolar protein B23 gene is up-regulated in both HDV-replicating and HDAg-producing cell lines. B23 is a major nucleolar phosphoprotein that performs a plethora of activities. This protein-like nucleolin is present in abundance in both tumor cells and proliferating cells and constitutes a common signal for cell proliferation (37Peter M. Nakagawa J. Moree M. Labbe J.-C. Doree M. Amalric F. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 38Feuerstein N. Spegieland S. Mond J.J. J.

It localizes in granular regions of nucleoli (40Spector D.L. Ochs R.L. Busch H. Chromosoma ( Berl .). 1984; 90: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 41Peculis B.A. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), is associated with preribosomal particles (42Prestayko A.W. Klomp G.R. Schmoll D.J. Busch H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1945-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Yung B.Y.M. Busch H. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 826: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and forms hexamers that may be important for the assembly of ribosomes (44Yung B.Y.M. Chan P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45Herrera J.E. Correia J.J. Jones A.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2668-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). B23 has the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (46Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), and binds to nuclear localization signal containing peptides (47Szebeni A. Herrera J.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and thus serves as a shuttle protein in the nuclear import. For example, it forms a specific complex with the nucleolar protein, p120 (48Valdez B.C. Perlaky L. Henning D. Saijo Y. Chan P.-K. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23776-23783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nucleolin (49Li Y.-P. Busch R.K. Valdez B.C. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and several viral proteins such as Rex of human T-cell leukemia virus (50Adachi Y. Copeland T.D. Hatanaka M. Oroszlan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13930-13934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Rev (51Fankhauser C. Izaurralde E. Adachi Y. Wingfield P. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2567-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Tat (52Li Y.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4098-4102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Its function is to facilitate their nuclear import. Interestingly, in this study we also found that the B23 protein can directly interact with the two isoforms of HDAg and the interaction domains of B23-HDAg reside within the fragment containing the nuclear localization signal of HDAg, suggesting that B23 may serve as shuttle protein for transport of HDAg into the nucleus. Additionally, our results also indicated that the small HDAg is found in a complex of B23 and nucleolin with a size larger than 700 kDa, and the interaction of small HDAg with B23 regulates HDV RNA replication. Therefore, the association of the major nucleolar protein B23 and nucleolin with the small HDAg may represent an important mechanism for HDV RNA replication. Plasmid pSVL-d2g contains a head-to-tail tandem dimer of the full-length HDV cDNA (as 1.7-kb XbaI fragment) inserted at the XbaI site of the vector plasmid pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (25Yeh T.-S. Lo S.J. Chen P.-J. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6190-6198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On transfection into mammalian cells, this plasmid can direct replication of the viral genome and expression of HDAg. Plasmids pGEM3L and pGEM3S contain aScaI-EcoRI fragment (1.1 kb) of HDV cDNA driven by the SP6 or the T7 phage promoter of pGEM-3Zf(−) (53Hu H.-M. Shih K.-N. Lo S.J. J. Virol. Methods. 1996; 60: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which can allow the production of strand-specific probes by in vitro transcription and large or small HDAg by in vitrotranslation. Plasmids pGEX-3X-L and pGEX-3X-S, kindly provided by S. J. Lo (Yang-Ming University, Taiwan), contains theSstII-EcoRI fragment of the large or small HDAg open reading frame in-frame inserted into the plasmid pGEX-3X, which can direct the expression of either a GST-fused large HDAg (GST-DAg) or small HDAg (GST-dAg). Plasmid pCR3-FLAG-B23 is an expression construct of B23 in mammalian cells with an additional FLAG-tag at the NH2 terminus. This construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a NH2-terminal primer 5′-ACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACAAGCTTATGGAAGATTCGATGGAC-3′ and COOH-terminal primer 5′-CGCCGCGGATCCTTAAAGAGACTTCCTCCACT-3′ with a B23 cDNA clone pET-T7 as the template (54Liu Q.-R. Chan P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The amplified polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pCR3-FLAG-B23-(1–127) is a mutant derivative of pCR3-FLAG-B23 that can direct the expression of the NH2-terminal amino acid residues 1–127 of B23 fused with the FLAG-tag. The construction of the plasmid pCR3-FLAG-B23-(1–127) was carried out in a similar manner to pCR3-FLAG-B23 except that a different COOH-terminal polymerase chain reaction primer 5′-CCTCCTCTAGATTAATCTTCTGACTCTGCATC-3′ was used. The COOH-terminal truncated variants of the in vitro translated B23 were produced by the TNT system (Promega) from the plasmid of pCR3-FLAG-B23 digested with the restriction enzymes EarI,BstNI, HhaI, or BglII, allowing generation of the NH2-terminal 127, 144, 190, and 285 amino acid residues of B23, respectively. Plasmids expressing the His-tagged HDAg polypeptides, which included the wild-type full-length small HDAg, dAg-(1–195), and its deletion mutants NdAg-(1–88), NMdAg-(1–143), MdAg-(89–143), and CdAg-(89–195) (28Huang Z.-S. Wu H.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were kindly supplied by H.-N. Wu (Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Plasmids pMT-DAg and pMT-dAg contain a 1.1-kb ScaI-EcoRI fragment of the large or small HDAg cDNA sequence under human metallothionein (MT) promoter control. Plasmid pSVL-d contains a 1.1-kbScaI-EcoRI fragment of the small HDAg cDNA sequence under SV40 late promoter control. Plasmid pdAg-Δ(17–56), a derivative of pGEM-3Zf(−), can direct the expression of in vitro translated small HDAg variant dAg-Δ(17–56) with an in-frame deletion of residues 17–56 when prepared by the TNT system (Promega). Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HuH-7 and HepG2 were cultured as described in Yeh et al. (25Yeh T.-S. Lo S.J. Chen P.-J. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6190-6198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SVLD3-N1 cells (designated as N1) were HepG2 stable clones integrated with trimeric HDV cDNA and constitutively expressing both isoforms of the HDAgs and both HDV genomic and antigenomic RNA (55Chen P.-J. Kuo M.-Y. Chen M.-L. Tu S.-J. Chiu M.-N. Wu H.-L. Hsu H.C. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). L7 and L10 are the stable cell lines constitutively expressing the large HDAg in HepG2 cells, while S2 and S7 are the stable HepG2 cell lines expressing the small HDAg. These cell lines were established by transfected HepG2 cells (2 × 106 cells) with plasmid DNA of pMT-DAg or pMT-dAg (5 μg) together with pSV2-neo (0.5 μg) by electroporation. After 4 weeks selection with 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Sigma), cell colonies were picked up, cultured for another 2 weeks, and analyzed for the expression of HDAg by Western blotting. Detection of HDAg was performed with human anti-HDAg antiserum as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human antiserum as the secondary antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (ECL, Pierce). G418-resistant, HDAg-negative cell colonies (C4 and C5) were also picked up, expanded in G418-supplemented medium, and were used as control cell lines. For the transient transfection experiment, plasmid DNAs were transfected into HuH-7 cells by EffecteneTMtransfection reagent (Qiagen). For preparation of total cell lysates and nuclear extracts, cells were harvested, lysed, and treated as described by You et al. (56You L.-R. Chen C.-M. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1672-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57You L.-R. Chen C.-M. Yeh T.-S. Tsai T.-Y. Mai R.-T. Lin C.-H. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2841-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNAs from each cell lines were extracted by using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the instructions of the supplier. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total cellular RNA samples was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% formaldehyde, 1% agarose RNA gel and then transferred into a nylon filter. The filter were pre-hybridized and then hybridized according to the standard method (58Thomas P.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). For detection of genomic or antigenomic HDV RNA, the strand-specific HDV RNA probe was prepared byin vitro transcription of pGEM3L using the SP6/T7 transcription kit (25Yeh T.-S. Lo S.J. Chen P.-J. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6190-6198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differential display of mRNA was performed according to the instructions of the supplier using the RNAimage kit (GeneHunter Co.). Immunofluorescence was performed by a method modified from the published procedures (57You L.-R. Chen C.-M. Yeh T.-S. Tsai T.-Y. Mai R.-T. Lin C.-H. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2841-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Shih C.-M. Lo S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of HDAg and FLAG-tagged B23 protein in transfected cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy or confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS-NT). For immunofluorescence staining, the cells were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) (−20 °C) and probed with human anti-HDAg antiserum or mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG or rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The GST-HDAg fusion proteins expressed from pGEX-3X-L and pGEX-3X-S vectors were purified as described elsewhere (60Chen C.-M. You L.-R. Hwang L.-H. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9417-9426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Shih C.-M. Chen C.-M. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1160-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The His-tagged HDAg fusion proteins expressed from various expression vectors (dAg-(1–195), NdAg-(1–88), NMdAg-(1–143), MdAg-(89–153), and CdAg-(89–195)) (28Huang Z.-S. Wu H.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were affinity purified using a His-bound resin column according to the instructions from the supplier. For binding with the endogenous B23, HeLa cell nuclear extracts (200 μg) were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads prebound with GST or GST-HDAg (4 μg) or His resins prebound with His-tagged HDAg variants (4 μg) at 4 °C overnight under gentle agitation. The beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40. Proteins bound on beads were eluted using the sample buffer and resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 12.5% polyacrylamide gel), and processed for Western blot analysis. Detection of B23 was performed with goat anti-B23 antiserum (Santa Crutz) as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antiserum as the secondary antibody using the ECL method. For binding with the in vitrotranslated B23, the B23 variants (5 μl) were prepared from the various restriction enzyme-digested pCR3-FLAG-B23 by the TNT system (Promega) and incubated with GST or GST-HDAg bound glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl) at 4 °C overnight and the resins were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Proteins bound on beads were eluted by the sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel), and detected by autoradiography. For thein vivo co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of HDAg and B23, the nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells (500 μg) and N1 cells (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose (20 μl packed volume) conjugated with human anti-HDAg antiserum (20 μl) or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Kodak) as a negative control. For the in vitroco-IP of HDAg and B23, the in vitro translated B23 or HDAgs (5 μl each) were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose (20 μl packed volume) conjugated with human anti-HDAg antiserum (20 μl). Alternatively, the in vitro translated FLAG-tagged B23 or HDAg variants (10 μl each) were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose (20 μl packed volume) conjugated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (7.5 μl). The immunoprecipitates obtained from both experiments were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (in vitro co-IP) or 0.3% Nonidet P-40 (in vivo co-IP) and processed for immunoblot analysis or autoradiography. The nuclear extracts of the HDAg producing cell lines (L10 or S7) and their parental HepG2 cells were prepared for sucrose gradient centrifugation. Nuclear extracts (0.6 ml) (500 μg) were loaded on 10.8 ml of 10–60% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Samples were subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) for 16 h at 4 °C. The gradients were aliquoted into 0.6-ml fractions from the top and analyzed for B23 and HDAg by immunoblot. The protein standards thyroglobulin (669 kDa) and catalase (232 kDa) were also run on sucrose gradients in parallel with samples. To search for the cellular target genes affected by HDV, we performed an mRNA differential display assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The total RNAs from both HDV-producing N1 cells and its parental HepG2 cells were isolated and the differentially expressed RNAs were analyzed by the RNAimage kit (GeneHunter Co.). The identity of differentially expressed cDNA clones was determined by DNA sequencing and through sequence alignment, we found that one of the candidate genes was the human nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 (also known as nucleophosmin, NO38, or numatrin) (62Feuerstein N. Mond J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11389-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Hugle-Dorr B. Franke W.W.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of the B23 transcript in the HDV-producing N1 cell line (Fig.1A). To find out whether this enhancement of B23 expression resulted from HDAg, we also examined B23 expression in large and small HDAg-producing stable cell lines (L7 and L10 cell lines for large HDAg, S2, and S7 cell lines for small HDAg), parental HepG2 cells, and control cell lines which failed to show HDAg expression (C4 and C5) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Interestingly, although the expression level of the large HDAg is not comparable with that of the small HDAg in their respective producing cells as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B), the enhancement of B23 mRNA expression occurred to a similar extent as that found in the N1 cell line (about 3–4-fold increase) (Fig.1A). As noted, there is about a 2-fold increase in the protein level of B23 in these HDV- or HDAg-producing cells with nuclear nucleolin as a loading control (Fig. 1B), further supporting the notion that B23 expression is up-regulated in both the HDV- and the HDAg-producing cell lines. However, the lack of apparent correlation of the expression level of two isoforms of HDAg and the extent of B23 expression is intriguing. Clearly, the observed up-regulation of B23 expression in these HDAg-positive cells is HDAg-specific but not due to clonal selection against G418, since both G418-resistant, HDAg-negative cell lines C4 and C5 did not have any effect (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 2–6). Presumably, this may reflect the differentialtrans-activation ability of two isoforms of HDAg, a property noted previously (31Wei Y. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated the nuclear or nucleolar localization of HDAg (12Xia Y.-P. Yeh C.T. Ou J.H. Lai M.M.C. J.

Consistent with previous findings, both HDAg and B23 were nucleolar proteins when expressed in HeLa cells by transiently transfected with the HDV replication plasmid pSVL-d2g or the plasmid FLAG-tagged B23 and detected by the indirect immunofluorescence staining using the anti-HDAg or the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A,panels a-f). Furthermore, when the expression plasmids of HDAg (pMT-DAg or pMT-dAg) and FLAG-tagged B23 were co-transfected into HeLa cells, confocal microscopy analysis using the indirect immunofluorescence staining indicated that both forms of HDAgs co-localized with the FLAG-B23 in nucleoli (Fig. 2B, panels j-o). Similar results were obtained in cells transiently co-transfec"

A substantial fraction of circulating GH is complexed with a high-affinity GH-binding protein (GHBP) that in many species can be generated by GHR proteolysis and shedding of the receptor's ligand-binding extracellular domain. We previously showed that this proteolysis 1) can be acutely promoted by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 2) requires a metalloprotease activity, 3) generates both shed GHBP and a membrane-associated GHR transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain remnant, and 4) results in down-regulation of GHR abundance and GH signaling. Using cell culture model systems, we now explore the effects of GH treatment on inducible GHR proteolysis and GHBP shedding. In human IM-9 lymphocytes, which endogenously express GHRs, and in Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing wild-type or cytoplasmic domain internal deletion mutant rabbit GHRs, brief exposure to GH inhibited PMA-induced GHR proteolysis (receptor loss and remnant accumulation) by 60–93%. PMA-induced shedding of GHBP from Chinese hamster ovary transfectants was also inhibited by 70% in the presence of GH. The capacity of GH to inhibit inducible GHR cleavage did not rely on JAK2-dependent GH signaling, as evidenced by its continued protection in JAK2-deficient γ2A rabbit GHR cells. The GH concentration dependence for inhibition of PMA-induced GHR proteolysis paralleled that for its promotion of receptor dimerization (as monitored by formation of GHR disulfide linkage). Unlike GH, the GH antagonist, G120K, which binds to but fails to properly dimerize GHRs, alone did not protect against PMA-induced GHR proteolysis; G120K did, however, antagonize the protective effect of GH. Our data suggest that GH inhibits PMA-induced GHR proteolysis and GHBP shedding by inducing GHR dimerization and that this effect does not appear to be related to GH site 1 binding, GHR internalization, or GHR signaling.

As a GHBP-generating mechanism, GHR proteolysis can also lead to down-regulation of receptor abundance and GH signaling, thus further contributing to regulation of GH bioavailability (13Alele J.

An additional important step in understanding the molecular mechanism(s), physiological role(s), and regulation of GHR proteolysis is to determine the impact, if any, of GH on this process. GH initiates intracellular signals by interacting with the cell surface transmembrane GHR to form a complex of 1:2 GH:GHR stoichiometry (28Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G.

GH-induced formation of a GHR dimer is believed to be essential for normal GH signaling; GH antagonists with mutations at GH site 2 that do not allow proper formation of receptor dimers cannot themselves promote signaling but rather antagonize signaling by wild-type GH (30Fuh G.

Furthermore, it may be that steady-state GHBP levels reflect tissue GHR levels (4Baumann G. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 141: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,36Baumann G.

Using human HepG2 cells stably transfected with the rabbit GHR, Harrison et al. (22Harrison S.M. Barnard R. Ho K.Y. Rajkovic I. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 651-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) noted a significant 30% decline in GHBP spontaneously released over a 24-h interval when the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml human or bovine GH.

These authors suggested that the ability of GH to cause GHR internalization and degradation may account for its ability to prevent GHBP shedding induced in that study by N-ethylmaleimide treatment. In this study, we examine in model tissue culture systems the acute effects of GH on PMA-induced GHR proteolysis and GHBP shedding.

For the purposes of the experiments in this study, the three anti-GHR cytoplasmic domain antibodies each behaved similarly for immunoblotting of GHRs and remnants. Serum starvation of COS-7 transfectants, IM-9, CHO transfectants, γ2A, and γ2A transfectants was accomplished by substitution of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for serum in their respective culture media for 16–20 h before experiments. Unless otherwise noted, stimulations were performed at 37 °C. Details of the hGH (at indicated concentrations) and PMA (at 1 μg/ml) treatment protocols have been described previously (14Zhang Y. Jiang J. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4342-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Guan R. Zhang Y. Jiang J. Baumann C.A. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J.

Physiol. 1997; 273: E932-E941PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for IM-9 cells, cells were stimulated in suspension at 10 million cells/ml in binding buffer (BB). Stimulations were terminated, and cells were collected by centrifugation (800 × g for 1 min at 4 °C) and aspiration of the BB. COS-7 transfectants, CHO transfectants, γ2A cells, and γ2A transfectants were stimulated in confluent 150 × 20-mm dishes (Falcon) in BB. Stimulations were terminated by washing the cells once and harvesting by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate. Pelleted cells were collected by brief centrifugation. For each cell type, pelleted cells were solubilized for 15 min at 4 °C in fusion lysis buffer (FLB), as indicated. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the detergent extracts were electrophoresed under nonreducing or reducing conditions, as indicated. Resolution of proteins under reducing or nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer of proteins, and blocking of Hybond-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 2% bovine serum albumin were performed as described previously (32Zhang Y. Jiang J. Kopchick J.J. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33072-33084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with antibodies 4G10 (1:2000), anti-GHRcyt-AL37 (1:1000), anti-GHRcyt(1:1000), or anti-GHRAL47 (1:1000) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000) and ECL detection reagents (all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stripping and reprobing of blots were accomplished according to the manufacturer's suggestions. GHBP activity was measured in conditioned media by a standard GH binding assay, as reported previously (13Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Baumann G. Shaw M.A. Amburn K. Metabolism. 1989; 38: 683-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium (1 ml) from cells treated as indicated was incubated with freshly labeled 125I-hGH (∼0.5 ng) for 45 min at 37 °C. Bound GH was then immediately separated from free GH by gel chromatography on a Sephadex G-100 column at 4 °C. The fraction of GH bound was determined by peak integration. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t test. Densitometric quantitation of ECL immunoblots was performed using a video camera and the Image 1.49 program (developed by W.S. Rasband; Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). The fractional loss of full-length GHRs in extracts from PMA-treated cells was estimated by measuring the intensity of the GHR signal relative to that present in non-PMA-treated cell extracts from the same experiment. The PMA-induced loss of receptors determined thus in samples not pretreated with GH was considered the maximum (100%) within that particular experiment. PMA-induced GHR loss in the presence of GH was expressed relative to this maximum. PMA-induced GHR remnant accumulation was estimated by subtracting the remnant signal present in non-PMA-treated cell extracts from that present in the PMA-treated cells. Maximum (100%) remnant accumulation within each experiment was that arising from PMA treatment without prior GH stimulation. PMA-induced remnant accumulation in the presence of GH was expressed relative to this maximum. As indicated when graphically shown, pooled data from several experiments are displayed as the mean ± S.E. The significance of differences of pooled results are estimated by unpaired ttests. Proteolytic generation of the GHBP can be detected in both cells that endogenously express GHRs and cells that heterologously express GHRs (13–24). In our previous studies with human IM-9 lymphoblasts and CHO cells stably expressing the rbGHR, we have shown that metalloprotease-mediated GHBP shedding in response to activation of protein kinase C with the phorbol ester PMA is associated with loss of the full-length GHR and accumulation of cell-associated 60–68-kDa cytoplasmic domain-containing remnant proteins (13Alele J.

Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As we observed previously, exposure of CHO-rbGHR cells to PMA for as little as 10 min allowed detection of receptor loss and remnant accumulation by immunoblotting with an antiserum against the GHR cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1 A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Because GHBP shedding has been observed in cells that express GHR isoforms that lack a large portion of the cytoplasmic domain (51Dastot F. Sobrier M.L. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Goossens M. Amselem S.

We previously characterized a rbGHR mutant with an in-frame internal deletion of residues 297–406 (rbGHRdel 297–406) that thus lacks most of the membrane-proximal one-third of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain but has an intact Box B1 (JAK2-binding) region (41Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). rbGHRdel 297–406 binds GH normally, interacts with JAK2, and allows GH-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (41Frank S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2098809038,"Intra-cellular membrane fusion is facilitated by the association of SNAREs from opposite membranes into stable α-helical bundles. Many SNAREs, in addition to their α-helical regions, contain N-terminal domains that likely have essential regulatory functions. To better understand this regulation, we have determined the 2.4-Å crystal structure of the 130-amino acid N-terminal domain of mouse Sec22b (mSec22b), a SNARE involved in endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membrane trafficking. The domain consists of a mixed α-helical/β-sheet fold that resembles a circular permutation of the actin/poly-proline binding protein, profilin, and the GAF/PAS family of regulatory modules. The structure is distinct from the previously characterized N-terminal domain of syntaxin 1A, and, unlike syntaxin 1A, the N-terminal domain of mSec22b has no effect on the rate of SNARE assembly in vitro. An analysis of surface conserved residues reveals a potential protein interaction site. Key residues in this site are distinct in two mammalian Sec22 variants that lack SNARE domains.

Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). Transport between compartments is accomplished by vesicles that accumulate specific cargo and bud from donor membranes. These vesicles are then transported to specific target membranes where they fuse, resulting in the transfer of contents. The machinery that underlies this critical membrane fusion event consists of compartment-specific proteins, which include the solubleNSF attachment protein receptors or SNAREs1 (2Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). As part of the fusion process, cytoplasmic “SNARE domains” from opposed membranes assemble into an elongated, parallel four-helical bundle, termed the core complex (3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 4Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Assembly of the core complex brings the membranes into close apposition, which is believed to lower the energy barrier to fusion (5Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). SNAREs can be divided into subgroups that are homologous to syntaxin 1, VAMP1 and 2 (also termed synaptobrevin), and SNAP-25 (8Weimbs T. Mostov K. Low S.H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Syntaxin and VAMP each contribute a single helix to the core complex and largely localize, via C-terminal membrane anchors, to acceptor and donor membranes, respectively. SNAP-25 contributes two helices to the core complex and is anchored to the membrane by lipid-modified cysteine residues. A large set of regulatory factors tightly controls SNARE assembly and ultimately serves to govern the fidelity and timing of membrane trafficking in the cell (10Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Examples of regulatory factors include the Rab and Sec1 proteins (2Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). At least 60 Rab proteins have been identified in the human genome, many localizing to specific compartments (9Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The neuronal nSec1 may regulate fusion, at least in part, by binding syntaxin 1A on the plasma membrane (11Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). One hypothesis proposes that a Rab·effector complex signals to the nSec1·syntaxin 1A complex that the vesicle is properly docked and ready for fusion (12Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Homologs of Sec1 have been identified that likely interact specifically with other syntaxin family members to regulate different transport steps (2Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 13Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Hyde P.S. Scheller R.H. Gene. 1996; 183: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The nSec1·syntaxin 1A interaction is mediated through both the SNARE domain and an N-terminal three-helical bundle domain of syntaxin (12Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 14Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These observations imply that sequences outside the SNARE domain are required for proper function in the cell and may serve critical regulatory functions. In support of this idea, the N-terminal domain of the syntaxin ortholog yeast Sso1p was recently shown to be necessary for viability (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Many non-syntaxin SNARE proteins also contain discrete N-terminal domains. The sequences of these domains, however, are distinct from syntaxin, perhaps because they regulate processes unique to their particular transport step. For example, the yeast SNAREs Sec9p and Spo20p function with the same syntaxin (Sso1p and 2p) and VAMP (Snc1p and 2p) partners. However, although Sec9p normally operates in vegetative cells, Spo20p is active only during sporulation. Analysis of chimeric Sec9p/Spo20p proteins demonstrated that the unique N terminus of Spo20p was required for activity during sporulation, whereas this domain was found to be inhibitory in vegetative cells (16Neiman A.M. Katz L. Brennwald P.J. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1643-1655PubMed Google Scholar). In the VAMP subfamily, N-terminal sequences vary substantially and are either completely missing (VAMP5 and 8) or are less than 50 amino acids in length (VAMP1, 2, 3, and 4). The two exceptions are VAMP7 (also called TI-VAMP) and Sec22, which contain larger N-terminal domains (∼130 amino acids). Interestingly, deletion of the VAMP7 N-terminal domain was found to strongly stimulate neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells (17Martinez-Arca S. Alberts P. Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and expression of the deleted sequence alone inhibited neurite outgrowth. These data further support the hypothesis that sequences outside the conserved SNARE domains provide important regulatory functions. Sec22 localizes to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the intermediate compartment, and the cis-Golgi and has been proposed to play a role in both anterograde and retrograde trafficking (18Hay J.C.

Rat rSec22b participates in a quaternary complex with three other SNAREs, rbet1, membrin, and syntaxin 5 (22Xu D. Joglekar A.P. Williams A.L. Hay J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39631-39639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Of these four SNAREs, all except rbet1 contain significant N-terminal domains. To begin to understand the functions of these possible regulatory domains, we have undertaken a biophysical and structural characterization of the mouse Sec22b (mSec22b) protein. The N-terminal 127 amino acids of mSec22b form an independently stable domain that consists of a mixed α-helical/β-sheet fold. Unlike syntaxin 1A, this N-terminal domain does not appear to interact with its own SNARE domain and has no effect on the rate of SNARE complex assembly. The structure, although circularly permuted, is similar to the well-characterized protein profilin and the GAF/PAS regulatory modules. Analysis of conserved surface residues within the Sec22 family, suggests that this domain serves as a protein recognition module. The full cytoplasmic domain of mouse Sec22b (amino acids 2–196) containing a N-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed from a pQE-9 vector (Qiagen) in the JM109 strain of Escherichia coli. Cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal media, supplemented with 10 ml/liter Kao Vitamins (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5, methionine synthesis was inhibited by the addition of 100 mg/liter d-lysine,d-phenylalanine, and d-threonine; 50 mg/literd-isoleucine and d-valine; and 60 mg/literd/l-selenomethionine (Sigma) (24Yu R.C. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After 15 min, the cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Calbiochem). Cells were harvested by centrifugation 5 h after induction and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 2.5 ml/g. To minimize selenomethionine oxidation, 25 mml-methionine (Sigma) was added to the lysis buffer, and all lysis and purification buffers were degassed. Lysis by French press was carried out in the absence of protease inhibitors to promote the degradation of the full-length product to the protease resistant N-terminal domain. After clearing the lysate using high speed centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) in batch and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mml-methionine, and 25 mm imidazole then eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. At this point, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (BME) was added, and the sample was concentrated to 2 ml (Millipore) and loaded onto a Superdex S-75 (16/60) size-exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 18 °C pre-equilibrated with 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, and 20 mm BME. Eluted fractions containing pure N-terminal fragment were pooled and concentrated using Ultrafree-4 concentrators (Mr = 5000 molecular weight cut-off) (Millipore) to ∼15 mg/ml. Protein expression and purification, using the glutathioneS-transferase system, of syntaxin 1A (H3) (amino acids 191–266), mSec22b-SNARE domain (amino acids 126–195), and full-length SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–206, with cysteines 85, 88, 90, and 92 all mutated to alanine) have been described elsewhere (25Yang B. Gonzalez Jr., L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For circular dichroism studies, purification of full-length and N-terminal domains of mSec22b was carried out as described above, omitting steps for selenomethionine incorporation. Cells were grown in 2xYT media and induced at an optical density (600 nm) of 0.7. Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out in PBS with 5 mm BME. Proteins were concentrated as described above and quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Initial crystallization conditions were identified from hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C, using the sparse matrix screen (Hampton) (26Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Following optimization, the best crystals were obtained at 4 °C by mixing 1:1 ratios of ∼15 mg/ml protein with reservoir (∼27% polyethylene glycol 1000, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 67 mmsodium Citrate, pH 5.25, 20 mm BME, and 10% glycerol) on siliconized glass coverslips (Hampton). Crystals generally appeared after 1 week and reached full size, on average 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm, after 2 weeks. These conditions were sufficient for cryoprotection of the crystals, which were flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. The crystals belong to space groupP212121, with unit cell dimensions of a = 50.2, b = 57.0, andc = 99.0 Å. After optimization, the crystals diffracted to a minimum Bragg spacing of 2.4 Å. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules, corresponding to a solvent content of 51% as determined by the Matthews coefficient (27Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were measured at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9-2, using a Quantum 4 charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). Data were systematically measured at 100 °K, at three wavelengths, in 22° wedges, using inverse-beam geometry for a total of 84° of data.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The initial model comprised ∼84% of the final model, extending from amino acids 3 to 20 and 30 to 126 (the electron density for 21–29 was initially absent or weak). Strict non-crystallographic symmetry was imposed to generate the second molecule in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was performed using CNS against all data with ‖F‖ > 0 and was monitored by cross-validation (32Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar), using a test set composed of randomly selected data (∼10%). The initial model was refined by simulated annealing, using the MLHL target in CNS against the remote wavelength. Additional rounds of model building followed by minimization were performed. Subsequent models were built using ςa-weighted 2Fo − Fc maps and refined using the MLF target. Individual thermal factors were refined, followed by relaxation of the non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Further cycles of model building and positional minimization, including 64 water molecules and 2 glycerol molecules, produced the final structure. The model statistics are shown in TableIII. All residues from 2 to 127 are included in the model. Amino acids 23 to 27 were poorly represented in the electron-density maps and consequently have relatively high thermal factors. A number of side chains appear to be disordered in both molecules and were modeled as alanine, including Asp23, Arg28, Gln31, Gln47, Lys82, Lys101, Arg108, and Lys121.

Open table in a new tab Circular dichroism (CD) data were recorded on an Aviv 62DS CD spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Measurements were made in PBS buffer, using either a 0.1- or 1-cm path-length quartz cuvette. Wavelength measurements were recorded at 18 °C, using 15 μm protein or 60 μm for the mSec22 SNARE domain. Thermal unfolding experiments were performed at the same protein concentration by measuring the CD signal at 222 nm, allowing 1 min of equilibration per 1 °C temperature increment, averaging 30 s per measurement. Under these conditions, the unfolding transitions were irreversible. The melting temperatures are therefore apparent. Assembly reactions were performed by adding equimolar concentrations (0.8 or 8.0 μm) of the appropriate protein components to the cuvette and mixing thoroughly. Kinetic measurements were recorded at 18 °C by monitoring the CD signal at 222 nm every 10 s with a 5-s averaging time. The full cytoplasmic sequence (amino acids 2–196) of mSec22b (mSec22b-FL) was expressed as an N-terminally His6-tagged fusion construct and purified on Ni2+-agarose beads. During the purification process, mSec22b (22 kDa) was proteolyzed into a smaller ∼14-kDa fragment (mSec22b-NT), corresponding to approximately the first 125 amino acids (confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing). We used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to determine if mSec22b possesses significant amounts of secondary structure. The data showed that the full-length and proteolytic fragment of mSec22b were structured (Fig. 2 A). The measured mean molar ellipticities for both proteins were similar, but also lower than would be expected for a mostly α-helical protein. This suggests that either a fraction of the polypeptide chain was unfolded and/or there was a significant amount of β-sheet structure, which contributes less CD signal than α-helical residues. The lack of clearly defined minima at 208 and 222 nm is consistent with significant β-sheet content. Spectra measured on the isolated SNARE domain of mSec22b (residues 126–195) indicated that the polypeptide chain was predominantly unstructured (Fig. 2 A). In addition, the thermal unfolding of mSec22b-FL and mSec22b-NT were virtually indistinguishable (∼66 °C) (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the C-terminal domain does not significantly stabilize the N-terminal domain. Taken together, these results suggest that mSec22b consists of a possibly unstructured C-terminal SNARE domain and an independently folded and thermally stable, β-sheet containing N-terminal domain. Both the proteolytic fragment and full-length mSec22b were screened in crystallization trials. The full-length protein failed to crystallize, whereas the mSec22b-NT fragment crystallized readily from polyethylene glycol and ammonium sulfate. Selenomethionine was incorporated into the protein, and MAD phasing was used to determine the structure at 2.4-Å resolution (see “Experimental Procedures”). The experimental electron density map was of excellent quality (Fig. 1, A and B), clearly showing the presence of α-helices and β-strands. The overall structure consists of a five-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet and three flanking α-helices (Fig.3, A and B,i). The domain is roughly globular with dimensions of ∼30 × 30 × 30 Å. The fold begins with a β-hairpin (β1–β2), followed by a single helix (α1) that spans one face of the β-sheet, then leads into a three-stranded β-meander that completes the β-sheet. The remainder of the chain folds into a pair of anti-parallel α-helices that packs on one side of the β-sheet platform. The β-sheet gently curves around the straight α1 helix (Fig. 3 B, ii), and the α2 and α3 helices accommodate the β-sheet curvature by matching their relative helix-helix packing angle with the slope of the β-sheet. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit are related by a ∼90° rotation and bury 1195 Å2 of surface area, which represents 10% of the total surface area of the crystallographic dimer. However, size-exclusion chromatography and native gel analysis indicate that mSec22b-NT does not dimerize in solution (data not shown). The interface consists of an acceptor pocket composed of residues between β3 and α1, and a donor loop (residues 108–113) and the outside surface of α3. Each mSec22b-NT monomer acts as an acceptor and a donor, generating a continuous fiber in the crystal lattice. Apart from the Sec22 or VAMP7 orthologs and variants, there are no sequences significantly homologous to mSec22b-NT in the current genome data bases. Nonetheless, the three-dimensional structure might display similarity to a known structure in the Protein Data Bank, which could suggest a function. Therefore, we performed a search for structural homologs using the DALI server (33Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). A significant match was detected to the protein profilin (Z score = 6.4). The structural similarity between the two proteins spans about 66% of the mSec22b-NT sequence, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for Cα atoms of 2.6 Å (Fig.4, A and B). The majority of the structural similarity lies in the five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and the pair of anti-parallel helices. The two folds, although topologically similar, are circular permutations of each other. Profilin is involved in regulating actin filament assembly and binds monomeric actin (34Wolven A.K. Belmont L.D. Mahoney N.M. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Profilin also binds to proline-rich regions of specific scaffolding proteins and, in this way, localizes to areas of actin filament assembly (35Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interaction of profilin with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) has also been reported (36Sohn R.H. Chen J. Koblan K.S. Bray P.F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21114-21120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Based on the structural similarity, we asked if mSec22b-NT displays functional similarities to profilin. First, could mSec22b-NT bind to PIP2? The biophysical details of the PIP2·profilin interaction have remained obscure. Nevertheless, we would expect that if mSec22b-NT harbors a PIP2 interaction site, a conserved electropositive binding pocket, which is apparent in other PIP2 or phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding domains, would be identifiable. Analysis of the surface features revealed no evidence for such a binding site; on the contrary, the electrostatic surface potential is mainly acidic (see below). Therefore, we do not consider interaction with PIP2 likely. Poly-l-proline binds profilin in a groove between the two anti-parallel helices, interacting with highly conserved aromatic residues (Fig. 4 B) (37Mahoney N.M. Rozwarski D.A. Fedorov E. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). If mSec22b-NT binds poly-l-proline in a similar manner, we would expect to find aromatic residues at these positions. There are indeed four phenylalanine residues and one tyrosine residue between the anti-parallel helices of mSec22b-NT that are conserved within the Sec22 family. In profilin, however, the two anti-parallel helices are not closely packed with each other, but instead pack independently on the surface of the β-sheet, providing a clear binding groove. In mSec22b-NT, the aromatic residues are partly involved in close helix-helix packing interactions. Thus, it is unclear whether mSec22b-NT could accommodate a poly"

Mammalian MAPKs are divided into at least three subfamilies (ERKs, p38s, and JNKs) based on degree of homology, biological activities, and phosphorylation motif (1Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M.

Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Although highly homologous in structure and in pattern of activation, each MAPK is activated in response to a specific battery of signals and in turn phosphorylates a particular array of substrates. As a result, each MAPK imposes specific effects on the cell. For example, in many cell lines (e.g. fibroblasts), the ERK MAPKs are activated when cells are exposed to growth factors, and their activation is important for enhancement of cell proliferation (7Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 8Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). In other cells (neuronal and myogenic cell lines), however, activation of ERKs is associated with growth arrest and differentiation (7Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 9Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ERK enzymes, the activity of p38 and JNK MAPKs is only slightly induced by growth factors. These enzymes are strongly activated in response to stress signals such as heat shock, osmotic shock, UV radiation, cytokines, and metabolic inhibitors. JNK and p38 MAPKs seem to be responsible mainly for protective responses, stress-dependent apoptosis, and inflammation (3Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Although many aspects of MAPK biology have been revealed, the exact role of each MAPK in a given biological system is not fully understood and is difficult to study. The main reason for this difficulty is our inability to activate a given MAPK in vivo and to follow the biochemical and physiological consequences. Currently, a MAPK is experimentally activated in vivo using extracellular stimuli or through expression of an active form of a component that functions upstream to that MAPK (7Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 8Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Each of these treatments activates more than one MAPK and evokes many cellular responses. Activation of a given MAPK per se could be obtained theoretically by expressing an active form of this kinase, which would be active independently of external signals and upstream components. However, the catalytic activity of MAPKs is tightly regulated and strictly dependent on upstream activation (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Although the mechanisms of MAPK activation have been revealed (2, 20, 21; see below), this knowledge could not be applied for the production of active forms of MAPKs. Here we describe a novel genetic screening system, which produces and isolates such active kinases. Following exposure of cells to an extracellular ligand, the activity of the relevant MAPK increases ∼1000-fold (18Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activation is mediated through a complex signal transduction net that culminates in phosphorylation of the MAPK by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK). MAPKKs are dual specificity kinases that phosphorylate MAPKs on particular Thr and Tyr residues. This dual phosphorylation is the basis for the dramatic increase in MAPK activity. MAPKs mutated in either the Thr or Tyr phosphoacceptors cannot be activated (18Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The unusual mode of MAPK activation (through dual phosphorylation) underlies the difficulties in producing active forms of these enzymes, because a PO4-Thr-X-PO4-Tyr structure is difficult or impossible to mimic by mutagenesis (18Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the crystal structure of ERK2 with that of dually phosphorylated ERK2 (21Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) shows that phosphorylation of the activation loop induces conformational changes in both the activation loop itself and in another domain at the COOH-terminal extension (Pro309–Arg358) known as L16. These conformational changes induce tight interactions between the phosphorylation lip and the L16 domain. A recent report suggested that these interactions create an interface for homodimerization of the kinase molecules. The putative dimerization is stabilized by hydrophobic contacts involving mainly leucine residues located at L16 of the two monomers and by an ion pair involving Phe329 and Glu343 (located in L16) of one monomer and His176 of the other monomer (20Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). It is not known whether other MAPKs (e.g. JNKs and p38s) are dimerized upon phosphorylation and activation. Although the crystal structures of ERK2 and phospho-ERK2 revealed the conformational changes that activate the enzyme, they did not suggest a strategy for producing a constitutively active MAPK by mutagenesis. We have devised a novel protocol for isolation of active forms of MAPKs using a genetic screen in yeast. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses five different MAPKs, which are highly homologous to their mammalian counterparts (1Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The yeast MAPKs Fus3, Kss1, and Mpk1 are close to the ERK subfamily. The yeast Hog1 MAPK has a QM*TG*YVSTR phosphorylation motif (almost identical to that of p38) and is functionally replaced by either JNKs (24Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) or p38s (25Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Hog1 is phosphorylated and activated by the MAPKK Pbs2 (26Brewster J. De Valoir T. Dwyer N. Winter E. Gustin M. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), a functional homolog of JNKK1/MKK4 (27Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The Pbs2/Hog1 MAPK cascade is essential for survival of yeast cells under high osmotic conditions. Yeast cells lacking either PBS2 or HOG1 cannot grow on media supplemented with high concentrations of sugar or salt (26Brewster J. De Valoir T. Dwyer N. Winter E. Gustin M. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Our effort to produce active forms of MAPKs took advantage of the Pbs2/Hog1 pathway. We reasoned that it should be possible to screen a library of randomly mutated HOG1 genes in cells lacking Pbs2 activity. The premise is that a HOG1 clone that allows pbs2Δ cells to grow on salt should encode an active, MAPKK-independent Hog1 (see Fig. 1). Previous efforts to obtain active forms of MAPKs were only partially successful. Several gain-of-function mutations that were identified in the S. cerevisiae FUS3 (28Brill J.A. Elion E.A. Fink G.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) seems more useful. Yet, in the in vivo situation, MAPKKs and MAPKs are not colocalized in the cell and are differently controlled; thus, the use of the chimeric proteins might be problematic for physiological studies. Hence, despite efforts through various approaches, active forms of MAPKs, which are independent of MAPKK activity, are not available. The approach taken in this study is most stringent, because it screens for MAPKs that are active in the complete absence of their relevant MAPKK. In addition, the design of the screen forces just minor changes in the MAPK (point mutations). We describe the isolation of nine different point mutations in the Hog1 kinase. Each mutation is sufficient to render Hog1 catalytically and biologically active, independent of upstream regulation. Remarkably, insertion of equivalent mutations to the human p38α rendered this enzyme catalytically active also. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study were the pbs2Δ strainMAY1 (MATa, ura3–52,lys2–801amber,ade2–101ochre, leu2-Δ1,his3-Δ200,pbs2-Δ2::LEU2), thehog1Δ strain JBY13 (MATa,leu2, ura3, his3, trp1,ade2, lys2,hog1::TRP1), andhog1Δpbs2Δ (JBY13, in which the PBS2 gene was disrupted). The JBY13 andMAY1 strains were obtained from M. Gustin (Rice University, Houston, TX). The hog1Δpbs2Δ strain was produced in this study. Cultures were maintained on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto Peptone, 2% glucose) or on the synthetic medium YNB-URA (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and NH4(SO4)2, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 40 mg/liter adenine, histidine, tryptophan, lysine, leucine, and methionine). The ability of cells to grow under osmotic shock was tested on YPD plates supplemented with NaCl (salt concentrations are described for each experiment). To induce osmotic shock in liquid media, cultures were grown to logarithmic phase (A 600 of 0.5–1.0) at 30 °C. Cells were split in half, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in the same media or in media containing 1m NaCl. Cells were collected 10 min later. The library of HOG1mutants was produced in bacterial strain LE30 according to Silhavyet al. (34Silhavy, T. J., Berman, M. L., Enquist, L. W. (1984) pp. 75–78, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). A plasmid carrying the HOG1 andURA3 genes (pRS426-HOG1 obtained from M. Gustin) was introduced into LE30 cells. About 50,000 colonies were obtained and allowed to grow on LB ampicillin plates for 24 h. All colonies were collected in a pool into 1 liter of LB medium (containing ampicillin) and further grown for 12 h. Then, the culture was diluted 1:5 and further grown for 15 h prior to plasmid preparation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by polymerase chain reaction or with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.

Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were plated on selective YNB-URA plates. Colonies that grew (about 10,000 per 100-mm plate) were replica-plated onto YPD plates containing different concentrations of NaCl (0.9, 1.1, and 1.3 m). Plasmid loss assay, for positive colonies, was performed by streaking patches of positive colonies on YPD plates, allowing the colonies to grow for 24 h, and isolating single colonies. These single colonies were replica-plated onto YNB-URA plates as well as onto NaCl-containing YPD plates. Cells were grown in 100 ml of YNB-URA to an A 600 of 0.5–0.9, split, and collected by centrifugation. Half of the cells were induced for 90 min with YNB-URA containing 1 m NaCl, whereas the other half of the cells were resuspended in YNB-URA. After induction, cells were centrifuged and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA preparation, primer extension analysis, and sequences of the primers were previously described (36Engelberg D. Zandi E. Parker C.S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Stanhill A. Schick N. Engelberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7529-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 50-ml cell cultures were grown to anA 600 of 0.5–1.0. Half of the culture was induced with 1 m NaCl for 10 min, as described above. Cultures were pelleted and resuspended in 8 ml of water and 10 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After the samples were repelleted, they were resuspended in 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid at room temperature, and 650-mg of glass beads were added. Each sample was vortexed twice for 4 min each time. Supernatants were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes, and glass beads were rinsed twice with 200 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid (the final concentration of trichloroacetic acid was 10%). Following centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by addition of 100 μl of 1 m Tris base. Samples were vortexed for 30 s and boiled for 3 min prior to centrifugation. Supernatant was used. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot, and ECL reaction for identification of the HA-Hog1 protein and the phosphorylated Hog1 were performed as described in Sambrook et al. (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The antibody for the HA tag, 12CA5, is monoclonal. A dilution of 1:1000 was used. For identification of the double phosphorylated Hog1, α-P-p38 antibodies (New England Biolabs) were used (diluted 1:2,500). The secondary antibodies, anti-mouse and anti-rat, respectively, were diluted 1:10,000. 200-ml cell cultures were grown to anA 600 of 0.5–1.0. After a 10-min induction with 1 m NaCl, as described above, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed with 50 ml of ice-cold water. Following centrifugation the pellet was resuspended in 1–2 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 313 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmμ-glycerol-P). 600 mg of glass beads were added, and the pellet was vortexed eight times for 1 min each time. Samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were aliquoted to small volumes (∼200 μl) and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. For immunoprecipitation of the Hog1 protein, 40 μl of 50% protein A were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and preconjugated with 5 μl of 12CA5 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then one with lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in lysis buffer, and 300 μg of the lysate were added. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, three washes with lysis buffer followed by three washes with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm μ-glycerol-P, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were performed. The kinase reaction was performed by resuspending the beads in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 9 μg of GST-ATF2 as a substrate. The experimental details on optimizing the conditions for the Hog1 in vitro kinase assay, kinetic parameters, and affinities to substrates are described elsewhere. The reaction took place at 30 °C for 30 min and was stopped by transferring the samples to ice and adding 10 μl of Laemmli loading buffer ×4 prior to boiling. Kinase reactions were separated through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film. Wild type and active mutants of p38α were expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET15b expression vector (Novagen) so that all proteins contained a polyhistidine tag in their NH2terminus. Growth conditions, induction of expression, and protein purification were performed according to Wang et al. (39Wang Z. Harkins P.C. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were assayed as previously described (40Jiang Y. Li Z. Schwarz E.M. Lin A. Guan K. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11096-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using GST-ATF2 (20 μg) as a substrate. Our screen for active forms of MAPKs takes advantage of thepbs2Δ strain, which lacks the MAPKK Pbs2 and cannot grow under high osmotic conditions. Overexpression of the MAPK Hog1 (the Pbs2 target) did not enable pbs2Δ cells to grow on salt (see Fig. 2A; second row in each plate), demonstrating the absolute dependence of Hog1 activity on Pbs2-mediated phosphorylation. This result forms the basis for our premise that only an active, independent form of Hog1 might enable pbs2Δcells to grow on salt. The idea is therefore to produce a library ofHOG1 mutants, hoping that one mutant or a few mutants would gain intrinsic catalytic activity, which is independent of Pbs2 activation. The rare active mutants will be identified by introducing the library to pbs2Δ cells and selecting colonies on salt. Each colony that grows should harbor an active, Pbs2-independent Hog1 kinase (Fig. 1). A library of HOG1 mutants was produced (34Silhavy, T. J., Berman, M. L., Enquist, L. W. (1984) pp. 75–78, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar, 41Michaeli T. Field J. Ballester R. O'Neill K. Wigler M.

Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). 5 × 105 transformants were obtained and allowed to grow on selective media (YNB with no uracil) with no salt. Then colonies were replica-plated to plates supplemented with NaCl (0.9–1.3m). 150 positive colonies (colonies that grew on salt concentrations of 1.1 m NaCl or higher) were collected. The linkage between growth on salt and the library plasmid was verified through a plasmid loss assay and then by retransfection (following purification from yeast) to pbs2Δ cells. 41 clones passed these tests (data not shown) and were considered true positives (Table II). Fig.2A shows that the Hog1 mutants isolated, but not wild type Hog1, enable pbs2Δcells to grow on salt.Table IIScreen resultsNo. of colonies% of transformantsTotal colonies obtained5 × 105100Total positives1500.03True positives410.0082Mutation identityNo. of colonies harboring the mutationY68H4D170A1A314T2-aFor unknown reasons, two mutants, N391D and A314T, were not able to rescue pbs2Δ cells when expressed from a strong promoter and containing an HA tag.

Therefore these mutants were studied only in some of the further experiments. Open table in a new tab The 41 true positive clones were sequenced. Each clone was found to contain a single point mutation in the coding sequence of Hog1. Many of the clones harbor an identical mutation (Table II), suggesting that the screen was saturated. Altogether, nine different point mutations were identified (Table II; Figs. 2A and 3). To show unequivocally that each of these point mutations is sufficient to render Hog1 independent of Pbs2, we introduced, through site-directed mutagenesis, each mutation to a wild type HOG1 gene and expressed the resulting mutants in pbs2Δ cells. All nine mutations allowed growth on salt, showing that indeed each point mutation is sufficient to make Hog1 independent of Pbs2. The results shown so far demonstrate that the HOG1 variants isolated in the screen are independent of Pbs2. Because MAPKs may be active as dimers (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), the possibility remains that the mutants are not exclusively independent but dimerize with the endogenous Hog1 that is expressed in the pbs2Δ strain. We therefore tested the ability of the active mutants to allow thepbs2Δhog1Δ double knockout strain to grow on salt. Obviously, this strain is not rescued by overexpression of either Hog1 or Pbs2 (Fig. 2B). Yet, it is rescued by the Hog1 mutants (Fig. 2B), showing that they are active biologically, functioning alone, independently of Pbs2 and endogenous Hog1. To verify that the active Hog1 mutants rescue pbs2Δ cells by activating the authentic biochemical pathway downstream to Hog1, we measured mRNA levels of GPD1 and GPP2 genes. The products of these genes are involved in gl"

Here we show that PP7 coat protein is a specific RNA-binding protein, capable of repressing the translation of sequences fused to the translation initiation region of PP7 replicase. Its RNA binding activity is specific since it represses the translational operator of PP7, but does not repress the operators of the MS2 or Qβ phages. Conditions for the purification of coat protein and for the reconstitution of its RNA binding activity from disaggregated virus-like particles were established. Its dissociation constant for PP7 operator RNA in vitro was determined to be about 1 nm. Using a genetic system in which coat protein represses translation of a replicase-β-galactosidase fusion protein, amino acid residues important for binding of PP7 RNA were identified.

They shut off viral replicase synthesis by binding an RNA hairpin that contains the replicase ribosome binding site. Recent x-ray structure determination of RNA phages shows that homologies evident from comparisons of coat protein amino acid sequences are reflected in their tertiary structures (1Golmohammadi R.

The coat protein dimer, which is both the repressor and the basic building block of the virus particle, consists of two intertwined monomers that together form a large β-sheet surface upon which the RNA is bound. Each of the coat proteins uses a common structural framework to bind different RNAs, thereby presenting an opportunity to investigate the basis of specific RNA-protein recognition. In previous work we characterized the RNA binding sites of MS2, GA, and Qβ coat proteins (8Peabody D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9006-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21845-31839Google Scholar). Here we describe the RNA binding properties of the coat protein of PP7, an RNA bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeroginosa whose coat protein shows only 13% amino acid sequence identity to that of MS2. We present the following findings. 1) The coat protein of PP7 is a translational repressor. 2) An RNA hairpin containing the PP7 replicase translation initiation site is specifically bound by PP7 coat protein both in vivo andin vitro, indicating that this structure represents the translational operator. 3) The RNA binding site resides on the coat protein β-sheet. A map of this site is presented.DISCUSSIONOur experiments demonstrate that the RNA hairpin shown in Fig. 1is indeed a target for binding by PP7 coat protein. It is a functional translational operator in vivo (Table I) and is bound with aKd of about 1 nm in vitro(Fig. 5). Thus, it seems that, like the other RNA phages, PP7 probably utilizes coat protein to translationally repress replicase synthesis.The structure of the PP7 operator differs significantly from those of other RNA phages characterized previously, and neither the MS2 nor Qβ coat proteins efficiently repressed translation from the PP7 operator. Moreover, PP7 coat protein showed little ability to repress the operators of these other phages. Thus, the interaction is specific and represents an example of the ability of the coat protein structural framework to adapt by mutation to the binding of different RNAs. Future studies will determine which features of RNA structure are necessary for interaction with PP7 coat protein.The protein-RNA interaction shows little dependence on salt concentration over the range of 40 mm to 1 m, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are relatively unimportant in stabilizing the PP7 RNA-protein complex. This is a little surprising, given that the RNA binding surface of PP7 coat protein has four basic residues (three arginines and one lysine) and that translational repression is sensitive to substitution at these sites. Moreover, RNA binding by other coat proteins is sensitive to salt. For example, MS2 coat protein, which utilizes five ion pair contacts in its complex with RNA, shows a significant dependence on salt concentration. Its Kd for operator RNA increases about 40-fold as the KCl concentration approaches 1 m (19Carey J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GA and Qβ coat proteins show similar dependences on salt concentration (20Gott J.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21LeCuyer K.A. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6453-6487Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Changing pH over the range 6.2–8.5 also had little effect, indicating that RNA binding is not substantially affected by protonation or deprotonation of any groups with pKa values in this range. Other coat proteins so far characterized exhibit a variety of behaviors with respect to pH. MS2 and GA have broad pH optima centered around pH 7.0 and show only small changes in binding affinity between pH 6.5 and pH 8.0 (19Carey J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Gott J.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Above pH 8.0 the binding affinities of MS2 and GA begin to fall, behavior that has been attributed, at least in the case of MS2, to the deprotonation of Tyr85 (22Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the MS2 RNA-protein complex, Tyr85 is H-bonded through its phenolic hydroxyl to the phosphate of U-5. Substitution with phenylalanine abolishes this pH dependence. RNA binding by Qβ coat protein also exhibits a broad optimum, but it is centered around 6.0 and drops precipitously above pH 8 (21LeCuyer K.A. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6453-6487Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Qβ coat protein has tyrosine at the position 85 equivalent, but the details of its interactions with RNA are as yet unknown. However, this tyrosine presumably participates in binding since substitution with histidine reduces its affinity for RNA about 5-fold (10Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21845-31839Google Scholar). PP7 contains valine at the position 85 homologue.Our mutational analyses provide a map of the PP7 coat protein RNA binding site (Fig. 6). However, it should be noted that this could be an incomplete map for reasons that include the following.(i) Any amino acids that might contribute to the binding site but not targeted for substitution are naturally omitted from this analysis. We directed mutations to amino acids whose structural locations made them likely candidates for RNA-contacting residues, and we cannot rule out the possibility that other amino acids, for example those in the loops that connect β-strands, or in βC or βD, might play a role in RNA binding.(ii) We also point out that substitution of a non-RNA-contacting residue might sometimes cause a failure to bind RNA. For example, a substitution may result in the introduction of a larger amino acid than wild type, thus interfering sterically with RNA binding. However, at only three positions (Ala52, Asp60, and Val83) did we fail to isolate substitutions whose side chains are smaller than the wild-type residue. It is also possible that the substituted amino acid could alter the conformation of a true RNA-contacting residue, affecting RNA binding secondarily. These limitations are inherent in the approach utilized here and emphasize the importance of structural studies as a companion to genetics and biochemistry.(iii) Since our method includes a screen for assembly of ethidium bromide stainable capsids, any amino acid whose substitution always results in a folding or stability defect, or which causes failure to encapsidate host RNAs, would be invisible to this analysis. However, none of the sites we targeted on the coat protein surface failed to yield at least one mutant that satisfied this requirement.(iv) Any mutations that were to increase the nonspecific affinity of coat protein for RNA might produce a repressor-defective phenotype by increasing the competitive effects of host RNAs.It is instructive to compare the binding site of PP7 with that of MS2, whose complex with RNA is understood in great detail and was dealt with in a recent review (23Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Many of the amino acids that make up the two sites are located in homologous positions on their respective β-sheets. However, only 5 of the 15 amino acids on the surfaces of the E, F, and G β-strands of the two proteins are identical (TableIII). Three of these are at positions 41, 43, and 58 (PP7 numbering), amino acids whose identities are highly conserved among coat proteins generally. In MS2 it is easy to understand their significance to the interaction with RNA; these amino acids are involved in important interactions with A-10 and A-4 in the translational operator. However, our results show that translational repression by PP7 is tolerant of substitution of two of these residues, Thr41 and Ser43. Given the striking divergence of their RNA binding site sequence requirements, and considering the obvious differences in their translational operators, it seems likely that MS2 and PP7 use somewhat different modes of RNA binding.Table IIIAmino acids present on the surfaces of β-strands E, F, and G of MS2 and PP7 coat proteinsβEβFβGMS2434547495557596163658385878991KTSRNKTKEPRYNETRTSRARNKDATVSDTPP7394143455254565860628183858789Shown in bold are amino acids whose substitution is known to result in a translational repressor defect. Open table in a new tab Of course it is important to remember that the maps shown here are, in actuality, composites of two sites. The 2-fold symmetry of the dimer means that the RNA ligand may bind in either of two orientations. The makeup of a single, asymmetric site has already been determined for MS2 on the basis of heterodimer complementation experiments and by direct structural analysis of the RNA-protein complex, but similar information is not yet available for PP7.It is striking that the coat protein-operator RNA interaction is conserved across a broad evolutionary spectrum of RNA phages. Thus, the translational repressor and its RNA target represent members of a co-evolving pair; mutations in one are compensated for by changes in the other so as to preserve the interaction. Clearly, retention of this RNA-protein interaction is important to these phages generally. This is also indicated by the observation that, although the coat protein-operator RNA interaction apparently is not absolutely required for virus viability, MS2 mutants with operator-inactivating mutations suffer a growth disadvantage compared with wild-type (24Peabody D.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Licis N. Balklava Z. Van Duin J. Virology. 2000; 271: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for the importance of this interaction include the following. (i) Replicase overproduction might reduce virus burst size by unnecessarily taxing the protein synthetic apparatus of the cell. (ii) The interaction may aid in recognition of viral RNA for selective encapsidation. (iii) Translational repression might serve to clear the replicase cistron of ribosomes, thereby facilitating genome replication or packaging. Any or all of these explanations may apply, as well as others we have not yet imagined.The RNA phage coat proteins provide a structural platform upon which a diversity of RNA structures can be bound. Although the translational operators of the various RNA phages share some common features (i.e. they are all stem-loop structures with bulged adenosines), the length of the stem, the size of the loop, and the position and importance of the bulge vary. For at least one coat protein-RNA interaction (Qβ), deletion of the bulge has only a modest effect on binding, whereas, for others (MS2 and GA), the bulge is essential. Although at present it is unknown how far the RNA binding specificity of coat protein can be made to diverge from these natural examples, we suggest that the coat protein β-sheet presents a surface adaptable to the binding of many different RNAs, some of which could differ substantially from any of the natural RNA targets so far characterized. Work currently under way seeks to address this issue. The coat proteins of several single-strand RNA bacteriophages are known translational repressors. They shut off viral replicase synthesis by binding an RNA hairpin that contains the replicase ribosome binding site. Recent x-ray structure determination of RNA phages shows that homologies evident from comparisons of coat protein amino acid sequences are reflected in their tertiary structures (1Golmohammadi R.

Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The coat protein dimer, which is both the repressor and the basic building block of the virus particle, consists of two intertwined monomers that together form a large β-sheet surface upon which the RNA is bound. Each of the coat proteins uses a common structural framework to bind different RNAs, thereby presenting an opportunity to investigate the basis of specific RNA-protein recognition. In previous work we characterized the RNA binding sites of MS2, GA, and Qβ coat proteins (8Peabody D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9006-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21845-31839Google Scholar). Here we describe the RNA binding properties of the coat protein of PP7, an RNA bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeroginosa whose coat protein shows only 13% amino acid sequence identity to that of MS2. We present the following findings. 1) The coat protein of PP7 is a translational repressor. 2) An RNA hairpin containing the PP7 replicase translation initiation site is specifically bound by PP7 coat protein both in vivo andin vitro, indicating that this structure represents the translational operator. 3) The RNA binding site resides on the coat protein β-sheet. A map of this site is presented. DISCUSSIONOur experiments demonstrate that the RNA hairpin shown in Fig. 1is indeed a target for binding by PP7 coat protein. It is a functional translational operator in vivo (Table I) and is bound with aKd of about 1 nm in vitro(Fig. 5). Thus, it seems that, like the other RNA phages, PP7 probably utilizes coat protein to translationally repress replicase synthesis.The structure of the PP7 operator differs significantly from those of other RNA phages characterized previously, and neither the MS2 nor Qβ coat proteins efficiently repressed translation from the PP7 operator. Moreover, PP7 coat protein showed little ability to repress the operators of these other phages. Thus, the interaction is specific and represents an example of the ability of the coat protein structural framework to adapt by mutation to the binding of different RNAs. Future studies will determine which features of RNA structure are necessary for interaction with PP7 coat protein.The protein-RNA interaction shows little dependence on salt concentration over the range of 40 mm to 1 m, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are relatively unimportant in stabilizing the PP7 RNA-protein complex. This is a little surprising, given that the RNA binding surface of PP7 coat protein has four basic residues (three arginines and one lysine) and that translational repression is sensitive to substitution at these sites. Moreover, RNA binding by other coat proteins is sensitive to salt. For example, MS2 coat protein, which utilizes five ion pair contacts in its complex with RNA, shows a significant dependence on salt concentration. Its Kd for operator RNA increases about 40-fold as the KCl concentration approaches 1 m (19Carey J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GA and Qβ coat proteins show similar dependences on salt concentration (20Gott J.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21LeCuyer K.A. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6453-6487Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Changing pH over the range 6.2–8.5 also had little effect, indicating that RNA binding is not substantially affected by protonation or deprotonation of any groups with pKa values in this range. Other coat proteins so far characterized exhibit a variety of behaviors with respect to pH. MS2 and GA have broad pH optima centered around pH 7.0 and show only small changes in binding affinity between pH 6.5 and pH 8.0 (19Carey J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Gott J.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Above pH 8.0 the binding affinities of MS2 and GA begin to fall, behavior that has been attributed, at least in the case of MS2, to the deprotonation of Tyr85 (22Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the MS2 RNA-protein complex, Tyr85 is H-bonded through its phenolic hydroxyl to the phosphate of U-5. Substitution with phenylalanine abolishes this pH dependence. RNA binding by Qβ coat protein also exhibits a broad optimum, but it is centered around 6.0 and drops precipitously above pH 8 (21LeCuyer K.A. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6453-6487Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Qβ coat protein has tyrosine at the position 85 equivalent, but the details of its interactions with RNA are as yet unknown. However, this tyrosine presumably participates in binding since substitution with histidine reduces its affinity for RNA about 5-fold (10Lim F. Spingola M. Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21845-31839Google Scholar). PP7 contains valine at the position 85 homologue.Our mutational analyses provide a map of the PP7 coat protein RNA binding site (Fig. 6). However, it should be noted that this could be an incomplete map for reasons that include the following.(i) Any amino acids that might contribute to the binding site but not targeted for substitution are naturally omitted from this analysis. We directed mutations to amino acids whose structural locations made them likely candidates for RNA-contacting residues, and we cannot rule out the possibility that other amino acids, for example those in the loops that connect β-strands, or in βC or βD, might play a role in RNA binding.(ii) We also point out that substitution of a non-RNA-contacting residue might sometimes cause a failure to bind RNA. For example, a substitution may result in the introduction of a larger amino acid than wild type, thus interfering sterically with RNA binding. However, at only three positions (Ala52, Asp60, and Val83) did we fail to isolate substitutions whose side chains are smaller than the wild-type residue.

The protein interacts with p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) through its SH3 domain. We examined the effect of βPix on MAP kinase signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. Overexpression of βPix enhanced the activation of p38 in the absence of other stimuli and also induced translocation of p38 to the nucleus. This βPix-induced p38 activation was blocked by coexpression of dominant-negative Cdc42/Rac or kinase-inactive PAK, indicating that the effect of βPix on p38 is exerted through the Cdc42/Rac-PAK pathway and requires PAK kinase activity. The essential role of βPix in growth factor-stimulated p38 activation was evidenced by the blocking of platelet-derived growth factor-induced p38 activation in the cells expressing βPix SH3m (W43K) and βPix DHm (L238R,L239R). In addition, SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, and kinase-inactive p38 (T180A,Y182F) blocked membrane ruffling induced by βPix, suggesting that p38 might be involved in mediating βPix-induced membrane ruffling. The results in this study suggest that βPix might have a role in nuclear signaling, as well as in actin cytoskeleton regulation, and that some part of these cellular functions is possibly mediated by p38 MAP kinase. βPix (PAK-interacting exchange factor) is a recently identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family small G protein Cdc42/Rac.

Among these effectors, the binding partner of Cdc42 and Rac, p21-activated kinase (PAK)1 activity has been linked to Cdc42 and Rac-mediated cytoskeletal changes. The important roles that PAK plays as an effector of Cdc42/Rac signaling have been established from genetic and biochemical studies in yeasts and mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 5Daniels R.

The repertoire of signaling pathways that are responsive to activation by Rho family members is rapidly expanding, and many of these have shown apparent multiplicity of PAK-mediated signaling pathways (7Zohn I.M.

Recently, the PAK-interacting exchange factor (Pix/COOL/p85SPR) family was cloned by several groups, including our laboratory (8Oh W.K. Yoo J.C. Jo D. Song Y.H. Kim M.G. Park D. Biochem. Biophys.

Pix can induce membrane ruffling, with an associated activation of Rac1 (9Manser E. Loo T.-S. Koh C.-G. Zhou Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar); however, the extent and selectivity between Pix isoforms to activate Cdc42 and Rac are not clear (10Bagrodia S.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Pix interacts tightly with the regulatory N terminus of PAK via its SH3 domain. As shown by Daniels et al. (12Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), αPix stimulates PAK kinase activity through exchange factor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Additionally, the guanine nucleotide exchange activity was positively modulated by PAK binding. However, the exact role of Pix in regulating PAK localization and function in the actin rearrangement remains to be clarified. Pix was included in a protein complex containing paxillin, PAK, Nck, and p95PKL (paxillin-kinase linker), a member of ARF-GAP family, and this suggests a possibility for the integration of the ARF and Rho family signal transduction at the cytoskeleton (13Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulus S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 14Bagrodia S.

It was also reported that the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Pix could be activated by direct association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (15Yoshii S.

Interaction of Pix with a variety of signaling proteins suggests that Pix might have an important role in mediating the effects of extracellular signals, e.g. growth factors, extracellular matrix, stress, and cytokine, to cytoskeletal rearrangement. It was reported that Cdc42 and Rac also regulate the JNK/SAPK and p38 signaling pathway and the ability of PAK to regulate these same MAP kinases pathways (16Coso O.A. Chiarello M., Yu, J.-C.

There are several reports showing that Dbl-related proteins, the activators of Rho GTPases, have roles in the regulation of several biological activities, including transformation, metastasis, cytoskeletal reorganization, and transcriptional activation (7Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, relatively little was known of the exact roles of these GEFs in the MAP kinase pathway, whereas Cdc42 and Rac were known as potent SAPK and p38 activators (19Michias F. Stam J.C.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the coincidence of two signalings leading to actin reorganization and MAP kinase activity by Cdc42/Rac/PAK in many cases, there were few reports about cross-talk between these two signalings (22Philips A. Roux P. Coulon V. Bellanger J.-M. Vie A. Vianais M.-L. Blanchard J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5911-5917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that the overexpression of βPix in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells induces activation of p38 through a Cdc42/Rac-PAK-MKK3/6-mediated pathway, and this activation of p38 is necessary for the formation of membrane ruffles induced by βPix overexpression. All materials for culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine calf serum and maintained in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection of cells with mammalian expression vectors was performed using LipofectAMINEPLUS according to manufacturer's instructions. The coding region of βPix was subcloned into pFLAGCMV2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) and pcDNA3.1MycHis (Invitrogen), respectively. pEBB/HA-PAK1 was from Bruce J. Mayer. PAK inhibitory domain (PID: corresponding to 83–149 of hPAK1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using PIDforward (GGAATTCCACACAATTCATGTCGG) and PIDreverse (CGTCTAGATGACTTATCTGTAAAGC) primers, cut withEcoRI and XbaI, and inserted into theEcoRI-XbaI site of HA-linked pcDNA3. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutagenic primers were used: pFLAGCMV2-βPix (W43K), 5′-GTGGAGGAAGGAGGCaaGTGGGAGGGCACACA C-3′ and 5′-GTGTGTGCCCTCCCACttGCCTCCTTCCTCCAC-3′; pFLAGCMV2-βPix (L238R,L239S), 5′-GTCTCTCCAGCTCCTTTgaCaGTGTGGGGTACTT GT-3′ and 5′-ACAAGTACCCCACA CtGtcAAAGGAGCTGGAGAGAC-3′; pEBB/HA-PAK1 (K299R), 5′-CAGGAGGTGGCCATTAgGCAGATGAATCTTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGAAGATTCATCTGCcTAATGGTCACCTCTG-3′; pcDNA3/FLAG-p38 (T180A,Y182F), 5′-CAGATGATGAAATGgCAGGCTtCGTGGCCACTAGGTG-3′ and 5′-CACCTAGTGGCCACGaAGCCTGcCATTTCATCATCTG-3′; pcDNA3/HA-PID (L107F), 5′-AGCAGTGGGCCCGCTTGtTTCAGACATCAAATATC-3′ and 5′-GATATTTGATGTCTGAAaCAAGCGGGCCCACTGCT-3′. Mismatches are indicated by lowercase letters. The mutation was verified by automatic DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems). 35-mm dish-cultured cells were transfected on 0.1% gelatin-coated coverslip. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 16 h before fixation. SB203580 (Calbiochem, Inc.) was treated for 2 h before fixation at 10 μm concentration. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were incubated in 10% goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and 3% bovine serum albumin-containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted as follows: Anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), 5000:1; anti-Myc 9E10 hybridoma culture medium, 200:1; anti-phospho-specific p38 rabbit antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc.), 500:1. Rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was diluted at 2000:1 and treated for 15 min after 1 h primary antibody incubation. Cells were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (100:1, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) was added to VECTASHIELD mounting solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) at 2 μg/ml concentration. Cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope (Axioplan2, Zeiss) equipped with a 63× (1.4 NA) Planapochromat objective lens. Fluorescence micrographs were taken on T-max P3200 film (Kodak). To measure the activities of p38 and Erk, cells on a 100-mm dish were transfected with pcDNA3FLAG-p38 or -Erk together with other mammalian expression vectors of interest. At 40 h after transfection, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1.5 μmpepstatin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Clarified lysates of 500 μg of total protein were incubated with 4 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 4 h, followed by additional incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, once with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol), and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 100 μm ATP, and 4 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-ATF2 (for p38 assay) or MBP (for Erk kinase assay) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was subjected to autoradiography. The same membrane was then washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 containing PBS and immunoblotted using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. After visualization of kinase proteins by ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to normalize the amount of substrates. To visualize active MKK3/6 protein, phosphorylation-specific MKK3/6-specific antibody (500:1) and MKK3 antibody (500:1) were used, respectively (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. The effect of βPix on MAP kinases was examined using NIH3T3 fibroblast cells that were double transfected with FLAG-tagged MAP kinase and Myc-tagged βPix. Transfectants were subject to immune complex kinase assay and phosphorylation of each substrate was visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig.1 A, βPix augmented p38 activity about 3.5 times. We observed similar results in the immunoblotting analysis using phosphorylation-specific p38 antibody (data not shown). βPix had no effect on Erk kinase activity in several separated experiments (Fig. 1 B), and JNK activity was slightly increased upon βPix overexpression (data not shown). Under these conditions, strong activation of Erk kinase by PDGF was observed. Next, we examined the effect of βPix overexpession on the p38 activation in a single cell level using phosphorylation-specific p38 antibody. In βPix-overexpressing cells, we could observe increased phospho-p38 signal, especially in the nucleus, compared with untransfected cells in the same field that had no or very weak signal (Fig. 2, upper panels). The treatment of SB203580, a p38-specific inhibitor, blocked βPix-induced p38 activation (Fig. 2, lower panels).Figure 2Effect of βPix overexpression on p38 activity at a single cell level. NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged βPix. At 40 h after transfection, cells were treated without (Control) or with 10 μm SB203580 for 1 h and then triple-immunofluorescence staining was carried out using anti-Myc, anti-phospho-specific p38 antibodies, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies were used as second antibodies for anti-Myc and anti-p38 antibodies, respectively. Two representative examples of each result are presented. Three independent experiments were performed and two examples representative of all three experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next generated two mutants of βPix, βPix SH3m (W43K) and βPix DHm (L238R,L239S), whose SH3 domain and Dbl-homology domain were changed, respectively. Coimmunoprecipitation assay and glutathioneS-transferase-pulldown assay showed that βPix SH3m cannot bind to PAK (data not shown). βPix DHm has been reported to have no exchange activity, while wild-type βPix acted as a GEF for Rac1in vivo (9Manser E. Loo T.-S. Koh C.-G. Zhou Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type βPix, overexpression of these two mutants failed to activate p38 (Fig.3), indicating that PAK or other SH3 domain-binding proteins and GEF activity of βPix are essential for transmission of the extracellular signaling to p38 MAP kinase activation. p38 has been reported to be activated by several extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and stresses (25Matsumoto T. Yokote K. Tamura K. Tokamoto M. Ueno H. Saito Y. Mori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13954-13960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). We also examined the involvement of βPix in PDGF-induced p38 activation. In βPix-expressing cells, p38 activity was increased about four times upon PDGF treatment (Fig. 3 B, lanesVector and WT). However, in cells expressing βPix SH3m or βPIX DHm, PDGF-induced p38 activation was not evident (Fig. 3 B, lanes W43K and L238R,L239S), suggesting that βPix might mediate p38 activation by PDGF in vivo. However, it should be noted that in either case of βPix SH3m or DHm, expression of mutant βPix still induced membrane ruffling (data not shown). The extent of ruffling was not much different from that of wild-type βPix in case of βPix SH3m and reduced by 20–30% in case of βPix DHm. In contrast, expression of the βPix SH3m-DHm double mutant failed to induce membrane ruffling and also did block PDGF-induced membrane ruffling (data not shown). Results suggest that disruptions of both PAK interaction (SH3) domain and GEF activity are necessary to block βPix-induced membrane ruffling. Blocking the function of either domain was not sufficient to inhibit membrane ruffling. This could be explained by GEF-dependent and -independent PAK activation by Pix (12Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or by the role of PAK as a upstream activator of Rac (27Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. Yen S.C. Hall C. Lim L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of p38 by either βPix SH3m or DHm (Fig. 3) indicates that both PAK interaction (SH3) domain and GEF activity are required for βPix-induced p38 activation. βPix-induced membrane ruffling in the case of βPix SH3m and DHm despite p38 inhibition is probably due to incomplete inhibition of p38 by either mutant. Although βPix SH3m and DHm could block p38 activation by PDGF upstream, the basal p38 activity could concert with other Rac (and/or PAK) effector(s) to induce membrane ruffling. Rho family GTPases regulate JNK and p38, as appeared in the previous reports that the dominant-negative form of Cdc42 or Rac blocked p38 activity and transfection of active Cdc42 or Rac caused a large enhancement of p38 activity (16Coso O.A. Chiarello M., Yu, J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 17Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). To elucidate the hierarchy of Cdc42/Rac and βPix, the effect of dominant-negative (T17N) Cdc42 or Rac1 on the p38 activation by βPix were examined. T17N mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1 completely inhibited βPix-enhanced p38 activation as expected (data not shown), indicating that Cdc42 and Rac1 act downstream of βPix, possibly being activated by the GEF activity of βPix (9Manser E. Loo T.-S. Koh C.-G. Zhou Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The PAK family of protein kinases has been suggested as a main target of the Cdc42/Rac1, and Pix tightly binds to a proline-rich motif of PAK and regulates its kinase activity (9Manser E. Loo T.-S. Koh C.-G. Zhou Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 12Daniels R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). But it is also suggested that PAK could act upstream of Rac1 mediating lamellipodia formation through interaction with Pix (27Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. Yen S.C. Hall C. Lim L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To address the role of PAK in βPix-induced p38 activation, we utilized wild-type PAK1 or the K299R mutant of PAK1 whose kinase activity was eliminated. Immune complex kinase assay after triple transfection of FLAG-tagged p38, HA-tagged wild-type, or mutant PAK1 and Myc-tagged βPix showed that kinase-inactive PAK1 blocked p38 activation induced by βPix (Fig.4 A). To determine whether the blocking of βPix-induced p38 activation by kinase-inactive PAK1 was due to loss of kinase activity or due to dominant-negative effects of the expression of mutant PAK1 that could sequester interacting proteins, we examined βPix-induced p38 activation in cells expressing the PID, which can block endogenous PAK kinase activity (Fig.4 B). Expression of PID abolished βPix-induced p38 activation. Under the same conditions, inactive PID (PID L107F) did not block βPix-induced p38 activation. The results suggest that PAK kinase activity is essential for βPix-induced p38 activation. We next investigated the effect of βPix on MAP kinase kinases, MKK3 and MKK6, which are known to phosphorylate and activate p38 MAP kinase, using phosphorylation-specific MKK3/6 antibody. βPix overexpression led to a large enhancement of MKK3/6 activity (Fig.5).Figure 5βPix overexpression enhanced MKK3/6 activation. NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were transfected with empty vector or Myc-tagged βPix. Cell lysates were analyzed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane, and immunoblotting analysis was accomplished using phospho-specific MKK3/6 (first panel), anti-MKK3 (second panel), and anti-Myc 9E10 (third panel) antibodies, respectively. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been reported that PDGF stimulation of some adherent cells leads to an induction of membrane ruffles in a Rac1 activity-dependent pathway (27Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. Yen S.C. Hall C. Lim L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). When we examined the effect of βPix overexpression on actin structure by double immunofluorescence assay, we found that actin structure modified by βPix overexpression mimicked the PDGF-induced membrane ruffles (Fig.6). 2S.-H. Lee, M. Eom, S. J. Lee, S. Kim, H.-J. Park, and D. Park, unpublished data. In porcine aortic endothelial cells, PDGF treatment enhanced chemotaxis in addition to ruffling, and these effects were blocked by SB203580, suggesting that PDGF-induced membrane ruffling and chemotaxis are dependent on p38 activity (25Matsumoto T. Yokote K. Tamura K. Tokamoto M. Ueno H. Saito Y. Mori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13954-13960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this regard, to test whether βPix-induced membrane ruffle is also mediated by p38 activity or not, we examined the effect of a p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580. As shown in Fig. 6 A, under the βPix-transfected condition, control cells formed enhanced membrane ruffles, whereas 10 μm SB203580-treated cells failed to make membrane ruffles. In addition, the localization of FLAG-tagged βPix was cytoplasmic in the SB203580-treated cells, in sharp contrast with the membrane and edge-localized FLAG-βPix in control cells. We observed similar results in the cells expressing kinase-inactive p38 (T180A,Y182F) (Fig. 6 B,p38AF/βPix). There is now increasing evidence showing the involvement of p38 in actin cytoskeleton regulation and/or cell migration (23Hout J. Houle F. Rousseau Deschesnes R. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PDGF activates p38 through a Ras-dependent pathway that is important for actin reorganization and cell migration in porcine aortic endothelial cells (25Matsumoto T. Yokote K. Tamura K. Tokamoto M. Ueno H. Saito Y. Mori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13954-13960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAP kinase pathway by growth factors and inflammatory cytokines regulates smooth muscle cell migration (24Hodges J.C. Dechert M.A. Yambolieve I.A. Martin J.L. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Gerthorffer W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24211-24219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In this report, p38 activates MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and -3 (MAPKAPK2 and -3), and these kinases phosphorylate various substrates including heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Phosphorylated HSP27 appears to modulate the polymerization of actin and is proposed to play a role in actin cytoskeletal remodeling. In our experiments, SB203580, at the concentration physiologically blocking p38 activity, inhibited βPix-induced membrane ruffling. It seems likely that p38 has a role in mediating Pix/PAK/Cdc42/Rac signaling to the cytoskeletal rearrangement. It is reported that activation of LIM-kinase by PAK1 couples Cdc42/Rac GTPase signaling to actin cytoskeletal dynamics (28Machesky L. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 29Edwards D.C. Sanders L., C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). LIM-kinase is known to catalyze phosphorylation of cofilin, thereby inactivating actin depolymerizing activity and leading to accumulation of actin filaments (30Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 31Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that βPix also acts downstream of p38, where it is proximal to actin structure regulation (Pix-Cdc42/Rac/PAK-LIM kinase-cofilin-actin) and p38 activation is a prerequisite for Pix/PAK/Cdc42/Rac action in actin regulation, rather than downstream of βPix. In many cases, the actin reorganization and MAP kinase activation arose from the same extracellular stimuli, such as the ligands of several receptor tyrosine kinases, and were mediated by the same cytoplasmic signaling components during the signal transduction pathway (16Coso O.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We tested the involvement of βPix in the MAP kinase pathway and found that βPix activates p38 significantly (Fig. 1). It is well established that growth factor stimulation of Ras leads to the activation of the Raf/MEK/Erk pathway, and Ras is also involved in signaling to the cytoskeleton (25Matsumoto T. Yokote K. Tamura K. Tokamoto M. Ueno H. Saito Y. Mori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13954-13960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In recent reports, Erk can be activated by Rho family proteins, and Cdc42/Rac selectively interacts and activates MEK kinases (32Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In our experiment, βPix did not activate Erk kinase activity, excluding the possibility that βPix acts upstream of the Erk-mediated mitogenic signaling pathway in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. It is still unclear whether βPix has a role in the downstream of Ras. Zhang et al. (18Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) proposed that Cdc42 and Rac might regulate p38 activity through the downstream effector, PAK1. In our experiment, kinase-inactive PAK1 blocked p38 activity, supporting the results of others (Refs. 17Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar and 18Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). It is possible that PAK-Pix interaction enhances both kinase activity of PAK and the GEF activity of Pix, as suggested by others (5Daniels R. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 9Manser E. Loo T.-S. Koh C.-G. Zhou Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). βPix might activate PAK, MKK3/6 and p38 in two ways: by activating Cdc42/Rac1 (and effector PAK) through its GEF activity and by interacting directly with the PAK regulatory N terminus. The complexity of the signaling involving βPix might arise from the dual property of βPix, which interacts with the Cdc42/Rac downstream effector, PAK, and also acts as a GEF of Cdc42/Rac1. We propose a model of the Pix/PAK/Rho GTPase-mediated p38 activation signaling pathway that is shown in Fig.7. βPix might be activated by extracellular stimuli such as PDGF, then activate Cdc42 and Rac through its GEF activity. PAK can be activated by Cdc42/Rac binding and also by the interaction with βPix SH3 domain. PAK activates MAPK kinase, MKK3 and/or MKK6, leading to p38 activation. p38 activation has a role in actin cytoskeletal change, such as lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling. It remains to be resolved what is the upstream activator of βPix. Yoshii et al. (15Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Wang D.-Y. Gou R.-J. Zhu Y. Takeda R. Hanai H. Kaneko E. Sugimura H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5680-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) reported that αPix is activated by interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and we also have observed the association between βPix and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in vivo. 3M. Eom and D. Park, unpublished data. We are now investigating other upstream regulators of βPix and extracellular stimuli that activate βPix. Our present study suggests that signaling pathways through βPix, in addition to Cdc42/Rac and PAK, are orchestrated to yield a coordinated response of cytoskeletal and nuclear events to extracellular stimuli."

The muscle isoform was used because it is catalytically active in the b-state. CP-91149 inactivated phosphorylase with sequential activation of glycogen synthase. It increased glycogen synthesis by 7-fold at 5 mm glucose and by 2-fold at 20 mm glucose with a decrease in the concentration of glucose causing half-maximal rate (S0.5) from 26 to 19 mm. Muscle phosphorylase was expressed in hepatocytes mainly in the b-state. Low levels of phosphorylase expression inhibited glycogen synthesis by 50%, with little further inhibition at higher enzyme expression, and caused inactivation of glycogen synthase that was reversed by CP-91149. At endogenous activity, phosphorylase has a very high (greater than unity) negative control coefficient on glycogen synthesis, regardless of whether it is determined by enzyme inactivation or overexpression. This high control is attenuated by glucokinase overexpression, indicating dependence on other enzymes with high control. The high control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis affirms that phosphorylase is a strong candidate target for controlling hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes in both the absorptive and postabsorptive states.

The high control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis affirms that phosphorylase is a strong candidate target for controlling hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes in both the absorptive and postabsorptive states. glucose 6-phosphate The liver maintains blood glucose homeostasis by uptake of glucose in the absorptive state, which is converted to glycogen and triacylglycerol, and by production of glucose from glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the postabsorptive state. Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the first step in glycogen degradation (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is regulated by allosteric mechanisms and by phosphorylation of Ser-14 by phosphorylase kinase. The dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b) is less active than the phosphorylated form (phosphorylase a) (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Hormones that raise cAMP or cytoplasmic Ca2+ favor the formation of phosphorylase a, whereas insulin and leptin have the converse effect (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 2Aiston S. Agius L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase is a dimer and exists in two conformations, an inactive T-state (tight) and an active R-state (relaxed). The R-state is favored by substrate, phosphorylation, and allosteric activators (AMP), whereas the T-state is favored by dephosphorylation and by inhibitors (glucose, glucose 6-P,1 and caffeine) (3Browner M.F. Fletterick R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 66-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Johnson L.N. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The liver isoform, unlike the muscle isoform, is more tightly controlled by phosphorylation than by allosteric regulation (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).Two sets of evidence suggest that liver phosphorylase is a candidate pharmacological target for controlling hyperglycemia in diabetes. Firstly, a potent inhibitor of liver phosphorylase a that acts synergistically with glucose lowers blood glucose in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse (5Martin W.H. Hoover D.J. Armento S.J. Stock I.A. McPherson R.R. Danley D.E. Stevenson R.W. Barrett E.J. Treadway J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1776-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Secondly, the activity of phosphorylase is elevated in the leptin receptor-defective db/db mouse (6Board M. Hadwen M. Johnson L.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Zucker fa/fa rat (7Aiston S. Peak M. Agius L. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which are widely used as animal models for human type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.Recent studies have applied metabolic control analysis (8Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) to determine how control of glycogen synthesis is shared between diverse sites. In skeletal muscle, a high degree of control resides at the glucose transport/phosphorylation sites (9Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Jucker B.M. Barucci N. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E505-E512PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schulz A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas in liver, a high degree of control is exerted by glucokinase in conjunction with its regulatory protein (12Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Aiston S. Trinh K. Lange A.J.

Biophys. 1998; 353: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) developed a minimal model for glycogen synthesis in muscle that demonstrates that as glycogenolysis increases, the distribution of control shifts to the terminal enzymes in the glycogen synthesis pathway. Mathematical models enable identification of conditions that alter the distribution of control but do not allow a quantitative estimate of the degree of control exerted by specific sites. There has been no experimental analysis of the control exerted by phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis. In this study, we used a specific inhibitor of phosphorylase (5Martin W.H. Hoover D.J. Armento S.J. Stock I.A. McPherson R.R. Danley D.E. Stevenson R.W. Barrett E.J. Treadway J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1776-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and titrated phosphorylase overexpression by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the muscle isoform of phosphorylase (15Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the flux control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes. Muscle phosphorylase b, unlike liver phosphorylase b (16Stalmans W. Gevers G. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is very sensitive to activation by AMP. We took advantage of this property of muscle phosphorylase to increase phosphorylase catalytic activity in hepatocytes independently of the phosphorylation state of the hepatocyte.DISCUSSIONMetabolic control analysis is a powerful analytical approach to describe how control of flux through a metabolic pathway is distributed among enzymes that have direct or indirect effects on pathway flux (8Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The flux control coefficient of an enzyme is a measure of the sensitivity of metabolic flux to small changes in enzyme activity or concentration. Heinrich and Rapoport (25Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) defined the control strength in terms of the fractional change in flux that results from a fractional change in enzyme activity, whereas Kacser and Burns (26Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar) defined the sensitivity coefficient in terms of the fractional change in flux that results from a fractional change in enzyme concentration. If the enzyme rate is proportional to the enzyme concentration, then the two definitions are equivalent. However, when an enzyme is regulated by covalent modification, as in the case of liver phosphorylase (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), then the relevant coefficient for determining the degree of control on pathway flux is expressed in terms of the activity of the enzyme. The control coefficient usually has a value between zero (minimum control) and unity (high control) and is either positive or negative, depending on whether the enzyme stimulates or inhibits pathway flux. Enzymes with control coefficients greater than unity are considered to be rare (23Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In muscle, a high degree of control of glucose utilization lies at or before glucose phosphorylation (9Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Jucker B.M. Barucci N. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E505-E512PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schulz A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and in liver high degree of control lies at glucose phosphorylation (12Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Aiston S. Trinh K. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Agius L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, glucokinase has a high control coefficient on glycogen synthesis, which is glucose-dependent. This is explained by the unique compartmentation of glucokinase that involves glucose-dependent partitioning of the enzyme between a free active state and an inactive state bound to its regulatory protein (12Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,14De la Iglesia N. Mukhtar M. Seoane J. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The stimulation of glycogenic flux by an increase in glucokinase activity by either translocation (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or enzyme overexpression (27Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is at least in part explained by the increase in glucose 6-P concentration (11Schulz A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the product of the glucokinase-catalyzed reaction, which is a potent activator of glycogen synthase (28Guinovart J.J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Seoane J. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaro S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphatase, which lowers the concentration of glucose 6-P in hepatocytes, has a negative control coefficient on glycogen synthesis (13Aiston S. Trinh K. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24559-24566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in contrast with glucokinase, the control coefficient of glucose 6-phosphatase is much lower than unity and is glucose-independent, confirming that the high control coefficient of glucokinase and its glucose dependence are best explained by the subcellular compartmentation of glucokinase and its association with its regulatory protein (14De la Iglesia N. Mukhtar M. Seoane J. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The recent findings that stimulation of glycogen synthesis by leptin is associated with inactivation of phosphorylase (2Aiston S. Agius L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that impaired glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes from fa/fa rats is associated with elevated phosphorylase activity (7Aiston S. Peak M. Agius L. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) raised the question of the degree of control of glycogen synthesis by phosphorylase activity. In this study, we demonstrate that phosphorylase has a very high negative flux control coefficient on glycogen synthesis, based on two independent approaches (titration with a specific phosphorylase inhibitor and expression of the muscle isoform of phosphorylase).Three key findings emerged from the studies with phosphorylase inhibitor CP-91149. First, it caused time-dependent inactivation of phosphorylase a and sequential activation of glycogen synthase. This is analogous to the mechanism proposed by Stalmans et al. (22Stalmans W. De Wulf H. Hue L. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) for the glucose-induced inactivation of phosphorylase and sequential activation of glycogen synthase. Binding of glucose to phosphorylase a causes a conformational change (R-state to T-state) that renders the enzyme a better substrate for dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1. Glucose thus favors the conversion of phosphorylase a to phosphorylase b. Because phosphorylase a is a potent inhibitor of glycogen synthase phosphatase by binding to the C terminus of the liver-specific glycogen-targeting subunit (GL) of protein phosphatase-1 (29Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the decrease in phosphorylase a alleviates the inhibition of synthase phosphatase. This results in a delayed activation of glycogen synthase relative to the inactivation of phosphorylase, which has been described as the “sequential activation of synthase” (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 22Stalmans W. De Wulf H. Hue L. Hers H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The present results support a model whereby CP-91149 favors the T-conformation of phosphorylase and thereby causes the inactivation of phosphorylase and sequential activation of synthase. Second, the phosphorylase inhibitor markedly increases the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to glucose (S0.5, 19versus 26 mm) by causing a greater fold stimulation of glycogen synthesis at 5 mm glucose than at 20 mm glucose. This is consistent with the higher activity of phosphorylase a at low glucose and the greater fractional inactivation by the inhibitor at low glucose. The rate of glucose phosphorylation in hepatocytes is a sigmoidal function with respect to [glucose] but with a higher S0.5 for glucose than can be explained by glucokinase kinetics (20 versus 9 mm) (31Bontemps F. Hue L. Hers H.-G. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This higher S0.5 for glucose phosphorylation in the intact cell is explained by the glucokinase regulatory protein, which functions as a competitive inhibitor with respect to glucose and as a nuclear receptor for the enzyme (32Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 33Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthesis has a higher S0.5 for glucose than glucose phosphorylation in intact cells (33Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The inhibitor studies show that phosphorylase is a major component of the mechanism that accounts for the difference in glucose saturation curves of glycogen synthesis and glucose phosphorylation. Third, the titrations with increasing concentration of inhibitor show a large fractional increase in glycogen synthesis for a corresponding inactivation of phosphorylase, with a control coefficient greater than unity.We show in this study that muscle phosphorylase expressed using recombinant adenovirus is a powerful tool to alter the catalytic activity of phosphorylase in hepatocytes independently of the cAMP status and/or the phosphorylation state of the cell. In the absence of glucagon, muscle phosphorylase is expressed mainly in the unphosphorylated (b) form. However, it is partially catalytically active at physiological concentrations of AMP and ATP, unlike liver phosphorylase b (16Stalmans W. Gevers G. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and this enables determination of the flux control coefficient of phosphorylase in defined substrate and hormone conditions. By using low titers of adenovirus that result in small fractional changes in phosphorylase activity and a short culture time after treatment with the adenovirus (<20 h), secondary changes in gene expression are minimized. Two metabolic effects of muscle phosphorylase expression were noted, inactivation of glycogen synthase, which was progressive with enzyme expression, and a decrease in glycogen synthesis, which reached a plateau at low levels of phosphorylase expression. The lack of effect of AdCMV-MGP treatment on ATP, glucose 6-P, glucokinase activity, glycolysis, or conversion of glucose to triacylglycerol indicates that at the viral titers and incubation times used, the effects of muscle phosphorylase expression are confined to glycogen metabolism. The inactivation of synthase and lack of effect on triacylglycerol metabolism contrast with findings on phosphorylase overexpression in muscle cultures (34Baqué S. Guinovart J.J. Gómez-Foix A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2594-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This may represent a tissue difference, or it may be related to the lower levels of phosphorylase overexpression used in the present study.The inhibition of glycogen synthase by muscle phosphorylase overexpression is of interest because it was not associated with either a change in glucose 6-P, an activator of synthase phosphatase (28Guinovart J.J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Seoane J. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaro S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), or an increase in phosphorylase a, a potent allosteric inhibitor of synthase phosphatase (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Two types of mechanism can be considered, involving either catalytic activity of phosphorylase or an effect of the protein independent of catalytic activity. Catalytic activity of muscle phosphorylase may cause dissociation of glycogen synthase from glycogen, an allosteric effector of the enzyme (35Solling H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), or from glycogenin, which is also a substrate for phosphorylase (36Cao Y. Skurat A.V. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21717-21721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or it may cause dissociation of a glycogen-targeting subunit of protein phosphatase-1 such as GL or PTG (37Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) from glycogen. Muscle phosphorylase b may bind to a glycogen-targeting unit and cause inactivation of synthase phosphatase activity either through an allosteric effect (29Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or by competitive binding with glycogen synthase (38Fong N.M. Jensen T.C. Shah A.S. Parekh N.N. Saltiel A.R. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35034-35039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GL has a high-affinity site for phosphorylase a as well as a substrate site, whereas PTG has a single binding site for glycogen synthase and phosphorylase (38Fong N.M. Jensen T.C. Shah A.S.

Inhibition of synthase phosphatase by phosphorylase b has been demonstrated, but with much lower affinity than that for phosphorylase a (39Alemany S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The experiments with CP-91149, which counteracted the inhibitory effects of low levels of muscle phosphorylase overexpression on glycogen synthesis and glycogen synthase, suggest that the catalytic activity of phosphorylase accounts for the inhibition of synthase by low levels of phosphorylase expression. However, an additional protein effect independent of catalytic activity at higher levels of muscle phosphorylase expression cannot be ruled out.Two points are of interest with regard to the inhibition of glycogen synthesis by phosphorylase overexpression. First, the high control coefficient is observed at both 10 and 25 mm glucose and is also observed in the presence of insulin. This contrasts with the strong glucose dependence of the control coefficient of glucokinase (12Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Aiston S. Trinh K. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24559-24566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Second, unlike the control coefficients of glucokinase or its regulatory protein (positive and negative, respectively), which are sustained over a wide range of protein overexpression (2–3-fold above endogenous activity (13Aiston S. Trinh K. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24559-24566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)), inhibition of glycogen synthesis by muscle phosphorylase reaches a plateau (50% inhibition) at low levels of phosphorylase overexpression (<30% above endogenous activity), with no further inhibition at higher protein expression. If the inhibition of [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen were due to increased degradation of glycogen rather than inhibition of synthesis, then a progressive or a linear response as a function of phosphorylase activity would be expected, as is observed for inactivation of synthase. A more plausible explanation for the sharp inhibition of glycogen synthesis that reaches a plateau at fairly low activities of phosphorylase is that it represents inhibition of synthesis and that there are two compartments of glycogen synthesis, only one of which is sensitive to inhibition by phosphorylase.The lack of correlation between the rate of glycogen synthesis and the activity of glycogen synthase at high phosphorylase overexpression could be explained by compartmentation of glycogen synthase (40Fernandez-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaro S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rate of glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes may depend on the fraction of glycogen synthase that is associated with glycogen or the protein primer, glycogenin. An increase in phosphorylase activity may cause dissociation of synthase from glycogenin, which is a substrate for phosphorylase (36Cao Y. Skurat A.V. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21717-21721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy with the high flux control coefficient of glucokinase on glycogen synthesis, which is explained by the subcellular compartmentation of glucokinase (12Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the high flux control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis could be due in part to an effect of phosphorylase catalytic activity on the subcellular compartmentation of glycogen synthase. This hypothesis is consistent with both the higher flux control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis relative to the control coefficient on glycogen synthase and the effect of glucokinase overexpression, which lowers the flux control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis but not on synthase. Overexpression of glucokinase increases the hepatocyte glucose 6-P content (27Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and glucose 6-P affects the translocation of glycogen synthase (41Fernandez-Novell J.M. Arino J. Vilaro S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A difference in subcellular compartmentation of glycogen synthase in cells overexpressing glucokinase could therefore explain the lower control coefficient and could also explain the lower fractional inhibition of glycogen synthesis by phosphorylase overexpression in cells with elevated glucokinase activity.One of the advantages of metabolic control analysis is that by providing a quantitative estimate for the degree of control exerted by an enzyme, it enables the study of how this control changes in different physiological or pathological states (8Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This study shows that glucokinase overexpression by 60% above endogenous activity lowers the control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis by 50%. This implies that for a small activation of phosphorylase (below that causing saturation of the response), a smaller inhibition of glycogen synthesis would occur in cells with a higher ratio of glucokinase to its regulatory protein. This is of interest from a physiological perspective because the ratio of glucokinase to its regulatory protein decreases during fasting and increases on refeeding (42Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be inferred that the flux control coefficient of phosphorylase on glycogen synthesis would be greatest at low ratios of glucokinase to regulatory protein, such as those that occur in the fasted to fed transition.Several inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase described recently (5Martin W.H.

As the post-genomic era moves into high gear, new “high throughput” technologies are allowing characterization of gene expression profiles, comparisons of genomic complements, and identification of the genetic markers associated with normal, pathological, or environmentally triggered states. Yet information derived from full analysis of genomics alone is clearly inadequate to explain the complexities of cell biology. Recent studies showing differences between the genome and the proteome suggest that the profound understanding we seek will require the complete and direct characterization of the proteome as well (2Gygi S.P.

This methodology involves electrophoretic separation of proteins at sub-picomole levels, digestion with trypsin, and measurement of the molecular weights of the resulting peptide mixture by mass spectrometry. This strategy can routinely identify proteins whose actual sequences are present in protein, gene, or EST data bases (13Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 217-235Google Scholar). In addition, one would also like to find related proteins even when the actual protein sequence is absent from the data bases. Here, the identity of the protein of interest can frequently be inferred if the similarities to homologs in available data bases are sufficiently high. Such identification by inference cannot be achieved solely by mass mapping, however, because patterns of tryptic digestion are generally not conserved; hence, only nearly identical homologs are likely to be found. Thus, additional experimental information, viz. amino acid sequence, is required to identify proteins whose sequences are not present in the data bases per se or that may differ even slightly from related sequences. Over the last 5 years, the primary source of sequence information obtained directly from protein has been generated using methods of tandem mass spectrometry, based upon collision-induced dissociation of tryptic fragments in protein digests. During this time, mass spectrometry has emerged as the only technology sufficiently sensitive, rapid, and robust to provide this information on a proteome-wide scale. New instrumentation is currently being developed to accommodate the high throughputs required (19Medzihradszky K.F. Campbell J.M. Baldwin M.A. Falick A.M. Juhasz P. Vestal M.L. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Sequence information, which is much better conserved among related proteins than are tryptic digestion patterns, can then be used for identification of proteins with close or sometimes even remote homologs in the data bases. Searching tools currently in use with such partial sequence data include simple string searches (20Baker, P., and Clauser, K. Protein Prospector, Version 3.4, University of California, San Francisco, on the internet at prospector.ucsf.edu.Google Scholar) and algorithms such as BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar), Gapped BLAST (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), and FASTA (23Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). When closely related homologs exist in the data bases or when the available sequence fragments represent highly conserved regions of a homolog, these approaches can be quite successful. However, when only more remote homologs are present or when homologs exist only as partial sequences, as in EST data bases, sequence information from mass spectrometric methods may be insufficient to identify the protein of interest due to two major problems. First, the statistical significance of matches in data base searches is length-dependent (24Altschul S.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), whereas segments of sequence obtained by mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides are generally short, often 10 amino acids or less. As a consequence, searching algorithms often fail to find homologs at statistically significant scores. Second, the location and coverage of peptides relative to the parent protein is highly variable and may represent regions of low or no similarity to a homolog in the data base. Thus, a score of poor statistical significance could signify an absence of homologs in the data base or that the particular peptides sequenced may represent poorly conserved regions of even fairly close homologs. The inability to distinguish between these two possibilities could result in misleading interpretation of the novelty of the sequence of interest. In a high throughput experiment, the consequences could also be substantial, resulting in a decision to divert resources elsewhere or to over-commit resources toward further analysis of the protein or protein system in question. Here we describe new strategies for more effective identification of both close and remote homologs from partial sequence information using the identification and preliminary structural analysis of the 20 S proteasome from Trypanosoma brucei (25Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as an example. Proteasomes are multicatalytic proteolytic complexes found in the cells of most organisms and play important roles in protein turnover in both cytosol and nucleus. These roles include the removal of abnormal, misfolded, or improperly assembled proteins associated with a wide range of biological functions in stress response, cell differentiation, metabolic adaptation, and cellular immune responses (26Monaco J.J. Nandi D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 729-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The proteasome provides a good model system for this study because it is a macromolecular assemblage whose component subunits cannot be directly inferred from genomic information alone, thus requiring direct characterization of its protein components. Furthermore, its relative complexity provides an appropriate challenge for initial development of high throughput strategies for characterization of an important protein machine (28Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). A combination of modern mass spectrometric techniques and newly developed informatics approaches was used to identify and characterize subunits of the proteasome. This is the first time that such a complex system has been investigated in this manner and offers evidence for the value of the approach. Further development of these informatics strategies could extend substantially the usefulness of mass spectrometric sequence information for identifying proteins in species whose genomes have not been sequenced. Preparation and electrophoretic separation of 20 S proteasomes from T. brucei was performed as described previously (25Hua S. To W.Y. Nguyen T.T. Wong M.L. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,29Huang L. Shen M. Chernushevich I. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. Robertson C.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After silver staining, protein Spots were excised from the gel. Minced gel pieces were washed with 25 mmNH4HCO3 in 50% ACN, dried in a Speedvac, and then rehydrated in 25 mm NH4HCO3solution containing trypsin. After overnight digestion at 37 °C, peptides were extracted, once with HPLC grade water and then 3 times with 50% ACN, 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The combined supernatants were dried by Speedvac and then redissolved in 50% ACN, 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots were analyzed directly without separation. The remainder was separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac microbore C18 column (1.0 mm × 15 cm), fractions from which were collected and concentrated. Molecular masses of tryptic peptides were determined by analyzing 1/20th of each unseparated digest and 1/10th of each HPLC fraction by MALDI-TOF MS (Voyager DESTR, Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Peptides were cocrystallized with equal volumes of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% ACN, 1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI spectra were internally calibrated (<20 ppm) using trypsin autolysis products. Peptide masses were submitted for data base searching using the MS-Fit program (12Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 14Jiménez C.R. Huang L. Qiu Y. Burlingame A.L. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Chemistry. John Wiley and Sons, New York1998: 16.3-16.7Google Scholar). Selected peptides were subjected to PSD analysis for partial sequence determination. High resolution-high sensitivity CID tandem MS was performed on a prototype QqoaTOF mass spectrometer (Sciex, Toronto, Canada) (30Shevchenko A. Chernushevich I. Ens W. Standing K.G. Thomson B. Wilm M. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark), using 2–3 µl of each HPLC fraction. A conventional mass spectrum was first obtained to identify peptide masses by multiple charging, and then CID spectra were collected. Mass resolution of ∼10,000 allowed unambiguous charge state determination for ions at least up to m/z 5000. Mass accuracy was typically 20 ppm or better with external calibration and was usually sufficient to distinguish between glutamine and lysine, phenylalanine and oxidized methionine, and between several combinations of two amino acid residues with the same nominal masses. In determining peptide sequences, all spectra were interpreted manually using known rules and established principles (31Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 455-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 32Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 284-303Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Potential ambiguities exist for isomeric Ile/Leu and isobaric Gln/Lys, and frequently in the assignments of terminal residues. Here PSD was the primary technique, in which the reflectron voltage in a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer was scanned to select fragment ions (33Spengler B. Kirsch D. Kaufmann R. Jaeger E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), supplemented by high quality tandem MS from the QqoaTOF mass spectrometer (30Shevchenko A. Chernushevich I. Ens W. Standing K.G. Thomson B. Wilm M. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). PSD data is generally inferior as the mass calibration is variable, whereas newer instruments such as the QqoaTOF give high quality tandem data with sufficiently accurate mass measurements to increase the success of data base searching (34Medzihradszky K.F. Leffler H. Baldwin M.A. Burlingame A.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to assist manual interpretation by removing the ambiguities arising from isobaric ions. The MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometer is another new alternative that has the additional advantage of high energy CID giving more comprehensive fragmentation, allowing Ile and Leu to be differentiated (19Medzihradszky K.F. Campbell J.M. Baldwin M.A. Falick A.M. Juhasz P. Vestal M.L. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 35Vestal M.L. Juhasz P. Hines W. Martin S.A.

A static data base, non-redundant Static, was generated by downloading the non-redundant National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base (as of 3/11/99) and modified by removing sequences matching 3 of our query sets that had been submitted to the data base following their identification early in this project (29Huang L. Shen M. Chernushevich I. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. Robertson C.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All searches used either the BLOSUM62MS scoring matrix, a version of BLOSUM62 (36Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar), modified to account for Ile/Leu and Gln/Lys ambiguities associated with determination of protein sequences using mass spectrometry (37Taylor J.A. Johnson R.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) or the PAM30MS matrix, modified in an analogous manner from the PAM30 matrix (38Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar). MS-Pattern is a program within the ProteinProspector suite (prospector.ucsf.edu/) (20Baker, P., and Clauser, K. Protein Prospector, Version 3.4, University of California, San Francisco, on the internet at prospector.ucsf.edu.Google Scholar) that searches the data bases and retrieves entries associated with a text string comprised of a keyword, accession number, or sequence. All types of BLAST searches were performed using version 2.0a19 of BLASTP as implemented by Washington University, St. Louis. Further information about this implementation is available (blast.wustl.edu/blast/README.html). Congruence analysis of Gapped BLAST (BLAST 2.0) searches was carried out for all sequence fragments from a given protein. The MultiBLAST Suite was written in Perl and Python to facilitate the generation and submission of multiple permutations and catenations of peptide sequences to Gapped BLAST, input as text files containing all sequence fragments for a single Spot. Default options for all Gapped BLAST searches were E = 1000, B = 200, and V = 200. MS-Shotgun, a modification of Shotgun (39Pegg S.C. Babbitt P.C. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was written for congruence analysis of MS data. For simple analysis, searches used individual peptide sequences as queries and then determined congruence across these searches by determining which hits were found in common by more than one peptide sequence fragment. The number of query sequences that found each hit is designated the “Shotgun Score.” For MS-Shotgun with catenation analysis, files containing the total number of peptide sequences from a single Spot (n) were generated, permuted, and catenated to give all possible sequence orders. Gapped BLAST searched each of then! catenations, and then congruence analysis was performed across all output files from either the set of single peptides or then! catenations from the peptide sequences from a given Spot. Hits were sorted either by Shotgun Score or by p values. During preparation of this manuscript, other approaches using congruence analysis came to our attention. These include extensions to the CIDentify program developed by Johnson and Taylor (40Johnson R.S. Taylor J.A. Chapman J. Mass Spectrometry of Proteins and Peptides. Humana, Totowa, NJ2000: 41-62Google Scholar),i.e. the CID Results Compiler, and the FASTS program, a modified version of the FASTA search engine. 3W. Pearson, unpublished information (available online, fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/). For comparison with our methods, data base searches were also performed with the FASTS program. Like MS-Shotgun, FASTS exploits the advantages of using all of the available sequence information from a single Spot to enhance the sensitivity and significance of the searches. The modifications reflected in FASTS relative to the parent FASTA search engine include allowing submission of multiple short sequences from one protein as a single query to the search engine and removal of the penalty for gaps between query sequences. Pairwise similarity scores for all the peptides that show matches to a given hit are included in the calculation of statistical significance. Pairwise alignments for all the hits are also reported in the FASTS output, showing which query sequences were used in the match and where they align. Because neither a description nor an evaluation of the FASTS algorithm has yet been published by its authors, we did not consider it appropriate to present extensive comparisons between our MS-Shotgun with catenation analysis and FASTS. For this reason, data from our FASTS analysis of the proteasome data are not provided in our figures or tables. To give the reader some idea of the relative performance of MS-Shotgun with catenation and FASTS on our data, important points of similarity and difference between the two approaches are provided under “Results and Discussion,” however. The parent search engine, FASTA, was also tested using all individual peptide sequences as queries to confirm that there was no absolute advantage for this study in using FASTA over BLAST. This test was performed using both the BLOSUM62MS and the PAM30MS scoring matrices. As required, functional assignments inferred from the data base search outputs were further evaluated using multiple alignments of top scoring protein hits from each MS-Shotgun with catenation search. Percent identities were calculated for these hits to identify a divergent set of sequences from available species when possible. These were aligned with the individual peptide sequences using either Pileup (41Feng D.F. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 25: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) or ClustalW (42Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). To evaluate the correctness of the linear ordering, we subsequently compared the ordering of each catenated sequence to the ordering of those same peptides within the sequences of the full-length proteasome protein subunits that were obtained independently from DNA sequencing after the completion of this study (29Huang L. Shen M. Chernushevich I. Burlingame A.L. Wang C.C. Robertson C.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 4C. C. Wang, unpublished information. While the data base search scores for these full-length sequences were useful for comparison with scores obtained for sequence fragments obtained from sequencing by mass spectrometry, these full-length sequences were not used in the bioinformatic analysis of the sequences obtained from mass spectrometry. The overall strategy used for identifying unknowns is illustrated in the flow chart in Fig. 1A. The protocols for congruence analyses using the MS-Shotgun program are illustrated graphically in Fig. 1 B. The 20 S proteasome of T. brucei separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained with silver yielded 26 protein Spots (Fig. 2), the pattern of which was highly reproducible from batch to batch although minor Spot intensities varied across different preparations. Compared with two-dimensional gel analysis of the 20 S proteasome from rat (18Huang L. Wang C.C. Burlingame A.L. Burlingame A.L. Carr S.A. Baldwin M.A. Mass Spectrometry in the Biological Sciences. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 217-235Google Scholar), the two-dimensional fingerprint showed far fewer Spots, indicating that the trypanosome proteasome is likely to be less complex. Fifteen major Spots were excised from the gel, digested overnight with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The peak list for each protein digest was searched against the calculated peptide mass values for proteins in the data bases, using the known specificity for trypsin to cleave at arginine and lysine. When this experiment was performed, no cDNA sequences of 20 S proteasome subunits from T. brucei were present in public data bases, so mass mapping was limited to searches for homologous proteins that might show conserved tryptic peptides. Not surprisingly, no proteasome entries from other species were found; therefore, after separation of digests by capillary HPLC, peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry was undertaken on all abundant peaks from each Spot (2–8 sequences were obtained per Spot). The length of sequences ranged from 5 to 18 residues, averaging ∼10 amino acids (Table I). The variability in the number and length of the sequence fragments from each Spot was typical of an analysis of this type.Table ISummary of peptide sequences determined using mass spectrometrySpot no.Peptide sequences obtained by de novosequencing1-aThe sequences obtained byde novo sequencing contain ambiguous residues represented within parentheses.

https://openalex.org/W2078199021,"The Rpd3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) functions in a large complex containing many proteins including Sin3 and Sap30. Previous evidence indicates that the pho23,rpd3, sin3, and sap30 mutants exhibit similar defects in PHO5 regulation. We report thatpho23 mutants like rpd3, sin3, andsap30 are hypersensitive to cycloheximide and heat shock and exhibit enhanced silencing of rDNA, telomeric, andHMR loci, suggesting that these genes are functionally related. Based on these observations, we explored whether Pho23 is a component of the Rpd3 HDAC complex. Our results demonstrate that Myc-Pho23 co-immunoprecipitates with HA-Rpd3 and HA-Sap30. Furthermore, similar levels of HDAC activity were detected in immunoprecipitates of HA-Pho23, HA-Rpd3, or HA-Sap30. In contrast, HDAC activity was not detected in immunoprecipitates of HA-Pho23 or HA-Sap30 from strains lacking Rpd3, suggesting that Rpd3 is the HDAC associated with these proteins. However, HDAC activity was detected in immunoprecipitates of HA-Sap30 or HA-Rpd3 from cells lacking Pho23, although levels were significantly lower than those detected in wild-type cells, indicating that Rpd3 activity is compromised in the absence of Pho23. Together, our genetic and biochemical studies provide strong evidence that Pho23 is a component of the Rpd3 HDAC complex, and is required for the normal function of this complex.

Many proteins possessing intrinsic HAT activity have been identified from various organisms, and many of these proteins have been shown to be transcriptional coactivators or have other transcription-related functions. Similarly, several HDACs have been identified in different organisms as multiprotein complexes that are associated with transcriptional repressors and co-repressors (5Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6Davie J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In many cases, HATs and HDACs are targeted to specific promoters through their interaction with DNA-binding transcription factors, suggesting that they regulate transcriptional activity by modifying the local chromatin structure at target promoters (8Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 9Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, recent reports suggest that HATs also function in an untargeted manner to acetylate histones on a genome-wide scale (11Reid J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1297-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 12Kuo M. vom, B. E. Struhl K. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1309-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Packaging of DNA into chromatin is thought to affect transcription by impeding the access of transcription factors to DNA regulatory sequences. HATs acetylate lysine residues on core histones, thereby neutralizing the positive charge of the histone tails and decreasing their affinity for DNA and/or adjacent nucleosomes in higher order chromosomal structures (7Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13Hong L. Schroth G.P. Matthews H.R. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 305-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a modification of chromatin is thought to increase the accessibility of DNA to transcription regulatory complexes (14Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 15Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R., C Allis C.D. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus, in general, hyperacetylation of histones correlates with activation of gene expression, whereas deacetylation represses transcription (16Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 17Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, the targeted recruitment of the Gcn5 HAT to specific promoters correlates with both transcriptional activation and acetylation of core histones in the vicinity of the promoters, and the HAT activity of Gcn5 is required for transcriptional activation of such target genes (8Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar,12Kuo M. vom, B. E. Struhl K. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1309-1320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Also consistent with this model, targeted recruitment of the Rpd3 HDAC complex to specific promoters correlates with both decreased acetylation and transcriptional repression, and Rpd3 catalytic activity is important for transcriptional repression (9Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 10Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M.

However, in contradiction to this model, transcriptional silencing of centromeric heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster and the yeast mating-type loci require acetylation of histone H4 (19Turner B.M.

Reuter G. Struhl K. Spierer P. Nature. 1996; 384: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Genetics. 1999; 152: 921-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that Rpd3 functions to counteract rather than to establish or maintain silencing. One possible explanation for how acetylation is required for both activation and silencing of genes is that the acetylated states of different regions of chromatin may provide distinct recognition signals for transcriptional activator and repressor protein complexes (25Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 921-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6578) Google Scholar). Loss of Rpd3 may also indirectly enhance silencing of telomeric genes sensitive to histone depletion through an increase in histone gene expression (27Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies of yeast Rpd3 and the human homologs HDAC1 and HDAC2 first established the role of HDACs in gene regulation. Rpd3 is the catalytic component of a large multiprotein complex that contains Sin3, Sap30, Sds3, and many other proteins (22Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M.

Similarly, in yeast, the Rpd3 complex is required for transcriptional repression by Ume6, a zinc finger protein that binds URS1 elements and regulates genes involved in meiosis and arginine catabolism (29Kadosh D.

Proteins were isolated from yeast cultures grown in synthetic media to anA600 of ∼1.0. Cells from 150 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation, washed once with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100), and resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μmbenzamidine HCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell suspensions were aliquoted into two tubes with 1.5 g of glass beads (425–600 nm, Sigma) and shaken for 5 min in a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec Products) at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 2500 rpm and 2 × 5 min at 10,000 rpm. Protein concentrations (typically 10–15 mg/ml) were determined at this point using a Bio-Rad Protein assay. 2 mg of protein was used in 1-ml immunoprecipitation reactions in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Immunoprecipitation reactions were precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 20 min. After removal of the beads, 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked to 12CA5 (anti-HA) was added, and reactions were incubated overnight. Beads were collected by a 1-min centrifugation at 2,200 rpm and washed 5–10 × with 1 ml of lysis buffer. For some experiments, one-third of the beads were removed at this point for HDAC assays. For Western analyses, 20 μl of protein sample buffer was added to the beads, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (1.5 h, 100 V), blocked for 1–12 h in 5% milk in TBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and incubated 1 h with primary antibody (1:2000 12CA5, 1:30 9E10) in TBS + 0.05% Tween 20. After washing, tagged proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HDAC assays were performed as described previously (58Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Kolle D. Brosch G.

The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μl of Quench solution (259 μl of HCl, 28 μl of acetic acid, 2713 μl of H2O) and 600 μl of ethyl acetate. Samples were vortexed and spun for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and 200 μl of the organic phase was counted to detect the released [3H]acetate. [3H]Acetyllysine-labeled histones were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (60Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol.

Cells were chilled on ice, washed three times in 10 ml of PBS plus 10 mm sodium butyrate, and then lysed in 8 ml of NIB (1% Nonidet P-40 in IB buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mmCaCl2, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)). Nuclei were harvested, washed twice in 8 ml of NIB, washed once in NIB with 100 mmNaCl, and washed once in 8 ml of IB with 100 mm NaCl. Nuclei were high salt-extracted twice in 8 ml of IB with 400 mm NaCl followed by centrifugation, and the nuclear pellet was extracted twice in 10 volumes of 0.2 mH2SO4 for 90 min on ice and centrifuged (30,000 × g, 25 min). Pooled supernatants were dialyzed extensively against 100 mm acetic acid at 4 °C, and the extracted histones were lyophilized and resuspended in H2O (4 mg/ml). 4 ml of histones were dialyzed against PBS; 1 ml of Quench solution and 12 ml of ethyl acetate were added; and the aqueous phase was recovered and dialyzed against 0.5× PBS, yielding prequenched [3H]acetyllysine-labeled histones (1.1 mg/ml, 2 × 106 cpm/mg).

The role of the nucleus in regulating the turnover of these proteins is not well defined, although many components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system are localized in the nucleus. We have used nucleoplasm from highly purified HeLa nuclei to examine the degradation of a physiological substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (MyoD). In vitro studies using inhibitors of the system demonstrate MyoD is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in HeLa nucleoplasm. Purified nucleoplasm in vitro also supports the generation of high molecular mass MyoD-ubiquitin adducts.

The pathway targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome via covalent tagging of the substrate protein with a polyubiquitin chain. This is accomplished in three sequential steps. Ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid protein, is initially activated by E1,1 the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), which generally shuttles ubiquitin to a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The E3 is bound to the targeted substrate and catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate. Once the first ubiquitin molecule is transferred to the substrate, a polyubiquitin chain is generated via a series of isopeptide linkages between a lysine residue of the attached ubiquitin and the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the next ubiquitin molecule to be added. The multi-ubiquitinated substrate protein is then degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent reaction (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). This highly selective proteolytic system is essential to the regulation of a wide range of nuclear proteins including cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, tumor suppressors, and oncoproteins (2Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Tansey W.P. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 773-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Laney J.D.

All of the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system are found in the cytoplasm, but the role of the nucleus in the degradation of nuclear proteins is not well understood although many of the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can also be found within the nucleus. Among these components, ubiquitin is found in the nucleus (5Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Brandt R.A. Geuze H.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The 117-kDa isoform of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1a) is found in the nucleus in a cell cycle-dependent manner (6Trausch J.S. Grenfell S.J. Handley-Gearhart P.M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L.

A functional nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system may provide additional levels of regulation of intracellular proteolysis via the cellular targeting of a substrate as well as via compartment-specific activities of its components.

These results, which couple nuclear export with degradation of the substrate, suggest that export to the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome machinery may represent a common route for the degradation of nuclear substrates. However, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of nuclear substrates in the cytoplasm envisions no role for the proteasome or the ubiquitin activating and conjugating enzymes that are localized to the nucleus. This raises questions about the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome components found in the nucleus and whether the nucleus will support ubiquitin-dependent degradation. To determine if the nucleus and its complement of components are sufficient to support ubiquitin-dependent degradation, we have developed a cell-free system based on highly purified HeLa nucleoplasm. We have evaluated both model substrates and MyoD as a physiological substrate using this system. In addition, we have extended these studies in vivo and taken advantage of the nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B (26Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). MyoD is a nuclear basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is pivotal in skeletal muscle differentiation (27Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A. Nature. 1991; 251: 761-766Google Scholar). In addition, MyoD can act as a cell cycle inhibitor during G1 (28Crescenzi M. Fleming T.P. Lassar A.B.

Nature. 1990; 345: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although the cellular locus for the degradation of MyoD has not been established, in vivo (10Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and in vitro (30Abu-Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilary S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), studies including those using proteasomal inhibitors have shown that MyoD is a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The present results now demonstrate that highly purified nucleoplasm will degrade MyoD in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner and thatin vivo, nuclear export is not required for the degradation of MyoD, indicating that MyoD is degraded by a nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber and were harvested at 50–75% confluence. For large scale culture, HeLa cells were maintained in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum and were harvested at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. Large scale cultures were obtained from the Tissue Culture Support Center at the Washington University School of Medicine. Transient transfections with MyoD were performed using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was prepared as described previously (32Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Nucleoplasm was obtained from HeLa cells via a procedure that is a modification of those of Dignamet al. (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and Blobel and Potter (34Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The preparation was monitored microscopically at each step. The HeLa cell pellet was rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). The pellet resuspended in the hypotonic buffer was then homogenized for two or three strokes with a “B” type Dounce pestle to ensure a single cell suspension. Thereafter the cells were swollen via a 45-min incubation on ice. All buffer volumes were 25 ml/g pellet (25 ml/liter suspension culture). The swollen cells were then dounced for 35 stokes with an “A” type pestle, and the resulting crude nuclei were pelleted at 600 × g for 10 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose in hypotonic buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Thereafter, 2.3 m sucrose in hypotonic buffer was added to yield a 1.62 m sucrose solution. The nuclei suspension was layered over a step gradient of 1.80 m and 2.30 m sucrose and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 1 h in a SW 28 rotor (Beckman). The pellet of nuclei was resuspended in hypotonic buffer and rinsed once by centrifugation in the same buffer. The washed nuclei were then incubated in the hypotonic buffer without MgCl2 on ice for 15 min. Following sonication, the resulting nucleoplasm was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C and stored at −70 °C after rapid freezing in liquid N2. When MyoD was used as the substrate, the sonicated nuclei were incubated with 2.5 units of DNase I/mg of protein at room temperature for 20 min before the final centrifugation step. This step was necessary for removal of DNA, which is inhibitory in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MyoD (data not shown). Control experiments showed no effect on substrate degradation when DNase I was added to reticulocyte lysate. A typical preparation of nucleoplasm (from 4 liters of HeLa cell suspension culture) contained 4–6 mg/ml protein in a total volume of 1–1.5 ml. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Nuclei were evaluated for cytoplasmic protein contamination using both morphological and biochemical criteria. Nuclei were visualized under phase contrast at each step of the preparation and were considered substantially free of cytoplasmic remnants if the nuclear envelope appeared smooth and the nuclei did not clump. The washed nuclei were assayed for lactate dehydrogenase activity as a biochemical marker of cytoplasmic contamination (8Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total activity was determined using nuclei volume based on total number of nuclei × 0.3 pl/nuclei (36Weibel E.R. Staubli W. Gnagi H.R Hess F.A. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 68-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). HeLa homogenate was obtained from an aliquot of the disrupted HeLa cells prior to centrifugation. HeLa cytosol was the supernatant obtained from 100,000 × g centrifugation of the homogenate (8Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions were also evaluated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In addition, nuclear protein contamination of the cytoplasm was assessed by Western analysis of histones using a histone pan antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 25 mg/ml, catalog no. 1 492 519). Wild-type MyoD was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pT7–7 as described previously (31Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli cells were used for expression of MyoD. Expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm, and the cells were harvested after a 5-h induction at 30 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm PMSF, and nucleic acids were removed by precipitation with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. MyoD was precipitated from the resulting supernatant using 0.6 m ammonium sulfate as described (37Thayer M.J. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6483-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Degradation assays were performed according to the method of Hershko et al. (38Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were carried out in a final volume of 12.5 μl and contained either crude reticulocyte lysate (3 μl, ∼550 μg of protein) or HeLa nucleoplasm (30 μg o protein) as the source of ubiquitin-proteasomal system components. The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT along with an exogenous protein substrate (MyoD, 400 ng/reaction) supplemented with either an ATP-depleting system (0.5 μg of hexokinase and 10 mm2-deoxyglucose) or ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.5 μg of phosphocreatine kinase). The ATP-regenerating system maintains the ATP level at ∼1 mm. Degradation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and were terminated by boiling after the addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The reaction products were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. The immunoblots were incubated with a monoclonal anti-MyoD antibody (1:250 dilution, Novacastra, NCLMyoD1) and, after incubation with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Statistical analysis of the Western blot data was performed by Student's t test after the data was quantified using Un-Scan-It gel version 5.1 software (Silk Scientific, Inc.). For the inhibition studies, MG132 (N-carbobenzoxyl-Leu-Leu-Leucinal) (Peptide Institute, Inc.) was diluted to 10 mm in Me2SO and was added to the reactions containing the ATP-regenerating system at 20 μm. A reaction containing an equal volume of the solvent Me2SO was run as a control. Methylated ubiquitin was prepared as described previously (40Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Methylated ubiquitin and the ubiquitin K48R mutant (Boston Biochem) were each prepared as a 25 mg/ml stock in H2O and were added to the degradation reaction containing the ATP-regenerating system at 5, 10, or 15 μg/12.5 μl of reaction volume. ATPγS (Sigma) was prepared as a 0.1 mstock in 10 mm Tris-Cl, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. The MyoD cDNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using a transcription-translation coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Prior to its addition to the conjugation assay, the labeled substrate-containing mixture was treated with 9 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature to inactivate components of the ubiquitin system. The NEM was neutralized with excess (9 mm) NEM. Conjugation assays were performed in a reconstituted cell-free system as described (31Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 12.5 μl: 40 μg of nucleoplasmic proteins, or 40 μg of BSA as indicated, 5 μg of ubiquitin, and ∼25,000 cpm of in vitro translated and NEM-treated 35S-MyoD. Reactions were performed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor ATPγS (4 mm) (41Johnston N.L. Cohen R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7514-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the isopeptidase inhibitor, ubiquitin aldehyde (0.5 μg) (42Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conjugation assays were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%). MyoD was visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics/Fuji). At 24 h following transfection, protein synthesis was inhibited by incubation with cycloheximide (final concentration of 100 μg/ml) (43Kawazoe Y. Nakai A. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) along with either MG132 (10 μm) or leptomycin B (10 nm). MG132 was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO, and leptomycin B was prepared as a 10 μm solution in ethanol. Control experiments were carried out with either Me2SO or ethanol alone. At the indicated time points, the cells were lysed in PBS with 0.5% Igepal, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm PMSF. The lysed cells were sonicated, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm × 1 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Equal volumes of the supernatant at each time point were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as previously described for the degradation assays. The relative amounts of MyoD were analyzed using Un-Scan-It gel version 5.1 software, and the half-life was determined based on three separate experiments. Pulse-chase analysis of MyoD stability was carried out in HeLa cells at 24 h after transfection. Cells were transfected with pC1neoMyoD or the pC1neo vector as a control. The cells were pretreated for 2 h with 10 nm leptomycin B (LMB) or an equal volume of ethanol for the (−) LMB condition prior to metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine (200 μCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h in media devoid of exogenous cysteine. The cells were washed and chased in media containing unlabeled cysteine with or without 10 nm LMB and harvested after 3 h. Cell lysates were prepared by resuspension of cells in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Igepal, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF) followed by sonication. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was pre-cleared overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (RepliGen). Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubation with a polyclonal anti-MyoD antibody (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz, sc-760) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. The beads were extensively washed, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Control experiments were carried out to confirm LMB's biological activity. Herein, HeLa cells growing on coverslips were transiently transfected with GFP-IκBα (44Sachdev S. Bagchi S. Zhang D.D. Mings A.C. Hannick M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated for 1 h with 10 nm LMB and localization of the GFP-IκBα fusion protein was determined by indirect immunofluorescence (45Gilmore T.D. Temin H.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 791-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with anti-GFP antibody (1:500 dilution, Chemicon, AB16901). The resulting images were photographed (magnification, ×40) using an Olympus BX 60 microscope. HeLa cells were transfected with pClneo myoD. 24 h later cells were incubated with MG132 or LMB for 3 h as described above. Thereafter, localization of MyoD was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with a polyclonal anti-MyoD antibody (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz, sc-760), and the resulting images were photographed (magnification, ×40) using an Olympus BX60 microscope. In an effort to examine the role of the nucleus in the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of short-lived nuclear proteins, we established a cell-free system that supports the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of exogenous protein substrates. This cell-free system is dependent upon highly purified nucleoplasm obtained from HeLa nuclei that were isolated by sucrose density centrifugation. The nuclei are essentially free of cytoplasmic contamination by both microscopic examination and lactate dehydrogenase analyses (Fig. 1,A and C). A typical result for the lactate dehydrogenase analysis yielded 1329 units/min of activity for the cytoplasm and 0.17 units/min of activity for the nuclei, for a relative contamination of 0.013%. In addition, SDS-PAGE and Western analysis using histones as a marker indicate histones are the major protein species present in the nucleoplasm with essentially no contamination (undetectable by Western blot scanning) of the post-nuclear supernatant (Fig. 1 B). With this system, we first examined ATP-dependent degradation of lysozyme as a model protein substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (38Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa nucleoplasm served as the source of ubiquitin-proteasome components. All assays were also performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate in control reactions. After establishing that our cell-free system supports the ATP-dependent degradation of lysozyme (data not shown), we next determined if a physiological substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system could be degraded by the nucleoplasm. As seen in Fig. 2 B, MyoD is degraded by HeLa nucleoplasm in an ATP-dependent manner. The results from five similar experiments were quantified using Un-Scan-It gel version 5.1 software and are reported here as total pixels corrected for background pixels. The results seen in the lower portions of Fig. 2 B show the ATP-dependent degradation of MyoD in nucleoplasm. The difference between the degree of degradation for the ATP-containing and ATP-depleted reactions is significant at p < 0.001. This is also the case for MyoD degradation in the reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2 A). In addition, we observed a second immunoreactive band of slightly slower mobility in the (+) ATP reaction for the nucleoplasm (Fig.2 B). This band was consistently present in reactions with nucleoplasm, was not observed with the reticulocyte lysate, and may represent the phosphorylated form of MyoD described in Song et al. (10Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To determine if the degradation of MyoD that occurs in nucleoplasm is proteasome-dependent, we examined the effect of ATPγS and MG132. As seen in Fig. 3, MyoD is not degraded in the presence of ATPγS alone. A >5-fold molar excess of ATPγS is associated with a decrease in the ATP-dependent degradation of MyoD in nucleoplasm as well as in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 3, ATPγS). The decrease in degradation in the presence of ATPγS is consistent with proteasome-mediated degradation since the ATPase activity at the 19 S cap structure of the 26 S proteasome is the ATP-dependent step in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway requiring hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate (46Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). To confirm involvement of the proteasome in nucleoplasm-supported MyoD degradation, we examined the effect of the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132. As seen in Fig. 3, MG132 inhibited MyoD degradation in both HeLa nucleoplasm and reticulocyte lysate. These observations indicate that the nuclear proteasome is functional in the recognition and processing of a nuclear substrate. To verify that the nucleoplasm-supported degradation of MyoD is ubiquitin dependent, we examined the specificity of the ATP-dependent degradation by using inhibitors directed at the ubiquitin-substrate conjugation reactions. Proteins are tagged for recognition by the 26 S proteasome via the conjugation of a polyubiquitin chain to the (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). This polyubiquitin chain is generated by isopeptide linkages between the carboxyl terminus of each ubiquitin molecule with lysine 48 of the preceding ubiquitin. This process is competitively inhibited by methylated ubiquitin (40Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) as well as the ubiquitin K48R mutant (47Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Thus, methylated ubiquitin (MeUb) and ubiquitin K48R (Ub K48R) were added in increasing amounts to the degradation reaction in an effort to overcome the effect of endogenous ubiquitin. As seen in Fig. 4, the ATP-dependent degradation of MyoD is competitively inhibited by MeUb and by UbK48R in either HeLa nucleoplasm or reticulocyte lysate. This competitive inhibition can be overcome by the addition of excess wild-type ubiquitin in either case. These results indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is responsible for the ATP-dependent degradation of MyoD in HeLa nucleoplasm. Ubiquitin conjugation assays were performed with isolated nucleoplasm as a direct measurement of the ability of the nuclear ubiquitin system components to support conjugation (Fig. 5).35S-Labeled MyoD is found in higher molecular mass forms typical of ubiquitin conjugate ladders. The MyoD-ubiquitin conjugate ladders occur only in the presence of nuclear extract and are increased by addition of the proteasome inhibitor, ATPγS (41Johnston N.L. Cohen R.E.

https://openalex.org/W2089146368,"The gene encoding the murine calcitonin receptor (mCTR) was isolated, and the exon/intron structure was determined. Analysis of transcripts revealed novel cDNA sequences, new alternative exon splicing in the 5′-untranslated region, and three putative promoters (P1, P2, and P3). The longest transcription unit is greater than 67 kilobase pairs, and the location of introns within the coding region of the mCTR gene (exons E3–E14) are identical to those of the porcine and human CTR genes. We have identified novel cDNA sequences that form three new exons as well as others that add 512 base pairs to the 5′ side of the previously published cDNA, thereby extending exon E1 to 682 base pairs. Two of these novel exons are upstream of exon E2 and form a tripartite exon E2 (E2a, E2b, and E2c) in which E2a is utilized by promoter P2 with variable splicing of E2b. The third new exon (E3b′) lies between E3a and E3b and is utilized by promoter P3. Analysis of mCTR mRNAs has revealed that the three alternative promoters give rise to at least seven mCTR isoforms in the 5′ region of the gene and generate 5′-untranslated regions of very different lengths. Analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction shows that promoters P1 and P2 are utilized in osteoclasts, brain, and kidney, whereas promoter P3 appears to be osteoclast-specific. Using transiently transfected reporter constructs, promoter P2 has activity in both a murine kidney cell line (MDCT209) and a chicken osteoclast-like cell line (HD-11EM), whereas promoter P3 is active only in the osteoclast-like cell line.

It also has effects on the central nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems, and CTRs have been identified on osteoclasts, certain kidney cells, some regions of the brain, testis, ovary, and spermatoza (for a review, see Ref. 10Deftos L. Favos M. Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. Lipincott-Raven Press, Philadelphia1996: 82-87Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the human CTR (hCTR), when coexpressed with receptor activity-modifying proteins, is also a receptor for the 37-amino acid peptide hormone amylin (11Christopoulos G.

Neurobiol. 1997; 11: 167-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The CTR gene has a complex structural organization with several CTR protein isoforms derived from alternative splicing of transcripts from a single gene (15Goldring S. Bilezikian J. Raisz L. Rodan G. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 462-470Google Scholar). These isoforms, which are functionally distinct in terms of ligand binding specificity and/or signal transduction pathway utilization, are distributed both in a tissue-specific and species-specific pattern (16–27). Furthermore, spliced mRNA products have been identified in hCTR that generate translation terminations shortly after transmembrane domain 1 (28Moore E.E. Kuestner R.E. Stroop S.D. Grant F.J.

Beaumont K. Endocrinol. 1995; 136: 5377-5384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and porcine CTR (pCTR) (22Zolnierowicz S. Cron P. Solinas-Toldo S. Fries R. Lin H.Y. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19530-19538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genomic sequences have been cloned, little is known about the mechanism of transcriptional regulation for the CTR gene in osteoclasts or in other tissues in which it is expressed. A 657-bp fragment of the pCTR promoter was demonstrated to drive expression of a luciferase reporter gene when transfected into the CTR-expressing porcine kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 (22Zolnierowicz S. Cron P. Solinas-Toldo S. Fries R. Lin H.Y. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19530-19538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the function of a 2.1-kb fragment of the pCTR promoter has been assessed in a transgenic mouse by Jagger et al. (30Jagger C. Gallagher A. Chambers T. Pondel M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). They found that although this region directed expression of the lacZ reporter in several embryonic and fetal tissues that express endogenous mCTR, it was not sufficient to direct transcription in the adult kidney or bone of the transgenic mice. In this report, the gene encoding the murine CTR (mCTR) was isolated, and the exon/intron structure was determined. We have identified novel cDNA sequences that extend the beginning of the previously published mCTR cDNA (21Yamin M. Gorn A.H. Flannery M.R. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Tapp D.R. Krane S.M. Goldring S.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by 512 bp, thereby enlarging exon E1 to 682 bp. Further analysis of mCTR cDNAs has also revealed three new exons within the 5′-UTR, new alternative exon splicing in the 5′-UTR, and the presence of three putative promoters (P1, P2, and P3). Two of these novel exons are upstream of the original cDNA exon E2 and form a tripartite exon E2 (E2a, E2b, and E2c) in which E2a is utilized by promoter P2 with variable splicing of E2b. The third new exon (E3b′) lies between E3a and E3b and is utilized by promoter P3. Analysis of mCTR mRNAs reveals that the transcripts from the three promoters are spliced to yield seven different 5′-UTR structures. Analysis by both RT-PCR and transient transfection of promoter-luciferase reporter constructs shows that the P1 promoter (located upstream of an expanded exon E1) and the P2 promoter (located upstream of exon E2a) are utilized in osteoclasts, brain, and kidney, whereas the P3 promoter (located upstream of the novel exon E3b′) appears to be exclusively utilized in osteoclasts. The P2 promoter of mCTR is highly homologous to the promoter region previously defined for pCTR in kidney cells. These studies provide the first evidence that CTR is regulated in a tissue-specific manner by alternative promoter utilization and that there is a unique promoter (P3) that regulates CTR expression only in osteoclasts. A murine genomic library made from the 129 mouse strain in Lambda FIX II (provided by Dr. Chuxia Deng, Bethesda, MD) was screened using probes from the murine CTR cDNA clone isolated by Yamin et al.(21Yamin M. Gorn A.H. Flannery M.R. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Tapp D.R. Krane S.M. Goldring S.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with 32P by random priming. The 13 positive phage clones were plaque-purified, and DNA was prepared utilizing standard procedures. NotI fragments containing the mCTR genomic DNA from these phage were subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene) and analyzed by restriction enzyme site mapping and hybridization with region-specific CTR probes. In some cases, PCR between exons was used to determine the intron size. Note that the originally published cDNA (21Yamin M. Gorn A.H. Flannery M.R. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Tapp D.R.

Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) with Sequenase polymerase version 2 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and primers based on previously known or novel mCTR sequence as necessary. The exon/intron junctions were established by comparison of genomic sequence with the cDNA sequence. Comparison with other CTR genomic sequences was done using both BLAST (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60220) Google Scholar) and the GCG sequence analysis package (33Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from either mouse organs (brain, liver, kidney), osteoclast cocultures, or cell lines by using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Osteoclasts were generated by coculture of hematopoietic progenitors with the stromal cell line ST2 essentially as previously described (34Turner C.W. Archer D.R. Wong J. Yeager A.M. Fleming W.H. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 103: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were collected by flushing the femurs and tibiae of 5-week-old male C57/Bl6 mice with α-minimal essential medium. The cells were cultured for 24 h in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and then the nonadherent population was collected and erythrocytes were removed using a density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma). The remaining hematopoietic progenitors were cocultured with ST2 cells at a 1:10 ratio in medium containing 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−8m) and dexamethasone (10−7m). After 9 days of coculture, the ST2 stromal cells were removed by incubation with collagenase, and then the remaining osteoclasts were harvested for RNA as previously described (35Lee S.K. Goldring S.R. Lorenzo J. Endocrinol. 1995; 136: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). mRNA was prepared using the poly(A) quick mRNA isolation kit (Stratagene). RNA samples (5–20 μg) from various tissues or cell lines were reverse transcribed to generate primer extension products using the Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an mCTR-specific antisense primer located in exon E1 end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The primer extension products were separated in a 7% polyacrylamide sequencing gel together with a sequencing reaction of the mCTR genomic clone 18.26 using the same primer used in the primer extension reaction. To determine the 5′-end of exon E1, an RPA was performed. A 532-bp mCTR genomic DNA fragment spanning from a BsaBI site to a BamHI site encompassing the 5′-end region and part of exon E1 was blunted with Klenow and subcloned into the SmaI site of pBKS vector, linearized with BamHI, and used as a template for synthesizing a 635-bp riboprobe with [α-32P]CTP utilizing T3 RNA polymerase. Total RNA from mouse brain (200 μg) and mRNA from MDCT209 cells (20 μg) were used as templates for RPA using 2 × 105 cpm of the riboprobe following the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). In addition, mCTR cRNA sense strand derived from the same RPA construct was used as a positive control that would yield a 376-bp protected fragment. The RPA protected products were separated in a 5% sequencing gel and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). To identify and verify the sequence of the 5′-ends of mCTR transcripts, mouse brain, kidney, and osteoclast RNA samples were used to generate adapter-ligated double-stranded cDNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). For each PCR reaction, 2 μl of the double-stranded cDNA adapter ligation solution diluted to 1:10 was added into a total volume of 50 μl of PCR buffer solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm each of the 5′ and 3′ primers, 2 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher). Several 5′-RACE experiments were performed using different primer sets with two rounds of PCR. The first round PCR was performed using the sense adapter primer AP1 and two different mCTR antisense primers, either mPE1 or E6-R (see Table I). The AP1 + mPE1 PCR products were used for a second nested round of PCR using the sense adapter primer AP2 and the mCTR primer mPE3. The AP1 + E6-R PCR products were used for several nested PCRs using sense primer AP2 and either mCTR antisense primer E4-R, E5-R, or E6-R. The PCR conditions for both PCR rounds were 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 15 s for 30 cycles using the Gene Amp PCR system 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Southern blot analysis was performed using [γ-32P]ATP-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes located internal to the expected PCR products for each experiment, such as mPE4 and E3b-R. The mCTR positive 5′-RACE products were subcloned into the TA 2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNAs were characterized by sequencing from both orientations using T7 and M13-reverse primers.Table IPrimersNameLocation (F/R) 1-aR, reverse; F, forward.Length5′ → 3′ sequenceE1-FmCTR E1 (F)22AGCCCGTCCTTGGAAGCAACTTmPE1mCTR E1 (R)26AGGCGGGCGCAGTCTGGGCTGGCAGGmPE3mCTR E1 (R)22GCAAGTTGCTTCCAAGGACGGGmPE4mCTR E1 (R)42GCAAGTTGCTTCCAAGGACGGGCTATCCTCCACCTCCTATCCmPE6mCTR E1 (R)30GAGGTTGAGTTTGGGTAGTTCTGGGTGACAE2a-F1mCTR E2a (F)12GGCACTGCTAAGE2a-F2mCTR E2a (F)18GCGGCAGGCACTGCTAAGE2b-RmCTR E2b (R)31AATAGGCTCCAGGCAAGGTCCTTTTCCCGGTE2c-FmCTR E2c (F)23CTTCTGCGCCTCACGCTGCCGTTE2c-RmCTR E2c (R)21CTGGGCACAGCTCAGGTGTTCE3a-FmCTR E3a (F)23CATCCACCTAAGGTAAGTGCCATE3a-RmCTR E3a (R)21TAGCCCTGCTCCCTCGGTTTCE3b′-FmCTR E3b′ (F)24CCCTGAAGCCCAAAGGAAACTGTGE3b′-RmCTR E3b′ (R)25AGACTGAATAGCCTGAATGCACTCGE3b-RmCTR E3b (R)23GGAGCAGGAGCAGCAGGGTGAACE4-RmCTR E4 (R)24CGGAGTCAGTGAGATTGGTAGGAGE5-RmCTR E5 (R)21CAAAGTCCGGGAAGTAGTCAGE6-RmCTR E6 (R)20GGTCGGTTGCTGTCAGGGTGmTM5-FmCTR E11/12 (F)24GTCATGGTGGCTCTGGTGGTCAACmTM7-RmCTR E13 (R)24GCAGAAGCAGTAGATAGTCGCCACAP1Adapter primer 127CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAP2Adapter primer 223ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCGAPDH-SGAPDH24TTCGACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCTTGAPDH-ASGAPDH23CAGGCGCCCAATACGACCAAATC1-a R, reverse; F, forward. Open table in a new tab For reverse transcription reactions, 2 μg of total RNA samples from mouse liver, brain, kidney, and osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cocultures were used to generate cDNAs with 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) using the reverse transcription Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Different sets of mCTR-specific primer pairs were used to analyze the variable structure of the mCTR mRNAs, and a pair of primers specific for GAPDH was used to assess the quality of the RNA samples. Additionally, a pair of primers (mTM5-F and mTM7-R) from a mCTR region without variable splicing was used to establish the presence or absence of mCTR mRNA in each sample. For all PCRs except GAPDH and plasmid controls, equal amounts of each cDNA (2 μl of a 30-μl RT reaction) were added to a total volume of 50 μl of PCR solution similar to that previously described in the 5′-RACE method. For the GAPDH PCR, only 1 μl of the RT reaction was added to the PCR. PCR of relevant mCTR cDNA plasmids (1 ng) generated by the 5′-RACE (P1.1, P2.1, P2.3, and P3.1) were used to prepare control PCR products. Also, for all PCR reactions, a negative control containing H2O instead of cDNA was run. The PCR conditions for the 110-bp GAPDH PCR product were 95 °C for 2 min and then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s, ending with 72 °C for 7 min. To analyze the mCTR mRNA splice isoforms generated from the P1, P2, and P3 transcripts, either sense primer E1-F, E2a-F, or E3b′-F was used, respectively, together with antisense primer E4-R. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 35 cycles, except for E2a-F2 + E4-R, for which 50 °C was used instead of 60 °C. Southern blot analysis was performed sequentially or on parallel blots with [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotide probes E2a-F2, E2b-R, E2c-F, E3a-R, E3b′-F, and E3b-R. To test the putative P2 and P3 mCTR promoter activities, the blunt-ended mCTR DNA genomic fragments containing appropriate P2 and P3 regions were subcloned in both orientations into theSmaI site of the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega), which does not contain a promoter or an enhancer. The initial P2 genomic region used spanned from the BamHI site in E1 (−1253 relative to E2a) to the EcoRI site at the end of E2c (+398) (−1253P2Bam-F and −1253P2Bam-R). The initial 859-bp P3 genomic region (starting at −797 relative to E3b′) was synthesized by PCR using primers E3a-F and E3b′-R (−797P3ab′-F and −797P3ab′-R). The identity and orientation of each construct was verified by sequencing. In addition, three P2 deletion constructs were generated using theKpnI, SacI, and NheI sites in the 5′ polylinker region and in the P2 promoter DNA (−806P2Kpn-F, −285P2Sac-F, −179P2Nhe-F, respectively) to drop successively larger fragments after recircularizing the construct. Further P2 deletions were derived from the −179P2Nhe-F plasmid as follows. The −30P2Afl-F and the −179/−27P2NAf-F plasmids were generated by dropping the 148-bp NheI/AflII and the 453-bpAflII/HindIII fragments, respectively, blunting, and recircularizing, while the −178/+16P2NNs-F was generated by subcloning the 194-bp NheI/NspBII fragment intoSmaI-cut pGL3basic. The −797P3ab′-F construct was used to generate P3 deletions to −319 and −94 by digesting the plasmid withNheI plus XhoI, which cut in the polylinker, isolating the mCTR fragment, and redigesting it withBsrI or MslI. The BsrI/XhoI and MslI/XhoI mCTR fragments were then blunted and cloned back into the SmaI site of pGL3basic to make −319P3Bsr-F and −94P3Msl-F, respectively. The promoter activity of the various P2- and P3-pGL3basic constructs were tested in two different cell lines, a murine distal convoluted tubule cell line (MDCT209) (36Gesek F.A. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from Dr. P. Friedman, Dartmouth, Hanover, NH) and the chicken osteoclast-like cell line HD-11EM (37Hsia Y.-J. Kim J.-K. Damoulis P.D. Hauschka P.V. J. Bone Miner.

The cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% (MDCT209) or 10% (HD-11EM) fetal calf serum. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells/well (MDCT) or 1 × 106cells/well (HD-11EM) in a six-well plate were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The P2-pGL3 and P3-pGL3 plasmids (1.5–3 μg/well) were transiently transfected (in triplicate) into each cell line in serum-free medium using 5–12 μl LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated 4–5 h before an appropriate amount of serum was added, and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h. The transfected cells were harvested by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by incubation with 300 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm glycyl glycine buffer (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 4 °C. Luciferase activities were determined in luciferase buffer (25 mm glycyl glycine buffer (pH 7.8), 15 mmKPO4 (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) using an AutoLumat (EGΣG Berthold) luminometer. The results represent at least three repeats of each experiment. Luciferase activity was normalized by total protein concentration determined using Coomassie protein assay reagent from Pierce. A murine genomic library was screened using probes derived from a previously isolated mCTR cDNA clone (21Yamin M. Gorn A.H. Flannery M.R. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Tapp D.R. Krane S.M.

We obtained 13 positive phage clones (Fig.1 A) encompassing most of the transcription unit (>67 kb) with the exception of part of one very long intron (IVS3b′) that is greater than 13.9 kb. In addition, the genomic DNA corresponding to a gap between the sequences contained in phages 3 and 15 was isolated by using PCR between exons E6 and E7 employing mouse strain 129 genomic DNA as template (CD-PCRin Fig. 1 A). The identified phage clones include 15 kb of the putative 5′-flank and 8 kb of the 3′-flanking regions. Characterization of all the exon/intron junctions, determination of intron sizes, and mapping of sites for multiple restriction enzymes is shown in Fig. 1 A. Sequence analysis confirms the presence of appropriate donor-acceptor consensus sequences (GT-AG) (39Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev.

Of interest, the location of the exon/intron junctions of the coding exons in the mCTR gene are exactly the same as in the porcine and human CTR genes (22Zolnierowicz S. Cron P. Solinas-Toldo S.

This includes the two putative translation start sites (Fig. 1 A, labeled aa) that are split between two exons in the murine (E3a and E3b) and human (71-bp insert and E3) CTR genes. Use of the upstream translational start would add 17 amino acids to the mCTR protein (Fig. 1 B,shaded box at the N terminus of the protein). Exon E8b is a rodent-specific 111-bp coding exon that adds 37 amino acids to the extracellular domain 2 of mCTR and is alternatively spliced in mCTR mRNAs (18Sexton P.M. Houssami S. Hilton J.M.

In order to determine the transcription start site of the mCTR gene, primer extension and 5′-RACE analyses were performed using RNA from mouse tissues known to express CTR and in which CT exhibits biological activities (murine brain, kidney, and osteoclasts). The primer extension analysis was first carried out with a 32P-end-labeled mCTR-specific antisense primer (mPE1; see Fig.2 A) with its 3′-end located 75 nt downstream from the reported 5′-end of mCTR (21Yamin M.

https://openalex.org/W2013072710,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid with multiple physiological and pathological effects. PAF exerts its activity through a specific heptohelical G-protein coupled receptor, expressed on a variety of cell types, including leukocytes. In this study, we showed that PAF induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tyk2 kinase in the monocytic cell lines U937 and MonoMac-1. PAF-initiated Tyk2 phosphorylation was also observed in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the human PAF receptor (PAFR) and Tyk2 cDNAs. In addition, we found that Tyk2 co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized with PAFR, independently of ligand binding. Deletion mutants of Tyk2 indicated that the N terminus of the kinase was important for the binding to PAFR. Activation of Tyk2 was followed by a time-dependent 2–4-fold increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT2, and STAT3 and a sustained 2.5-fold increase in STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. In MonoMac-1 cells, STAT1 and STAT3 translocated to the nucleus following PAF stimulation, and their translocation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells was shown to be dependent on the presence of Tyk2. In addition, when COS-7 cells were transfected with PAFR and constructs containing PAFR promoter 1, coupled to the luciferase reporter gene, PAF induced a 3.6-fold increase in promoter activation in the presence of Tyk2. Finally, PAFR mutants that could not couple to G-proteins were found to effectively mediate Tyk2 activation and signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest an important role for the Janus kinase/STAT pathway in PAFR signaling, independent of G-proteins, and in the regulation of PAF receptor expression by its ligand. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid with multiple physiological and pathological effects. PAF exerts its activity through a specific heptohelical G-protein coupled receptor, expressed on a variety of cell types, including leukocytes. In this study, we showed that PAF induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the Tyk2 kinase in the monocytic cell lines U937 and MonoMac-1. PAF-initiated Tyk2 phosphorylation was also observed in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the human PAF receptor (PAFR) and Tyk2 cDNAs. In addition, we found that Tyk2 co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized with PAFR, independently of ligand binding. Deletion mutants of Tyk2 indicated that the N terminus of the kinase was important for the binding to PAFR. Activation of Tyk2 was followed by a time-dependent 2–4-fold increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT2, and STAT3 and a sustained 2.5-fold increase in STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. In MonoMac-1 cells, STAT1 and STAT3 translocated to the nucleus following PAF stimulation, and their translocation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells was shown to be dependent on the presence of Tyk2. In addition, when COS-7 cells were transfected with PAFR and constructs containing PAFR promoter 1, coupled to the luciferase reporter gene, PAF induced a 3.6-fold increase in promoter activation in the presence of Tyk2. Finally, PAFR mutants that could not couple to G-proteins were found to effectively mediate Tyk2 activation and signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest an important role for the Janus kinase/STAT pathway in PAFR signaling, independent of G-proteins, and in the regulation of PAF receptor expression by its ligand. GTP-binding regulatory protein G-protein-coupled receptor Janus kinase pertussis toxin platelet-activating factor platelet-activating factor receptor signal transducers and activators of transcription antibody base pair(s) phospholipid interleukin tumor necrosis factor Platelet-activating factor (PAF)1 is a potent phospholipid mediator involved in a variety of biological processes. PAF plays a role in allergic disorders and inflammation, and it has also been implicated in reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, and immune systems. PAF is produced by many cells, including monocytes, endothelial cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Many of these cell types can themselves become targets of PAF bioactions (1Braquet P. Touqui L. Shen T.Y. Vargaftig B.B. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 97-145PubMed Google Scholar, 2Snyder F. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C697-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Venable M.E. Zimmermann G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 691-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAF mediates its effects via the activation of a seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Upon binding to its receptor, PAF simulates a number of signal transduction pathways. These include phospholipid turnover, through phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and PLCβ activation, in many systems, including platelets, macrophages, B cell lines, endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells (4Izumi T. Shimuzu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 5Chao W. Olson M.S. Biochem.

PAF also activates PLA2, PLD, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in many different cells and tissues (reviewed in Ref. 4Izumi T. Shimuzu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that PAF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins, such as p125fak in human endothelial cells and brain (7Soldi R. Sanavio F. Aglietta M. Primo L. Defilippi P. Marchisio P.C. Bussolino F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar, 8Calcerrada M.C. Calatan R.E. Pérez-Alvarez M. Miguel B.G. Martinez A.M.

Monk P.N. Downes C.P. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that a protein tyrosine kinase pathway may also be implicated in PAF-induced activation of PLD, mitogen-activated protein kinase and PLA2, but the nature of the kinases involved and the molecular mechanisms through which PAF receptor activates tyrosine kinase signals are not well understood (4Izumi T. Shimuzu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The involvement of different subtypes of G-proteins has been documented for some signaling pathways. PAFR couples to both pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and PTX-insensitive G-proteins, and thus PAF-induced activation of PLC isoforms or other enzymes could vary depending on cell type. For example, in macrophages and neutrophils, phosphoinositol turnover induced by PAF is sensitive to PTX and might be attributed to G-protein Giα2 and Giα3 subunits expressed in these cells (4Izumi T. Shimuzu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,12Rezaul K. Sada K. Inazu T. Yamamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas in Chinese hamster ovary cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to PAF is mediated by Gαo (13Van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). PAF has been shown to induce the expression of early response genes such as c-fos and c-jun in many cells and tissues, as well as regulating the transcription of cytokine genes such as IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-α in human monocytes, TNF in NK cells, and IL-6 in endothelial cells and neutrophils (reviewed in Ref.14Rola-Pleszczynski M. Thivierge M. Gagnon M. Lacasse N. Stankova J. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 175-181PubMed Google Scholar). PAF also up-regulates the expression of its own receptor in several cell types (15Mutoh H. Ishii S. Izumi T. Kato S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), including human alveolar macrophages (16Shimizu T. Mutoh H. Kato S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 416: 79-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rat epithelial cells (17Wang H. Tan X. Chang H. Huang W. Gonzalez-Crussi F. Hsueh W. Immunology. 1999; 97: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), thus potentially providing a positive feedback loop for PAF action. Two distinct promoters are involved in the transcriptional regulation of PAFR gene expression in various cell types, resulting in two transcripts, 1 and 2, which differ only in their untranslated region. The human PAFR transcript 1 is ubiquitous but is most abundant in peripheral leukocytes and may be chiefly regulated by inflammatory and various pathological processes (18Mutoh H. Bito H. Minami M. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Nakata R. Kurachi Y. Terano A. Shimizu T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The human PAFR transcript 2 is found in the heart, lung, spleen, and kidney and can be regulated by retinoic acid, thyroid hormone T3, estrogen, and transforming growth factor-β, among others (19Mutoh H. Kume K. Sato S. Kato S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Mutoh H. Fukuda T. Katamaoto T. Masushige S. Sasaki H. Shimizu T. Kato S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We and others have also shown PAFR gene expression to be modulated by interferon-γ, transforming growth factor-β, cAMP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and TNF-α at a transcriptional level (21Ouelet S. Muller E. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5092-5099PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dagenais P. Thivierge M. Parent J.-L. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The nature of the transcription factors involved in PAF-induced human PAFR gene expression has yet to be identified. It has been shown that PAF can induce NF-κB activation and receptor transcription through three NF-κB consensus sites in promoter 1 upstream of –459 bp in certain cell types (19Mutoh H. Kume K. Sato S. Kato S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Kravcenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J.-M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14928-14934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway is one of the major mechanisms by which cytokine receptors transduce intracellular signals. To date, four mammalian Jaks have been identified (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2), and seven STATs have been characterized (27Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Liu K., D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). One central feature of the Jak/STAT cascade is its rapid activation. Both Jaks and STATs become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues within 1–15 min of receptor stimulation, followed by a STAT homo- or heterodimerization, nuclear translocation, and finally transcriptional activation of specific genes (27Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Liu K., D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that Jaks may also play an essential role in GPCR signaling. Ligand-specific stimulation of the chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR4 triggers tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Jak2/STAT3 pathway (29Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M.

Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) found that in rat aortic smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II also leads to the rapid activation of the Jak/STAT pathway. In the present report, we show that PAF-mediated PAFR transcription is dependent on the activation of the Jak/STAT pathway. The Tyk2 kinase is activated in response to PAF in myeloid cells and in a transfected cell system. This activation leads to subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1, 2, 3, and 5. Tyk2 associates with PAFR, independently of agonist binding, and its presence is obligatory for human PAFR promoter 1 activation. Finally, Tyk2 activation by PAF is independent of G-protein coupling. PAF was from the Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). WEB 2086, a PAF-specific antagonist was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-Tyk2 and anti-STATs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal anti-N-terminal region of Tyk2 (Transduction Laboratories, Missisavga, Canada); monoclonal anti-HA (anti-hemagglutinin; BAbCO, Richmond, CA), monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) was a kind gift from Drs.

Nonpertinent control antibodies OKT3 and polyclonal anti-LTB4 receptor were from ATCC and Cayman Chemical Co., respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human Tyk2 wild type and mutant cDNAs were generated as described (33Yan H. Piazza F. Krishnan K. Pine R. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4046-4051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The human PAFR cDNA was a gift form Dr. R. Ye (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Murine STAT1α and STAT3 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. J. E. Darnell (Rockefeller University, New York, NY) and Dr. S. Akira (Hyogo College of Medicine, Japan), respectively. MonoMac-1 (DSM ACC252) and U937 (ATCC CRL-1593.2) were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) and the ATCC, respectively. COS-7 were kindly provided by Dr. G. Guillemette (Université de Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada). FuGENETM6 transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. pJ3M expression vector was a gift from Dr. J. Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center) COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (1 × 106cells/dish) and transiently transfected with human PAFR cDNA cloned into the pJ3M expression vector with or without hTyk2 or pcDNA3 cDNA (4–7 μg of DNA, total) using 8–14 μl of FuGENE. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated without serum for 1 h and then stimulated with PAF (10−7m) or left unstimulated. Cells were lysed, and extracts used as indicated below for immunoprecipitation. U937 were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml ampicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In the case of MonoMac-1 cells, 10 mmnonessential amino acids and 10 mm sodium pyruvate were added. U937 or MonoMac-1 cells (20 × 106) were incubated in medium without fetal bovine serum 24 h, stimulated with PAF (10−8m) for the indicated times, and lysed in buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 30 min on ice. Lysates were precleared with 25 μg of protein A-Sepharose for 30 min and incubated with anti-Tyk2 or anti-STAT Abs overnight at 4 °C. Proteins of interest were precipitated by incubation with 100 μg of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. In case of immunoprecipitation of PAFR with c-Myc Ab, protein A-Sepharose was gently shaken in lysis buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature before use. After washing four times in 0.5× lysis buffer, complexes were dissolved in 1× loading buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 2.5% gelatin for 1 h and incubated with anti-Tyr(P) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 0.1% + 0.5% gelatin overnight at 4 °C. After washing and incubation with secondary antibodies, an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system was used for protein detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C. After washing, membranes were reprobed with appropriate Ab and developed as described above. To confirm receptor specificity, cells were pretreated with WEB 2086 (10−5–10−7m) for 20 min at 37 °C before PAF stimulation. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells (1–1.6 μg of cDNA, 2 × 105 cells) were plated on 25-mm coverslips and processed as previously described (16Shimizu T. Mutoh H. Kato S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 416: 79-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications. For the analysis of PAFR and Tyk2 colocalization, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and permeabilized in 0.1% saponin (Sigma). During all subsequent washing procedures, 0.01% saponin was added. For STAT translocation experiments, MonoMac-1 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and preincubated 1 h with sodium orthovanadate (60 μm, Sigma) before PAF stimulation. In these experiments, 0.1% Triton was used for cellular permeabilization. The cells were incubated with anti-c-Myc or isotype control OKT3 or nonpertinent anti-BLTR Abs. Cells were examined with a scanning confocal microscope (NORAN Instruments Inc., Middleton, WI) equipped with a krypton/argon laser and coupled to an inverted microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective (Nikon). Specimens were excited at 488 and 568 nm. Emitted fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence and rhodamine fluorescence were measured at wavelengths 525–550 and 590 nm, respectively. Optical sections were collected at 1-μm intervals with a 10-μm pinhole aperture. Digitized images were obtained with 256 times line averaging and enhanced with Intervision software (NORAN Instruments Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics O2-work station. The promoterless luciferase reporter gene plasmid, pGL3basic (Promega), was used to construct all PAFR promoter reporter plasmids. For the p.98Luc construct, polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the desired 980-bp fragment (–980 to +37) of the human leukocyte promoter 1 of PAFR from the Raji cell line DNA, by using forward (5′-CGTGCGCACAGGTCTTATATCTTGTAAGATGACT-3′) and reverse (5′-GTCTGTCGTATCTCCGACTCCGACCTTCGAACG-3′) primers. The p0.16Luc construct (PAFR promoter sequence from –157 to +37) was prepared by MluI-AccI digestion of the p0.98Luc and treating the product with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I before self-ligation. Cells were transfected in 24-well plates with a total of 0.4 μg of cDNAs. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. In the present study, we investigated whether the Jak/STAT signal transduction pathway was activated upon PAF stimulation of human monocytic cell lines U937 and MonoMac-1. Cells were stimulated with PAF for 1 min, in the absence or presence of WEB 2086, a PAF-specific antagonist. Cellular extracts were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyk2 antibodies and revealed with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. As illustrated in Fig. 1, Tyk2 exhibited a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation even in quiescent MonoMac (Fig.1 A) and U937 (Fig. 1 B) cells. PAF induced a significant increase in Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation after 1 min, and this increase was completely blocked by WEB 2086 in both MonoMac and U937 cells, indicating a receptor mediated signaling. In kinetic studies shown in Fig. 2, A andB, PAF promoted a rapid (within 1–2 min) and transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 in MonoMac cells. Equivalent amounts of Tyk2 proteins were present in immunoprecipitates, as detected by reblotting of membranes with anti-Tyk2 antibody. Jak2 was also phosphorylated in response to PAF but not Jak1 or Jak3 (results not illustrated). Next, we examined whether Tyk2 could be activated in a reconstructed system. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with PAFR and Tyk2 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2,C and D, PAF also stimulated an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 in cells cotransfected with PAFR and Tyk2. This increase was reproducible, but at lower levels than the increase in the myeloid cells, possibly due to the high basal phosphorylation levels of the transfected Tyk2. Interestingly, when Jak2 was co-transfected with Tyk2 and PAFR, Tyk2 phosphorylation achieved the same levels as in MonoMac cells (results not shown).Figure 2Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PAF. A, MonoMac-1 cells were stimulated with PAF (10−8m) for the indicated times. Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as in Fig. 1. B, densitometry ratios of pTyk2/Tyk2 are shown as fold induction, the ratio for unstimulated cells (NS) being set at 1. Results are mean of three independent experiments ± S.E. C, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with PAFR and Tyk2, and 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with PAF for the indicated times. Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as in Fig. 1. D, densitometry ratios of pTyk2/Tyk2 are shown as fold induction, the ratio for unstimulated cells (NS) being set at 1. Results shown are representative of five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction between PAFR and Tyk2 was first examined by confocal microscopy. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, in MonoMac cells, both the PAFR (top panels, green) and Tyk2 (center panels, red) had a predominantly plasma membrane distribution. In transfected Cos-7 cells, c-Myc-tagged PAF receptors (Fig. 3 B, top panels) were localized in the plasma membrane, whereas Tyk2 (red staining) was mainly distributed in intracellular compartments, with some clusters found at the cellular membrane in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 A, middle panels, NS). When the two labels were overlaid, the yellow areas indicate the co-localization of PAFR and Tyk2. The majority of the colocalized proteins was found in the plasma membrane regions (Fig. 3, Aand B, bottom panels), and PAF stimulation did not change either the localization of Tyk2 or the intensity of the co-localization (Fig. 3, A and B, PAF), indicating that PAF stimulation did not induce a redistribution of Tyk2. To confirm that Tyk2 could associate with PAFR, lysates from transiently cotransfected COS-7 cells with c-Myc-tagged PAFR and Tyk2 cDNAs, unstimulated or stimulated with PAF, were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc antibodies. Protein complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Tyk2 Abs. Data shown in Fig. 3 C indicate that in both unstimulated and stimulated cells, Tyk2 coprecipitated with PAFR (top panel). This finding suggests that Tyk2 constitutively associates with the receptor independently of ligand binding. No difference was observed in the amount of PAFR in each lane (Fig. 3 C, bottom panel) when the membrane was reblotted with an anti-c-Myc Ab. Under the same conditions, we were unable to immunoprecipitate Jak2 with the PAFR, before or after PAF stimulation (results not shown). To determine which region of Tyk2 bound PAFR, we used truncation mutants of the kinase. COS-7 cells were transfected with PAFR and Tyk2 (WT and mutants). Fig.4 shows that mutants containing all or parts of the N terminus could immunoprecipitate with the PAFR. The membrane was first immunoblotted with an Ab that recognizes the N terminus of Tyk2 (Fig. 4, top panel) and then stripped, and an anti-HA Ab was used to reveal the HA tag incorporated into the 263–601 construct, because the epitope recognized by the anti-Tyk2 Ab had been deleted in this mutant (middle panel). Thebottom panel shows that equivalent amounts of PAFR had been immunoprecipitated. Activation of the Jak family of kinases by cytokine receptors is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT family of transcription factors. In order to determine whether PAFR signaling also involved the STATs, these proteins were immunoprecipitated from unstimulated and PAF-stimulated MonoMac-1 cells. As shown in Fig.5, PAF induced a time-dependent, transient, 2–4-fold increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1α and STAT2 and a sustained 2–6-fold increase in STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, as determined by densitometric analysis. Weak activation of STAT3 (1.3–2-fold) was detected in PAF treated cells (Fig.6 C), but no PAF-induced STAT4 or STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed (data not shown). Interestingly, STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation persisted on a relatively high level over the time period tested (1 h), whereas for STAT1α and STAT2, a peak of phosphorylation was observed at 5–15 min, which declined to basal level by 60 min.Figure 6Nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT3 in response to PAF. A, COS-7 cells transfected with c-Myc-tagged PAFR, Tyk2, and STAT1α or STAT3 cDNAs were analyzed by confocal microscopy prior to (left) (NS) or 30 min following (right) treatment with PAF (10−7m). Images in all panels are of different cells. PAFR was visualized with anti-c-Myc Ab and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary Ab (green), and STATs were detected by incubation with corresponding anti-STAT Ab and rhodamine-conjugated secondary Ab (red). B,MonoMac-1 cells were stimulated with PAF (10−8m), stained with corresponding anti-STAT Abs and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary Abs (green). Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (red).C, MonoMac-1 cells were treated 30 min with 500 units of interferon-γ or 20 ng/ml of IL-6 stained with anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 Abs (green) and propidium iodide (red). Translocation of STATs in response to both cytokines is seen in the overlapped image (yellow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) STAT phosphorylation induced by growth factors and cytokines results in the translocation of the phosphorylated STATs to the nucleus. We next sought to confirm that PAF-induced phosphorylation of STATs correlates with functional activation of these proteins. We investigated the effect of PAF on the subcellular localization of STAT1α and STAT3. We concentrated on these two STATs as they have putative binding sites in the promoter 1 of PAFR. For these experiments, we employed COS-7 cells transiently expressing PAFR, Tyk2, and STAT1α or STAT3 cDNAs (Fig. 6 A) or MonoMac-1 cells (Fig. 6, B andC). Nuclear translocation was analyzed by confocal microscopy prior to or following stimulation with PAF for 30 min. In the transfected, unstimulated cells, STAT proteins were distributed diffusely in the intracellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 6 A, left panels, red staining). The PAF receptor was found predominantly on the cellular membrane (Fig.6 A, left panels, green staining). However, after treatment with PAF (10−7m) for 30 min, STAT1α and STAT3 were detected predominantly in the nucleus (Fig.6 A, right panels, red staining), and the PAFR could be seen internalizing in vesicles (Fig. 6 A, right panels, green staining). STAT translocation was not observed in the absence of cotransfected Tyk2 (results not illustrated). Comparable results were obtained after PAF stimulation of MonoMac cells. Fig. 6, B and C, shows MonoMac 1 cells with STAT1 and STAT3 stained green and the nucleus stained red with propidium iodide; in unstimulated cells (NS, left panels), STAT1 protein was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, but some was also found in the nuclear area, whereas STAT3 was distributed exclusively in the cytoplasm. After PAF stimulation (Fig. 6 B, right panels), the majority of both STAT1 and STAT3 translocated to the nucleus (yellow). Interferon-γ and IL-6 were used as controls for translocation of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (Fig.6 C). PAF has been reported to in"

NRE represses the transcription activation function of the upstream regulatory sequence of core promoter and the second enhancer. In this study, we described the cloning and characterization of an NRE-binding protein (NREBP) through expression cloning. NREBP cDNA is 8266 nucleotides in size and encodes a protein of 2386 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 262 kDa. Three previously described cDNAs, DBP-5, SONB, and SONA, are partial sequence and/or alternatively spliced forms of NREBP.

HBV is a small enveloped DNA virus with a partially double-stranded 3.2-kb genome. The genome contains four partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) coding for the surface, core, polymerase, and X proteins. The transcription of these open reading frames is under the control of four promoters (two surface promoters, one core promoter, and one X promoter) and two enhancers (enhancer I and enhancer II). Core promoter produces two 3.5-kb RNAs: the precore and pregenomic RNAs. Precore RNA encodes precore protein and e antigen. Pregenomic RNA not only serves as the mRNA that encodes core and polymerase proteins but also can be packaged into nucleocapsids along with viral polymerase, serving as the template for reverse transcription. Regulated expression of pregenomic RNA plays a pivotal role in the control of the viral replication cycle. The core promoter can be divided into two elements: the basal core promoter (BCP) and the core upstream regulatory sequence (CURS). CURS can activate the adjacent downstream BCP activity in cis. Interestingly, the CURS is also colocalized with the second enhancer (ENII) in the HBV genome (1Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-L. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ENII can activate the surface and X promoters in a position- and orientation-independent manner (2Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4281-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CURS/ENII displays a differentiated liver cell specificity (3Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is the combined effect of several liver-enriched transcription factors, such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (4López-Cabrera M.

We have previously identified a negative regulatory element (NRE) located upstream of CURS/ENII. NRE can effectively abolish the transcription stimulatory function of both CURS and ENII from a nearby upstream position (16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal essential sequence required for the NRE function has been mapped (16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lo W.-Y. Negative Regulatory Element and Its Binding Protein of Hepatitis B Virus Ph.D thesis. National Yang-Ming University, 1997Google Scholar). A trans-acting factor present in the nuclear extracts derived from a human hepatoma cell line can specifically bind to this region (16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of an NRE binding protein, NREBP. NREBP bears strong homology to previously described cDNAs: DBP-5, SONA, and SONB. Antiserum raised against NREBP recombinant protein can specifically abolish the nuclear extracts to form an NRE-protein complex in gel shifting assays. Recombinant NREBP can specifically interact with wild type but not mutated NRE sequence. PCR-assisted binding site selection assay reveals that the optimal sequence for binding to NREBP is a perfect match for the NRE sequence. Overexpression of NREBP enhances the transcription repression of core promoter mediated by NRE. Overexpression of NREBP also represses the viral replication and gene expression in a HBV replication system. A λ ZAPII cDNA library was made from messenger RNA isolated from human hepatoma HepG2 cells according to the manufacturer's recommendation. This library was screened with concatemerized double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides of wild type NRE sequence. The oligonucleotides we used contained the wild type NRE sequence, gatctGAGACCACCGTGAACGCCCATCAGg, and its complement, which corresponded to the sequence from nucleotide 1613 to 1636 of the HBV genome (uppercase letters). A BglII and aBamHI overhang (lowercase letters) were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-end of this oligonucleotide. The HBV sequence used in the study is of theadw subtype. Numbering of the HBV sequence begins at the unique EcoRI site, which is nt 1. Plasmids pSV2CAT, pNRE-CP-CAT, pCP-CAT, pBCP-CAT, and pHBV3.6 were described previously (1Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-L. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant GST-BP15 and S.Tag-BP15 expression plasmids, pGST-BP15 and pET-BP15, were generated by cloning of a 1.6-kbEcoRI fragment containing the BP15 cDNA into theEcoRI site of pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pET29b vector (Novagen), respectively. The plasmid pCMV-f:BP15 was generated by cloning of the same 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site downstream of a CMV immediate early promoter of the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). The plasmid pCMV-f:A1 was generated by cloning of a 5-kbBamHI–XhoI fragment containing the A1 cDNA into BglII and SalI sites downstream of a CMV immediate early promoter of the pFLAG-CMV2 vector. All of these constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using appropriate sequencing primers. GST-BP15 fusion protein was expressed and purified as previously described (18Huang C.-J. Chen Y.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purified GST-BP15 protein was separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and eluted with electroelutor (Bio-Rad). Protein eluent was concentrated with a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon), left on ice for 2–3 h, centrifuged to remove SDS, and then dialyzed against renaturation buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) at 4 °C for 24 h. Recombinant GST-BP15 after renaturation was then used as antigen to immunize rabbit. Expression of recombinant S.Tag-BP15 protein tagged with S.Tag was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then purified by S-protein-agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Purified recombinant S.Tag-BP15 protein was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify the recombinant S.Tag-BP15 protein, a side strip of membrane was cut out and then blocked in TBST buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% gelatin at room temperature for 30 min. This membrane strip was then incubated with S-protein alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a 1:2500 dilution at room temperature for 30 min, washed four times with TBST buffer for 4 min at room temperature, and developed with developer solution. The part of the nitrocellulose membrane containing the recombinant S.Tag-BP15 protein was carved out and incubated in renaturation buffer containing 5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. This membrane strip was then washed with PBS three times for 10 min each. To affinity-purify the rabbit antiserum, crude antiserum was incubated with renatured membrane strip at room temperature for 3.5 h. The membrane strip was washed at room temperature once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 for 10 min and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Bound antibody was eluted in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, at room temperature for 2 min. An equal volume of 10% bovine serum albumin was added to the eluent, which was then dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline overnight. For Western blot, differentiated human hepatoma HuH-7 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells, respectively, were transiently transfected with pFLAG-CMV2, pCMV-f:BP15, and pCMV-f:A1. Total cell lysates were collected for Western blotting with purified anti-BP15 antibody as previously described (19Lai C.-K. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, 25 μg of proteins of HuH-7 crude nuclear extracts and 15 μg of proteins from 0.4 m NaCl step-eluted, fractionated nuclear extracts were used for Western blotting with purified anti-BP15 antibody. Proteins were typically separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. HuH-7 cells cultured on slides were transiently transfected with pFLAG-CMV2, pCMV-f:BP15, and pCMV-f:A1 plasmids, respectively. Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (19Lai C.-K. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous NREBP protein was detected by purified anti-BP15 antibody, while overexpressed f:BP15 and f:A1 proteins were detected by anti-FLAG antibody. Preparation of crude and fractionated nuclear extracts from cultured cells was performed as previously described (1Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-L. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shifting analysis was performed as previously described (6Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For blocking experiments, an appropriate amount of anti-GST or anti-GST-BP15 antisera, respectively, was preincubated with the 0.4m NaCl step-eluted nuclear extracts on ice for 25 min before the addition of labeled probe. The probe we used was concatemerized double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild type or mutant NRE (5′-gatctTCTCAACAAGTGAACGCCCATCAGg-3′ and its complement with mutation from nt 1613 to 1621) sequence of HBV. The probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Recombinant GST-BP15 protein or affinity-purified f:BP15 protein with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) used for the Southwestern assay was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was renatured and blocked in renaturation buffer containing 5% nonfat milk for 8 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated in DNA binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.25% nonfat milk, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) containing radiolabeled probe at 106 cpm/ml at room temperature for 6 h. After washing three times with the binding buffer for 30 min, the membrane was subject to autoradiography. Binding site selection assay was a modification of the assay described by Pollock and Treisman (20Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The sequence of degenerate template is 5′-TCTGCAGTCACTAGCANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNACTGAGCATGCATGCT-3′.Primers for PCR amplification are 5′-TCTGCAGTCACTAGCA-3′ and 5′-AGCATGCATGCTCAGT-3′. Recombinant GST-BP15 protein was immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane, renatured in renaturation buffer containing 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C, and then incubated with 200 ng of concatemerized double-stranded degenerate template oligonucleotides in a DNA binding buffer at room temperature for 1 h. After wash with the binding buffer, bound DNA was eluted with elution buffer (0.5m ammonium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) at room temperature for 30 min. After phenol/chloroform extraction, bound DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and then amplified by PCR. After five rounds of binding, elution, and amplification, PCR products were cloned. Individual clones were then isolated and sequenced. For reporter gene experiment, transfection of human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and HuH-7 was performed with 2.7 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of CH101, 0.91 μg of pFLAG-CMV2, or 2 μg of pCMV-f:A1 expression plasmid and carrier plasmid as previously described (19Lai C.-K. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCH101 contained a β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer and served as a control for normalizing transfection efficiency. Plasmid pFLAG-CMV2 was used to calculate the relative activity. Each set of experiments was performed with two different preparations of plasmids and repeated two to three times for each preparation. The CAT activity was measured by a PhosphorImager and normalized against β-galactosidase activity. For HBV replication experiment, 25 μg of the plasmid HBV 3.6, which contained more than a unit length of HBV viral genome (1Yuh C.-H. Chang Y.-L. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4073-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transfected into HuH-7 cells in a 15-cm plate with either no plasmid, 15.9 μg of pFLAG-CMV2, or 35 μg of pCMV-f:A1 and carrier plasmid, respectively. At day 3 posttransfection, total RNAs were collected for Northern blotting analysis, while culture media were collected for endogenous DNA polymerase activity. Purified inserts containing BP9, BP15, 6-1, GAPDH, and β-actin cDNAs were labeled with the random priming method and used as probes, respectively. Preparation of total cellular RNA from human hepatoma HepG2 and HuH-7 and Northern hybridization using BP9, BP15, and 6-1 probes were performed as previously described (19Lai C.-K. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from different adult human tissues (CLONTECH) were used for Northern blotting analysis with BP9, BP15, and 6-1 as probes. The same blots were reprobed with β-actin probe. In the HBV replication experiment, total cellular RNA was collected at day 3 posttransfection. Forty μg of total RNA of each sample was analyzed by Northern hybridization. The probe was a PstI fragment of pHBV3.6 containing the HBV sequence from nt 25 to 1989. The same blot was then reprobed with GAPDH to ensure equal loading of RNA samples. To assay for endogenous DNA polymerase activity, the culture supernatant containing virions and core particles was collected 3 days after transient transfection, treated with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 4 h at room temperature, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 227,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet from the second centrifugation, which contains HBV viral core particles, was resuspended in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and assayed for endogenous polymerase activity as previously described (19Lai C.-K. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRE is a sequence element that represses the transcription activation function of the adjacent ENII and core promoter in the HBV genome. Mutational analysis reveals the minimal essential sequence, nt 1613–1621, within NRE that is required for its function (16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lo W.-Y. Negative Regulatory Element and Its Binding Protein of Hepatitis B Virus Ph.D thesis. National Yang-Ming University, 1997Google Scholar). This sequence is bound specifically by nuclear proteins derived from differentiated human hepatoma HepG2 cells (16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To search for NRE-binding protein(s), we performed expression cloning using labeled concatemers of oligonucleotides of NRE sequence to screen a cDNA library made from HepG2. Three overlapping cDNAs, BP4, BP9, and BP15, were obtained (Fig.1). Sequence analysis reveals a long open reading frame (ORF) shared by these cDNAs. The gene encoded by these cDNAs is referred to as NREBP. The longest BP9 cDNA is 5145 nt in size. Northern analysis using BP9 cDNA as probe showed that NREBP transcripts had apparent sizes of 8.3 kb and greater than 10 kb (see below). To obtain full-length NREBP cDNA, we used sequence from the 3′-end of BP9 to screen an adult human liver cDNA library. A cDNA clone, A1, was obtained that was 5539 nt in size. A1 represented the 3′ portion of the NREBP transcript, since it contained both translation stop codon and a poly(A) tract at its 3′-end. 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed, and an additional cDNA clone, 6-1, was obtained that represented further 5′ extension. The combined sequence information from BP9, A1, and 6-1 reveals a NREBP cDNA that is 8266 nt in size. The translation start codon is located at nt 50 within the sequence context of GCCAUGGCG, which conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence, (A/G)CCAUGG. The stop codon is located at nt 7208. An ORF from nt 50 to 7207 encoding a protein of 2386 amino acids is predicted. The predicted molecular mass of NREBP protein is 262 kDa. An upstream in-frame stop codon is noted at nt 29 of the 5′-end of the cDNA, indicating that we have cloned the entire ORF for NREBP. NREBP protein does not appear to contain any known DNA binding motif. Interestingly, seven different repeats are present in the amino acid (aa) sequence (Fig. 1). Repeat 1, which is composed of a 10-aa unit, LA(S/T)(N/S/G)(T/S)MDSQM, is repeated 13 times and occupies the position from aa 726 to 855. Repeat 2, present in 11 copies from aa 872 to 948, is composed of 7 amino acids, (D/R)PYR(L/I)(A/G)(Q/H/P). Nine copies of the repeat 3, PAYERSMMS, is present from aa 973 through 1045. There are three copies of the repeat 4, PPLPPEEPP(T/M/E)(M/T/G), from aa 1107 to 1139. Four copies of repeat 5, VLESSAVT, occupy the position from aa 1319 to 1350. Six copies of repeat 6, which is composed of PSRRSRT, is located at the segment from aa 1913 through 1954. Two copies of repeat 7, which is composed of PSRRRRSRSVVRRRSFSIS, are present from aa 1894 to 1912 and from 1955 to 1973, respectively. In addition, the region from aa 1090 to 1361 is rich in acidic amino acids, while the region from aa 1787 to 2009 is rich in basic amino acids. A search of the data base reveals that the genomic region containing the NREBP gene has been completely sequenced (DDBJ accession number AP000046). The NREBP gene spans ∼35 kb and contains 13 exons and 12 introns. The sizes of exons and introns and splicing junction sequences are shown in Table I. The combined NREBP cDNA contains exons 1–12, exon 13a, and intron 3. The NREBP gene has been mapped to chromosome 21q22.1 (21Khan I.M. Fisher R.A. Johnson K.J. Bailey M.E.S. Siciliano M.J.

A 8.3-kb NREBP transcript was detected. Furthermore, poly(A)+ RNAs from a variety of human tissues were subject to Northern analysis with BP9 (Fig. 2 B) and BP15 (data not shown) as probes, respectively. Two transcripts were found, one at 8.3 kb and the other at greater than 10 kb. The 8.3-kb transcript was the major one. NREBP transcripts could be detected in all tissues. The highest expression was seen in leukocyte and heart, followed by lymph node, spinal cord, ovary, testis, thymus, spleen, pancreas, placenta, and brain. Weaker expression was seen in colon, small intestine, prostate, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, and lung. To study the localization and expression of the NREBP protein, polyclonal anti-BP15 antiserum was generated after immunizing rabbits with recombinant GST-BP15 protein. This antiserum was then affinity-purified using a recombinant S.Tag-BP15 protein. The localization of the endogenous NREBP protein in HuH-7 cells was examined by immunofluorescence using purified anti-BP15 antibody. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, the endogenous NREBP protein was localized in the nucleus. Two truncated forms of NREBP protein (f:BP15 and f:A1), tagged with a FLAG epitope at their N terminus, were overexpressed in HuH-7 cells by transient transfection. Transfection with an insertless, parental vector, pFLAG-CMV2, was performed, which serves as negative control. Both f:BP15 and f:A1 proteins in transfected HuH-7 cells were localized in the nucleus as revealed by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3, middle and bottom panels). HuH-7 cells transfected with a parental vector did not produce any signal (data not shown). To identify the endogenous NREBP protein by Western blotting, crude nuclear extracts from HuH-7 cells were loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column and step-eluted with NaCl at increasing concentrations. Each fraction was then collected and tested for binding to the NRE sequence. As previously observed, the NRE-binding protein was present in the 0.4m fraction (16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complex appeared to be specific for NRE, since it could be competitively abolished by wild type NRE sequence but not by mutant NRE or random sequence (16Lo W.-Y. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When crude and 0.4 m NaCl fraction of fractionated nuclear extracts were examined by Western blotting with purified anti-BP15 antibody, several proteins were detected. The apparent molecular mass of the largest one was about 257 kDa, which was consistent with the expected molecular mass of protein encoded by the full-length NREBP, 262 kDa (Fig. 4). Proteins of smaller sizes may represent processed or degraded products, translation products from alternatively spliced transcripts, or products derived from internal initiation. No signal was seen with the preimmune serum (data not shown). The expression of f:BP15 and f:A1 proteins was examined by Western blotting using purified anti-BP15 antibody. The expression of f:BP15 in HuH-7 transient transfectants could be detected, although the apparent molecular mass was larger than expected (138 and 130 kDa instead of 63.5 kDa; Fig. 5 A). The same result was obtained in 293T cells after transient transfection (Fig.5 B). The expression of f:A1 in HuH-7 transient transfectants could not be detected by Western blotting, because the level of f:A1 expression was significantly lower than that of f:BP15 (Fig.5 A). However, the expression of f:A1 in 293T transient transfectants could be detected, although the apparent molecular mass of f:A1 was 217 and 197 kDa, which is larger than the expected molecular mass of 165.5 kDa (Fig. 5 B). That the apparent molecular mass of f:BP15 and f:A1 was larger than expected is probably due to the high content of proline residues in NREBP. HuH-7 and 293T cells transfected with an insertless parental control vector did not produce any signal by Western blotting analysis. To test whether NREBP is the endogenous protein that binds to the NRE sequence, we performed gel shifting assays. When the 0.4 m fraction of fractionated nuclear extracts was preincubated with anti-BP15 antiserum, the formation of DNA-protein complex was abolished (Fig.6, lane 4). Control anti-GST antiserum did not have any effect (lane 3). This result indicates that NREBP is indeed the endogenous protein that binds to NRE sequence in 0.4 mfractionated nuclear extracts. To test whether NREBP protein can bind to the NRE sequence specifically, the f:BP15 protein produced by the transiently transfected HuH-7 cells was purified by affinity column chromatography coated with anti-FLAG antibody and then transferred to nitrocellulose membr"

In contrast to earlier proposals, benzoate was not converted into hydroxybenzoate or gentisate. Rather, benzoyl-CoA was a product of benzoate catabolism in both microbial species under aerobic conditions in vivo. Benzoyl-CoA was converted into various CoA thioesters by cell extracts of both species in oxygen- and NADPH-dependent reactions. Using [ring-(13)C(6)]benzoyl-CoA as substrate, cis-3,4-[2,3,4,5,6-(13)C(5)]dehydroadipyl-CoA, trans-2,3-[2,3,4,5,6-(13)C(5)]dehydroadipyl-CoA, the 3,6-lactone of 3-[2,3,4,5,6-(13)C(5)]hydroxyadipyl-CoA, and 3-[2,3,4,5,6-(13)C(5)]hydroxyadipyl-CoA were identified as products by NMR spectroscopy. A protein mixture of A. evansii transformed [ring-(13)C(6)]benzoyl-CoA in an NADPH- and oxygen-dependent reaction into 6-[2,3,4,5,6-(13)C(5)]hydroxy-3-hexenoyl-CoA. The data suggest a novel aerobic pathway of benzoate catabolism via CoA intermediates leading to beta-ketoadipyl-CoA, an intermediate of the known beta-ketoadipate pathway."

Cathepsins are expressed differentially in antigen presenting cells, and mice deficient in cathepsin S or cathepsin L exhibit severely impaired antigen presentation in peripheral lymphoid organs and the thymus, respectively. To determine whether these defects are due solely to the block in invariant chain cleavage, we used cathepsin-deficient B cells to examine the role of cathepsins S and B in the degradation of other molecules important in the class II presentation pathway. Our data indicate that neither cathepsin S nor B is critical for H-2M degradation or processing of precursor γ-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) to a mature thiol reductase, but suggest a role for cathepsin S in the turnover of mature GILT and in regulating levels of mature cathepsin L protein in B cells. Despite the presence of mature cathepsin L protein, no enzyme activity could be detected in B cells or dendritic cells.

CatL, however, was detected only in Mφs and cortical thymic epithelial cells, where a defect resulted in severely impaired CD4+ T cell selection. In addition to catS and catL, a third cysteinal cathepsin, cathepsin F, has been recently implicated in Ii degradation and Ag presentation in alveolar Mφs (24Shi G.P. Bryant R.A. Riese R. Verhelst S.

Thus, it would appear that different APCs utilize distinct cathepsins to mediate late stage Ii degradation and regulate MHC class II presentation. Cathepsins are synthesized in an inactive precursor form, becoming active upon autocatalytic cleavage of the pro-region (25Salminen A. Gottesman M.M. Biochem.

In DCs it has been shown that activity of catS correlates inversely with expression levels of cystatin c (31Pierre P. Mellman I. Cell. 1998; 93: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), a known inhibitor of catS and catL (32Leonardi A. Turk B. Turk V. Biol. Chem.

Other studies have suggested intracellular cathepsin expression in Mφs and Mφ cell lines can be regulated by increasing or decreasing cathepsin mRNA levels (34Liuzzo J.P. Petanceska S.S. Moscatelli D. Devi L.A. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 320-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang Z. Zheng T. Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Riese R.J. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Exp.

Med. 1999; 5: 320-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that cathepsin activity can be controlled in many ways and determining the role for each regulatory mechanismin vivo would enhance our understanding of Ag presentation. The importance of cathepsins in regulating the MHC class II presentation pathway is indicated by the phenotype of APCs from catS and catL knockout mice (20Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A.

However, their role in mediating late stage Ii degradation is unlikely to explain fully the defects in Ag presentation. The observation that exogenous Ag presentation is defective in catS-deficient B cells and DCs, whereas endogenous Ags are presented normally (21Nakagawa T.Y. Brissette W.H. Lira P.D. Griffiths R.J.

In addition, recent studies have implicated various cysteinal cathepsins with turnover of the accessory molecule H-2M (36Pierre P. Shachar I. Matza D. Gatti E. Flavell R.A. Mellman I. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and cleavage of the precursor form of the thiol reductase GILT (37Phan U.T. Arunachalam B. Cresswell P. J. Biol.

This enzyme is expressed constitutively in APCs, where it colocalizes with MHC II molecules (38Arunachalam B. Pan M. Cresswell P. J.

Cresswell, manuscript in preparation.2M. Maric and P. Cresswell, manuscript in preparation. No role for GILT in Ii degradation has been observed in these mice, suggesting their cathepsin activity is not impaired in the absence of this thiol reductase.2 In this study, we have explored the mechanism by which catL activity is regulated and the role of cathepsins in regulating the expression of GILT and H-2M in vivo. Here we show that B cells and DCs express a 20-kDa form of catL protein that corresponds to mature catL. However, we were unable to detect activity of this enzyme in these cells. The level of mature catL protein in B cells was dependent upon catS, suggesting that catS plays a role in turnover of mature catL protein. CatS may also play some minor role in the turnover of GILT, while the turnover of the accessory molecule H-2M was independent of both catS and catB, both of which are active in B cells. These results demonstrate catL activity is tightly regulated and suggest B cells and DCs may express a catL-specific inhibitor. C57BL/6 (BL6) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms Inc. (Germantown, NY) and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Washington. CatS−/−, catL−/−, catB−/−, and catS−/−xcatB−/−animals were bred and maintained under these same conditions. All animals were used at 6–12 weeks of age. All procedures and care of the animals was in accordance with University of Washington guidelines. The polyclonal rabbit antisera to mouse catL was a gift of A.

To isolate highly purified populations of B cells, splenocytes were stained with magnetic MHC class II microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and positively selected over two columns on an automated magnetic cell separator (AutoMACS, Miltenyi Biotec). Purity of the positive fraction was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were stained with anti-B220 fluorescein isothiocyanate (Phar- Mingen, San Diego, CA) and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using Cell Quest (Becton Dickinson) software.

Splenocytes were stained with magnetic CD11c microbeads (Milteyi Biotec), positively selected on an AutoMACS and the purity of the positive fraction assessed by flow cytometric analysis as described above. Cells were stained with anti-CD11c fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-CD11b-phycoerythrin (both PharMingen), and all positive fractions were >96% CD11chi. The peritoneal cavity was enriched for macrophages (pMφs) by intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of 10% thioglycollate. Cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage 4 days later. An equal number of cells per sample (numbers as indicated in the text) were lysed on ice for 40 min in 25 μl of cell lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.2) supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 min, and the lysates boiled for 5 min in SDS-reducing buffer. The total lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide, w/v) and the proteins electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, which was probed for protein using the appropriate primary antibody. Binding was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) diluted 1:1500 and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An equal number of cells per sample (numbers as indicated in the text) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.25 μm cysteine protease inhibitor Cbz-125I-Tyr-Ala-CN2 (44Mason R.W.

This radiolabeled inhibitor binds irreversibly to the active site cysteine via a thioester bond. Cells were lysed as above, separated in 12% SDS-PAGE, and the labeled proteins visualized by exposure to Kodak BioMax MR film.

Cells were pulsed for 40 min by addition of 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN) and chased for 0, 1, 3, 6, 15, and 24 h in the presence of 30× unlabeled methionine (3 mm) and cysteine (16 mm). Pulse-labeled cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01 mTris, pH 7.3, 0.15 m NaCl supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prior to precipitation with the antisera or antibody indicated in the text, lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for rabbit antisera immunoprecipitations or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for H-2M immunoprecipitation and then with 10 μl of normal rabbit serum or 18 μg of normal rat IgG (Caltag Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) as appropriate. Precipitated proteins were boiled in SDS-reducing buffer and separated by 7.5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and the labeled proteins visualized by exposure to Kodak BioMax MR film. Cells were lysed in RNA STAT-60 (10–20 × 106 cells/ml RNA STAT-60; Tel-Test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX), the RNA extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol and contaminating DNA removed by treating 2-μg samples of RNA with amplification grade DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription using the Life Technologies Superscript™ first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR, as directed by the manufacturer. Primer and probe sequences were selected with the assistance of Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using nucleotide sequences available in the GenBank™ data base (accession numbers NM_013556 and X06086 for HPRT and catL, respectively). Primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were: HPRT-F, 5′-3′ (5′-TGGAAAGAATGTCTTGATTGTTGAA-3′); HPRT-R, 5′-3′ (5′-AGCTTGCAACCTTAACCATTTTG-3′); catL-F, 5′-3′ (5′-GACCGGGACAACCACTGTG-3′); catL-R, 5′-3′ (5′-CTACCCATCAATTCACGAC-3′). Probes were synthesized with a 5′ FAM reporter and 3′ TAMRA quencher (Biosearch Technologies Inc., Novato, CA): HPRT, 5′-6-FAM-CAAACTTTGCTTTCCCTGGTTAAGCAGTACAGC-TAMRA-3′; catL, 5′-6-FAM-CTCAGGTGTTTGAACCCATGAATCTTTTACTC-TAMRA-3′. Real-time PCR amplification was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) in optical tubes (Applied Biosystems) and a total volume of 50 μl. All reagents used were obtained from Applied Biosystems unless otherwise specified. PCR amplification of 0.5 μl of cDNA was performed in the presence of 5 μl of 10× Mg2+-free reaction buffer, a final concentration of 3.5 mm Mg2+, the dNTPS (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dUTP) each at a final concentration of 0.2 mm, 0.5 units of uracil N-glycosylase, 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 4 μl of enzyme grade glycerol (Fisher Biotech, Fairlawn, NJ), a final concentration of 0.2 μm fluorescent probe and two primers, each at a final concentration of 0.5 μm for HPRT and 0.2 μm for catL. PCR conditions consisted of 2 min at 55 °C, during which uracil N-glycosylase degrades any contaminating DNA from previous assays, 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 37 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 65 °C for 1 min. Triplicates of each cDNA sample were amplified alongside appropriate controls. Each assay was performed on at least three independent occasions. Relative quantitation of catL expression was determined using the comparative CT method (user bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). This method was used to calculate the -fold increase in catL cDNA in catS−/−-derived cells when compared with BL6 cells. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that activity of catS and catL is detected differentially in APCs,e.g. B cells and DCs express only active catS, whereas catB is expressed ubiquitously (21Nakagawa T.Y. Brissette W.H. Lira P.D. Griffiths R.J. Petrushova N. Stock J. McNeish J.D. Eastman S.E. Howard E.D. Clarke S.R. Rosloniec E.F. Elliott E.A. Rudensky A.Y.

Rev. 1999; 172: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here we sought to investigate further the mechanisms regulating discrete expression of catS and catL by analyzing the protein levels of these cathepsins in APCs. Highly purified B cells were isolated from the spleens of BL6, catS−/−, and catL−/− mice and analyzed by immunoblotting. 2.5 × 106 cell equivalents were loaded per lane and the membranes probed with rabbit antisera specific for catL (Fig.1 A), demonstrating the presence of catL in B cells. The catL detected in the B cells was the same size (20 kDa) as mature catL detected by active site labeling (20Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A. Farr A. Deussing J. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H. Peters C. Rudensky A.Y. Science. 1998; 280: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). 3C. Beers, K. Honey, and A. Rudensky, manuscript in preparation. In the absence of catS, the level of catL protein was increased when compared with the BL6 B cells. This increase was not due to loading unequal amounts of protein in the different wells as the same membranes probed for actin indicated equal protein loading (Fig. 1 B). Similar analysis of protein lysate from 1 × 106 purified DCs isolated from BL6 and catS−/− mice indicated that mature catL was also present in DCs (Fig. 1 C). However, the catL protein levels were the same in both wild-type and catS−/− DCs, as were the actin levels, which indicated equal protein loading (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether the catL protein observed in B cells and DCs was active, the same number of purified cells as used for immunoblotting were incubated in the presence of the irreversible cysteine protease inhibitor Cbz-125I-Tyr-Ala-CN2 (Fig.1 D). No catL activity could be detected in either B cells or DCs, although both active catS and catB were present, indicating that the inhibitor had been internalized by the cells and that culture conditions were permissive for its binding to active site cysteines. Having observed that the level of catL protein in B cells is increased in the absence of catS, whereas in DCs the level is constant in the presence or absence of catS, we wanted to analyze catL protein levels in pMφs from BL6 and catS−/− mice. The level of catL protein in pMφs is much greater than in either B cells or DCs3; therefore, a serial dilution of protein was performed to enable us to detect any potential differences between samples. Protein lysate from BL6 and catS−/− pMφs was serially diluted 2-fold, from 40 μg of protein to 312.5 ng of protein, the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, and the membranes probed with anti-catL rabbit sera (Fig. 2). For both BL6 and catS−/− pMφs, the mature, 20-kDa form of catL could be detected at the first three protein concentrations and the 36-kDa pro-form of catL at the first five. This demonstrated that in pMφs, as in DCs, catL protein levels are independent of catS. The finding that, in B cells, the level of catL protein is enhanced in the absence of catS led us to consider two possibilities for this: 1) transcription of catL mRNA is increased, or 2) degradation of catL protein is mediated either directly or indirectly by catS. We aimed to investigate the first possibility using a quantitative PCR technique. B cells were purified from the spleens of BL6 and catS−/− mice, RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesized. Real-time PCR amplification and subsequent quantitation indicated the level of catL mRNA was not significantly different in BL6 and catS−/− mice (Fig.3). Having excluded the possibility that catL transcription was increased in the absence of catS, we attempted to determine whether the kinetics of catL degradation were altered in catS−/−mice. However, despite numerous attempts, we were unable to specifically detect catL protein by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Thus, we have shown that an increase in transcription of catL mRNA is not the mechanism by which the mature form of catL protein is accumulated in catS-deficient B cells, and we suggest that this may be due to slowed protein degradation. We have shown previously that, in catS-deficient B cells, exogenous antigen presentation is severely impaired and that the late stages of Ii chain cleavage are blocked (21Nakagawa T.Y. Brissette W.H. Lira P.D. Griffiths R.J. Petrushova N. Stock J. McNeish J.D. Eastman S.E. Howard E.D. Clarke S.R. Rosloniec E.F. Elliott E.A. Rudensky A.Y. Immunity. 1999; 10: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the block in Ii chain degradation may be a major factor resulting in deficient antigen presentation in catS−/− B cells. Our data presented here, indicating a role for catS in regulating protein levels of catL, led us to study the role of catS in the degradation of H-2M and GILT, two other important molecules in the antigen presentation pathway. To assess the kinetics of H-2M degradation, B cells were purified from BL6, catS−/−, catB−/−, and catS−/−xcatB−/−spleens; pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine; and chased for 0, 1, 5, 15, and 24 h before immunoprecipitation with the H-2M-specific rat monoclonal antibody, 2C3A. Fig.4 shows that degradation of both the α and β chains of H-2M have the same kinetics in BL6 control B cells as in cells derived from catS-deficient mice, indicating no major role for catS in the turnover of this important accessory molecule. In studies using cathepsin inhibitors, other laboratories have suggested a role for catB in degradation of the β chain of H-2M in mature bone marrow-derived DCs (36Pierre P. Shachar I. Matza D. Gatti E. Flavell R.A. Mellman I. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By using catB-deficient mice, we show here that in B cells the kinetics of both H-2Mα and H-2Mβ turnover are unaffected by the presence or absence of catB (Fig. 4). B cells from mice deficient in both catS and catB also degrade H-2M with the same kinetics as the control (Fig. 4), indicating no redundancy between these two cathepsins in H-2M turnover. As previously observed in B cells by others (46Karlsson L. Peleraux A. Lindstedt R. Liljedahl M. Peterson P.A"
https://openalex.org/W1595867980,"Currently, there is substantial evidence that nuclear lipid metabolism plays a critical role in a number of signal transduction cascades. Previous work from our laboratory showed that stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts with α-thrombin leads to the production of two lipid second messengers in the nucleus: an increase in nuclear diacylglycerol mass and an activation of phospholipase D, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid. Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, making it an attractive candidate for a signal transduction component. There is substantial evidence that this activity is indeed regulated in a number of signaling cascades (reviewed by van Blitterswijk, W. J., and Houssa, B. (1999) Chem. Phys. Lipids 98, 95–108). In this report, we show that the addition of α-thrombin to quiescent IIC9 fibroblasts results in an increase in nuclear DGK activity. The examination of nuclei isolated from quiescent IIC9 cells indicates that DGK-θ and DGK-δ are both present. We took advantage of the previous observations that phosphatidylserine inhibits DGK-δ (reviewed by Sakane, F., Imai, S., Kai, M., Wada, I., and Kanoh, H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 8394–8401), and constitutively active RhoA inhibits DGK-θ (reviewed by Houssa, B., de Widt, J., Kranenburg, O., Moolenaar, W. H., and van Blitterswijk, W. J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6820–6822) to identify the activity induced by α-thrombin. Constitutively active RhoA inhibited the nuclear stimulated activity, whereas phosphatidylserine did not have an inhibitory effect. In addition, a monoclonal anti-DGK-θ antibody inhibited the α-thrombin-stimulated nuclear activity in vitro. These results demonstrate that DGK-θ is the isoform responsive to α-thrombin stimulation. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses showed that α-thrombin induced the translocation of DGK-θ to the nucleus, implicating that this translocation is at least partly responsible for the increased nuclear activity. Taken together, these data are the first to demonstrate an agonist-induced activity of nuclear DGK-θ activity and a nuclear localization of DGK-δ.

They are intermediates in phospholipid biosynthesis, cofactors for certain membrane-associated activities, and serve as second messengers. In addition to the widely accepted role of DAG in activating protein kinase C, it also modulates other signaling proteins such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factors vav (1Gulbins E.

Williamson P. Smith K. Gaulton G.N. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, local alterations in membrane physical properties mediated by changes in lipid composition may regulate the function of membrane-binding proteins (recently reviewed in Ref. 7Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Given their critical role in signaling cascades, it is not surprising that the levels of both DAG and PA are tightly regulated. One enzyme reportedly involved in this regulation is diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) (8van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DGK catalyzes the phosphorylation of DAG by converting it to PA, thereby reducing one second messenger in exchange for another. Indeed, there is increasing evidence suggesting that DGK is involved in regulating DAG and PA levels in some signaling pathways. For example, DGK has been shown to be modulated in response to various growth factors and hormones, such as noradrenaline (5Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Clearly, understanding the mechanisms that regulate DGK in various signaling cascades will be essential to delineating the physiological roles of this enzyme. Defining mechanisms involved in regulating DGK activity requires knowledge of the structural features of the enzyme. This analysis is complicated by the fact that nine mammalian DGK isoforms, organized into five subfamilies, have been identified. All mammalian DGKs contain a conserved catalytic region and at least two cysteine-rich domains. However, they are distinguished by the presence of specific domains, such as EF hands (DGK-α, DGK-β, and DGK-γ), pleckstin homology (DGK-δ, DGK-η, and DGK-θ), ephrin homology (DGK-δ), myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate homology domain (DGK-ι and DGK-ζ), or ankyrin repeats (DGK-δ and DGK-ζ) (recently reviewed in Refs. 20Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar and21). The structural diversity among the DGK family members suggests that each isoform performs specific functions and is regulated by different mechanisms. This hypothesis is underscored by observations that DGK isoforms show distinct tissue-specific and subcellular distributions (20Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 21van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a nuclear localization has been reported for four DGK isoforms, DGK-α, DGK-ζ, DGK-ι, and DGK-θ. Wada et al. (14Wada I. Kai M. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) show that DGK-α translocates to the nuclear matrix in rat thymocytes and in peripheral T-lymphocytes. DGK-ζ overexpressed in COS-7 cells was found in the nucleus (22Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the data in this study indicates that a protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation resulted in the redistribution of the enzyme to the cytosol (22Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that noradrenaline induces a redistribution of DGK-θ concomitant with an increase in DGK-θ activity in rat small arteries (10Walker A.J. Draeger A.

We have demonstrated that the stimulation of quiescent IIC9 cells with α-thrombin leads to an increase in nuclear PC-derived DAG mass and an activation of nuclear phospholipase D (24Baldassare J.J.

In the studies presented in this report, we demonstrate that another nuclear lipid-metabolizing enzyme, DGK-θ, is modulated in response to α-thrombin in IIC9 cells. These cells express three DGK isoforms, DGK-ζ, DGK-δ, and DGK-θ, that are highly homologous to the human isoforms. Two of these isoforms, DGK-δ and DGK-θ, are present in the nucleus. The addition of α-thrombin to quiescent IIC9 cells results in the translocation of DGK-θ to the nucleus and an increase in nuclear DGK-θ activity.

Transient transfections of IIC9 cells were performed with Novafector (Venn Nova) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown in 150-cm2 flasks until 50–60% confluent. Cultures were washed with PBS and incubated with 10 ml of OPTIMEM containing 20 μg of the cDNA-containing vector and 100 μl of Novafector. After an overnight incubation, 10 ml of 10% fetal calf serum-containing complete medium was added, and cells were grown for an additional day before harvesting. Transfection efficiency was quantified in every experiment by cotransfection with pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH). Total homogenates, cytoplasmic fraction, and nuclear samples were prepared as described previously (27Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cultures were harvested in ice-cold PBS. Cells containing suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 rpm in tabletop Sorval centrifuge for 10 min. Total homogenates were prepared by resuspension of the cellular pellets in Fractionation Buffer A (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 200 μm2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenyl carbonate, 20 μm quinacrine, 20 mm NaF) and homogenization on ice in a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer with a type A pestle. Nuclei were isolated from the total homogenates by centrifugation at 400 g (4 °C) for 15 min. The resulting supernatant, i.e.cytoplasmic fraction, was removed, and the nuclei were purified as follows: the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of Fractionation Buffer A and homogenized on ice in a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer with a type A pestle. The nuclei-containing suspension was layered on top of 1 ml of 45% sucrose cushion in a 1.6-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 10,000 g (4 °C) for 20 min. The purified nuclei were either resuspended in the appropriate buffer for each experiment or disrupted as described previously (28Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The purified nuclei were resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml of DNase I and allowed to swell by incubating on ice for 10 min preceding disruption by 60 passages through a 25-gauge hypodermic needle. The protein concentration of all samples was assayed using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). The purity of nuclear preparations was assessed by immunoblotting for tubulin. DGK activity was assayed in vitro using octylglucoside (OG)/DAG mixed micelles. OG/DAG mixed micelles were prepared as follows: a mixture of 0.25 mmdioleoylglycerol, 55 mm OG, and PS (either 1 mm resulting in 1.8 mol% in micelles or 5 mmresulting in 8.3 mol% in micelles) was resuspended in 1 mmdiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, pH 7.4, by vortexing and sonicating until the suspension appeared clear. 20 μl of mixed micelles were added to 70 μl of the reaction mix (final concentration: 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, pH 7.4, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP). 10 μl of total homogenate or isolated nuclei were added to 90 μl of mixed micelles reaction mix solution. The reaction was started by vortexing for 3 s and sonicating for 5 s. After a 30-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol/1% perchloric acid (1:2:0.75, v/v) and then vortexed. 1% perchloric acid and chloroform (1:1, v/v) were added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm in a tabletop Sorval centrifuge at 25 °C. The organic phase was washed twice in 1% perchloric acid, an aliquot was dried under a stream of nitrogen and spotted on a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. PA was separated by developing in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (10:4:3:2:1) (v:v). The amount of [γ-32P]PA was measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. DGK activity was linear with respect to time (15–60 min) and protein concentration (8–150 μg). Total homogenates or nuclear samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. 20 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE in an 8% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked for 1 h in TBS (TBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with the indicated antibodies in TBS for 2 h, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced with chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amino acid sequences of hDGK-α, rat DGK-β, hDGK-γ, hDGK-δ, DGK-ι, hDGK-θ, cDGK-η, hDGK-ζ, rat DGKIII, and pig DGK were aligned using ClustalW. A degenerate oligonucleotide primer (cccctgcttgtgtttgtgaac) was designed corresponding to a highly conserved region (PL(L/I)V(F/L)VNPKSG(G/T)) preceding the putative ATP binding domain. The degenerate nucleotide primer was used as the forward primer with the universal primer T7 as the reverse primer in a PCR reaction on a λzap cDNA library previously created from IIC9 mRNA. A second set of PCR-based amplifications on IIC9 cDNA phage library was performed using primers designed on highly specific regions of DGK-α (forward primer: cggattgaccctgttcctaa; reverse primer: cacaccaaaatccggctatc), DGK-β (forward primer: ttctgcaagtacaccgtcca; reverse primer: cgtggtctgacaccaaacac), DGK-η (forward primer: aaacatcgacccttttggtg; reverse primer: ggaccccataccacatcaag), DGK-ι (forward primer: ctgaggaatcaggccaacat; reverse primer: tagttccccagcaatggttc), and DGK-ζ (forward primer: gctggagacccttcatcatc; reverse primer: ttgtgcactttgcggtacat). All indicated primer sequences are 5′–3′. IIC9 cells were grown on glass coverslips, serum-deprived, and α-thrombin-stimulated in the conditions described previously. After α-thrombin stimulation, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. After fixation in methanol:acetone (1:1, v/v) for 20 min at −20 °C, cells were washed with PBS and rehydrated by incubation in TBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-DGK-θ (1:10), polyclonal anti-DGK-δ (1:100), or monoclonal anti-tubulin (1:100)) for 1 h. After three washes in TBS, cells were incubated with either Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 45 min. Cells were then washed in TBS, and nuclei were stained by incubating with Hoechst stain for 3 min. Finally, cells were washed in distilled water, and the coverslips were mounted on slides on a drop of glycerol containing 0.1 m N-propyl gallate. Images were acquired using a microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence and a charge coupled device camera (Photometric Sensys, Tucson, AZ) using IP Lab software (Signal Analytic Corp., Vienna, VA). Interest in eukaryotic DGKs and their subcellular localization is increasing. Given recent reports of DGKs being present in the nucleus (8van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Walker A.J. Draeger A. Houssa B. van Blitterswijk W.J. Ohanian V. Ohanian J. Biochem.

Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and our interest in nuclear lipid metabolism (29Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2000; 40: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we determined whether nuclei isolated from quiescent IIC9 fibroblasts possessed a DGK activity. The presence of this activity in nuclei isolated from IIC9 cells was quantified in vitro using OG/DAG mixed micelles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because PS is an activator for most DGKs, the nuclear DGK activity was assayed in the presence of either low (1.8 mol%) or high (8.3 mol%) concentrations of PS. Interestingly, increasing the PS concentration from 1.8 mol% to 8.3 mol% resulted in a 3-fold decrease in DGK activity quantified in these nuclei (from 3 × 10−5nmol/μg/min to 1 × 10−5nmol/μg/min) (Fig.1). The above data showed that the nuclear DGK activity in quiescent IIC9 cells was inhibited by a higher concentration of PS (8.3 mol%), suggesting that a PS-sensitive DGK isoform was responsible for the activity. Because only the mammalian DGK-δ isoform is known to be inhibited by PS (30Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it was important to determine whether the DGK-δ isoform was present in the isolated nuclei. Western blot analysis of isolated nuclei was performed using antibodies raised against human DGK isoforms α, γ, δ, ε, ζ, and θ. This analysis indicated that two DGK isoforms, DGK-δ and DGK-θ, were present in IIC9 nuclei (Fig.2, A and B). In addition to these isoforms, Western blot analysis of total cell homogenates showed that IIC9 cells also express DGK-ζ, but this isoform was present only in the cytoplasmic fraction of quiescent IIC9 cells (Fig. 2 C). We further analyzed the endogenous mRNAs using a PCR-based amplification of a cDNA phage library of IIC9 cells. Oligonucleotide primers targeted to conserved regions of 10 cloned DGKs were generated and used in PCR-based reactions (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The 600-base pair PCR product was sequenced and aligned to all the non-redundant GenBankTMCDS translations, Protein Data Bank, Swiss Protein Database, Protein Identification Resource, and PRF nucleotide sequences using the BLASTN program. This analysis revealed the presence of an mRNA with high homology to the human DGK-θ cDNA. A second set of PCR reactions was performed using primers homologous to very specific regions of DGK isoforms -α, -β, -η, -ι, and -ζ (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Only the reaction performed with the specific primers for DGK-ζ gave a PCR product from which the sequence was highly homologous to human DGK-ζ (data not shown). In previous studies, our laboratory demonstrated that α-thrombin stimulation of IIC9 cells results in the activation of a nuclear PC-PLD and an increase in nuclear DAG mass (24Baldassare J.J. Jarpe M.B. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Jarpe M.B. Adams L.D. Fabbro D. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21816-21822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of our observation that IIC9 nuclei contain a DGK activity, we asked whether nuclear DGK activity was also modulated in response to α-thrombin. IIC9 cells were brought to quiescence by serum deprivation for 48 h. Quiescent cells were stimulated with α-thrombin (2 NIH units/ml) for 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were isolated, and DGK activity was quantified using OG/DAG mixed micelles containing either no PS or 8.3mol% PS. As shown in Fig. 3 A, nuclear DGK activity peaked within 3–5 min and then declined to a level near basal at 30 min. Consistent with results shown in Fig. 1, the basal nuclear DGK activity decreased when assayed in the presence of high PS (8.3 mol%) (Fig. 3 B). However, the relative increase of α-thrombin-induced nuclear DGK activity over the basal nuclear activity was not inhibited by the presence of PS (Fig.3 C). These data indicate that the α-thrombin-induced nuclear DGK activity was not inhibited by PS. Taken together, the above data indicate that the basal DGK activity in IIC9 nuclei is inhibited by PS (Figs. 1 and 3, A and B), whereas the α-thrombin-stimulated DGK activity is not inhibited by PS (Fig. 3). One explanation for this observation is that DGK-δ, known to be inhibited by PS (30Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), is responsible for the basal nuclear DGK activity, whereas DGK-θ is activated upon α-thrombin stimulation. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of PS on DGK-θ. Although several reports suggest that PS activates DGK-θ, there are no published data demonstrating the effect of"
https://openalex.org/W2076469829,"The bacteriophage T4 59 protein (gp59) plays a vital role in recombination and replication by promoting the assembly of the gene 41 helicase (gp41) onto DNA, thus enabling replication as well as strand exchange in recombination. Loading of the helicase onto gp32 (the T4 single strand binding protein)-coated single-stranded DNA requires gp59 to remove gp32 and replace it with gp41. Cross-linking studies between gp32 and gp59 reveal an interaction between Cys-166 of gp32 and Cys-42 of gp59. Since Cys-166 lies in the DNA binding core domain of gp32, this interaction may affect the association of gp32 with DNA. In the presence of gp32 or DNA, gp59 is capable of forming a multimer consisting of at least five gp59 subunits. Kinetics studies suggest that gp59 and gp41 exist in a one-to-one ratio, predicting that gp59 is capable of forming a hexamer (Raney, K. D., Carver, T. E., and Benkovic, S. J. (1996) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 271, 14074–14081). The C-terminal A-domain of gp32 is needed for gp59 oligomer formation. Cross-linking has established that gp59 can interact with gp32-A (a truncated form of gp32 lacking the A-domain) but cannot form higher species. The results support a model in which gp59 binds to gp32 on a replication fork, destabilizing the gp32-single-stranded DNA interaction concomitant with the oligomerization of gp59 that results in a switching of gp41 for gp32 at the replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1984861964,"The cellular response to toxic stimuli is elicited through the expression of heat shock proteins, a transcriptional process that relies upon conserved DNA elements in the promoters: the Heat Shock Elements, activated by the heat shock factors, and the CCAAT boxes. The identity of the CCAAT activator(s) is unclear because two distinct entities, NF-Y and HSP-CBF, have been implicated in the HSP70 system. The former is a conserved ubiquitous trimer containing histone-like subunits, the latter a 110-kDa protein with an acidic N-terminal. We analyzed two CCAAT-containing promoters, HSP70 and HSP40, with recombinant NF-Y and HSP-CBF using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, protein-protein interactions, transfections and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) assays. Both recognize a common DNA-binding protein in nuclear extracts, identified in vitro and in vivo as NF-Y. Both CCAAT boxes show high affinity for recombinant NF-Y but not for HSP-CBF. However, HSP-CBF does activate HSP70 and HSP40 transcription under basal and heat shocked conditions; for doing so, it requires an intact NF-Y trimer as judged by cotransfections with a diagnostic NF-YA dominant negative vector. HSP-CBF interacts in solution and on DNA with the NF-Y trimer through an evolutionary conserved region. In yeast two-hybrid assays HSP-CBF interacts with NF-YB.

A crucial aspect of the heat shock response is the rapid and massive production of distinct classes of related proteins conserved in evolution; based on their molecular weight, three major families of heat shock proteins (HSPs)1 are catalogued: middle HSPs, 64/74 kDa HSPs; large HSPs, 90/110 kDa; and small HSPs, 27/40 kDa (1Ohtsuka K. Hata M. Int. J. Hyperth. 2000; 16: 231-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The whole process is controlled by increasing the expression of the respective set of genes at the transcriptional level (2Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is mediated by the heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), which are present in a monomeric, non-DNA binding form in the cytoplasm of unstressed cells. Upon activation, HSFs rapidly form homotrimers, which translocate into the nucleus and bind to discrete palyndromic sites (heat shock elements (HSEs)) present in the promoters. In all cases tested so far, HSEs work in conjunction with, and indeed require, nearby elements such as GC and CCAAT boxes. Among heat shock promoters, HSP70s are perhaps the most thoroughly studied. In essentially all species HSP70 promoters contain CCAAT boxes (4Hunt C. Calderwood S. Gene. 1990; 87: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Dix D.J. Rosario-Herrle M. Gotoh H. Mori C.

The exception is represented byDrosophila, which has no CCAAT boxes in their HSP70 promoters, a fact that is mirrored by the conspicuous absence of this element in any type of promoter. In addition to the HSP70 family, human HSP105 and HSP40 also contain CCAAT sequences, and as far as the HSP40 is concerned, they have also been shown to be important for expression (21Hata M. Ohtsuka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Yasuda K. Ishihara K. Nakashima K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1999; 256: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The CCAAT box is present not only in heat shock genes, but it is indeed one of the most widespread cis-acting elements, being found in 30% of eukaryotic promoters (23Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In many DNA binding activators the acronym CCAAT is present: CTF/NF1 (CCAAT transcription factor), C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) and CDP (CCAAT displacement protein). However, in the HSP system two polypeptides have been directly implicated in CCAAT box function: NF-Y and CBF, hereafter renamed HSP-CBF to avoid confusion with CBF, which is another acronym of NF-Y (24Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). NF-Y is a complex composed of three subunits: NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, all required for DNA binding. A large body of evidence indicates that NF-Y binds and activates many if not most CCAAT boxes in diverse promoters in different kingdoms: yeast, plants, and mammals (24Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Two of the subunits, NF-YB and NF-YC, contain histone-like domains required for dimerization, association of NF-YA and CCAAT binding. Two large Q-rich domains are present in NF-YA and NF-YC and function in activation assays. At first sight, the CCAAT boxes found in the HSP70 promoters across species match very well the NF-Y consensus obtained by the alignment of a compilation of >300 sites (26Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) 2R. Mantovani, unpublished data. and experimentally derived with site-selection analysis (27Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Analyzing theXenopus HSP70, the group of A. Wollfe came to the conclusion that the CCAAT box is instrumental in maintaining an open chromatin configuration of the promoter so that HSF could rapidly activate (20Landsberger N. Wollfe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Evidence that Xenopus HSP70 activation is elicited through interactions of NF-Y with the p300 coactivator has been presented (28Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wollfe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).In vivo footprinting experiments in mouse cells are supportive of this idea because CCAAT boxes are protected constitutively prior of the heat shock, whereas the HSEs become bound by HSFs activators only following the thermal stimulation (29Abravaya K.

On the other hand, work on the human HSP70 promoter pointed to a different protein as crucial for CCAAT box activation. Screening of an expression library with multimerized HSP70 CCAAT-containing oligonucleotides lead to the identification of HSP-CBF, a cDNA coding for a 999-amino acid protein (32Lum L.S.Y.

Wu B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). HSP-CBF is ubiquitous and highly conserved in many species; the Saccharomyces cerevisiae equivalent, Mak21p, is an essential gene (34Edskes H.K. Ohtake Y. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28912-28920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It contains a highly acidic N-terminal domain, usually a hallmark for transcriptional activators, and indeed expression of HSP-CBF in COS cells increased the activity of the human HSP70 promoter in a CCAAT-dependent way. GAL4 fusion experiments further pinpointed two regions important for transcriptional activation: the acidic N-terminal domain and a central part highly conserved across species (35Lum L.S.Y. Hsu S. Vaewhongs M. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal part of HSP-CBF is contacted by the viral oncogene E1A (36Agoff S.N. Wu B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3707-3711PubMed Google Scholar) and by the anti-oncogene p53 (37Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Science. 1992; 259: 84-87Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar); E1A and p53 have opposite effects on HSP-CBF; the former increases, while the latter represses HSP-CBF-mediated activation (37Agoff S.N.

To solve the issue of which protein is the bona fide activator of heat shock genes CCAAT boxes, we employed recombinant proteins in EMSA and immunoprecipitation assays in vitro and expression vectors and antibodies for chromatin immunoprecipitations in vivo on two promoters representative of the HSP70 and HSP40 families. HSP-CBF cDNAs (wt and mutants) were cloned into the His- and thioredoxin tagged PET32 expression vector using the NcoI site; mutants 1–533, 1–366, and 1–100 were derived by cutting with EcoRI,XhoI, and HindIII, respectively, and religating.

The His-less NF-YB and NF-YA proteins were produced from PET3b, and NF-YC from the His-tagged PET32 was modified to eliminate the thioredoxin tag by cutting with NdeI and religating. NF-YA and NF-YB subunits were found in inclusion bodies and were resuspended in 6 m GnCl. Equimolar amounts of the recombinant proteins were renatured by slowly dialyzing away the denaturing agent, and the resulting material was centrifuged to remove precipitates, loaded on an NTA-agarose column, and purified according to standard procedures. HSP-CBF proteins were purified from soluble fractions. For production of HSP-CBF in vitro, the transcription/translation TnT system (Promega) was employed. For protein-protein interaction studies, 50–100 ng of recombinant proteins were incubated in 200 µl of 300 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, and then added to 25 µl of protein G-Sepharose to which 5 µg of the anti-NF-YA Mab7 monoclonal antibody had been previously bound. Incubation was pursued for 2 h at 4 °C, unbound material was recovered after centrifugation, and the beads were washed with NDB100 with the addition of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. SDS buffer was added, and the samples were boiled at 90 °C for 5 min and loaded on SDS gels. Western blots were performed according to standard procedures with the indicated primary antibody and revealed with a Pierce peroxidase secondary antibody. The anti-HSP-CBF antibody was a kind gift of D. Linzer, Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays32P-labeled fragments, 10000 cpm, are incubated in NF-Y buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) with 5 µg of CH27 nuclear extract or with the recombinant proteins in a total volume of 10 µl; after incubation for 15 min at 20 °C, we added 2 µl of 1× NF-Y buffer containing bromphenol blue and samples loaded on a 4.5% polyacrylamide in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA. The oligonucleotides used were the following: HSP70, 5′-CTCATCGAGCTCGGTGATTGGCTCAGAAGGGAAAA-3′and 5′-TTTTCCCTTCTGAGCCAATCACCGAGCTCGATGAG-3′; and HSP40, 5′-AGGGCGGCGGCGATTGGCCGGCGCCGCGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGCGGCGCCGGCCAATCGCCGCCGCCCT-3′. For supershift experiments, we used 300 ng of anti-NF-YA Mab7, anti-NF-YB, anti-NF-YC and anti-Gata1, and 100–300 ng of anti-HSP-CBF. The eukaryotic expression vector for HSP-CBF has been described (32Lum L.S.Y. Sultzman L.A. Kaufman R.J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6709-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2.5 × 104 COS or SAOS2 cells were transfected with 0.5 µl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 24-well plate using different doses of the activating vectors, 0.1 µg of Xenopus HSP70-CAT (gift of N. Landsberger, Univ. Insubria, Varese, Italy) or HSP40-luciferase DNA (gift of K. Ohtsuka, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan), 50 ng of Nβ -galactopyranoside as an internal control and various amounts of carrier pGEM plasmid to keep the total DNA concentration constant at 1 µg. Cells were recovered 24/36 h after transfection, washed in phosphate-buffered solution (150 mm NaCl and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and resuspended in TEN (150 mm NaCl and 40 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4) for measurements of β-galactosidase and CAT or luciferase activities. Heat shocks were performed 30 h post-transfection, by placing the plates for 90 min at 42 °C; following a change of medium, cells were recovered after 5 h. A minimum of three independent transfections in duplicate were performed. Standard deviations represented <20% of the values. Formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described in Ref.41Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were washed in phosphate-buffered solution and incubated for 10 min with the cross-linking solution, containing 1% formaldehyde; after quenching the reaction with glycine 0.1 m cross-linked material was broken by sonication into chromatin fragments of an average length of 500/1000 base pairs. Immunoprecipitation was performed with ProtG-Sepharose. The chromatin solution was precleared by adding ProtG-Sepharose for 15 min at 4 °C, aliquoted, and incubated with 2 µg of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C with mild shaking. Before use, ProtG-Sepharose was blocked with 1 µg/µl sheared herring sperm DNA and 1 µg/µl bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C and then incubated with chromatin and antibody overnight. Immunoprecipitates were eluted, and ethanol was precipitated. Recovered material was treated with proteinase K, extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated. The pellets were resuspended in 30 µl of H2O and analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction with the following primers specific for the human HSP70 promoter: coding 5′-GGCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGA-3′, non-coding 5′-AGCCTTGGGACAACGGGAG-3′; for the DHFR promoter: coding 5′-GGCCTCGCCTGCACAAATAGGG-3′, non-coding 5′-GGGCAGAAATCAGCAACTGGGC-3′. The input sample was resuspended in 100 µl of H2O and diluted 1:100. The yeast strain used was PJ69–4A, which contains three Gal4 inducible promoter elements fused to selection and reporter genes (42James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain was transformed with plasmid pAS2–1 in which HSP-CBF-1–566 was cloned withNcoI-EcoRI in frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain, AS2.1-HSP-CBFN, generating the strain PJ69-AS2.1-HSP-CBFN. This strain was then transformed with the pACT2 plasmid (CLONTECH) containing the NF-YB gene, clonedBglII-EcoRI in frame with the GAL4 activation domain. Transformants were plated onto synthetic media plates lacking histidine, adenine, tryptophan, and leucine and containing 2% dextrose as a carbon source and 1 mm 3-aminotriazole. His+ colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay; colonies grown on selective plates were replica-plated on nitrocellulose filters, dipped in liquid nitrogen to permeabilize cells, thawed, and placed in a Petri dish containing Whatman No. 3MM paper saturated with Z buffer containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. CCAAT boxes are conserved in the HSP70 promoters across species and are found, among others, in the human HSP40 promoter. To characterize the proteins binding to them, we performed EMSA analysis with nuclear extracts of mouse CH27 cells and two probes representative of these families: the human HSP70 proximal −70 base pairs and human HSP40 proximal −100 base pairs CCAAT boxes, both shown to be essential for the full activities of the two promoters (15Wu B. Kingston R. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Greene J.M. Larin Z. Taylor I.C.A. Prentice H. Gwynn K.A. Kingston R.E. Mol.

Ohtsuka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A single complex was observed with both oligonucleotides (Fig.1, A and B,lanes 2). In parallel, we incubated Escherichia coli, produced NF-Y in the same assay, and promptly observed complexes (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1); it was immediately apparent that the complexes generated with nuclear extracts and with recombinant NF-Y had similar electrophoretic mobilities. Both the HSP70 and HSP40 complexes were specifically self- and cross-competed by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the two CCAAT boxes but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide harboring the MHC class II Ea X box (Fig. 1, A and B,lanes 3–8). These complexes were also supershifted by anti-NF-YB and anti-NF-YC antibodies and inhibited by the anti-NF-YA Mab7 monoclonal (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 9–13). These results establish conclusively that the more readably seen DNA-binding protein in EMSA assays is NF-Y and represents the first demonstration that NF-Y is the HSP40 proximal CCAAT-binding protein. In an initial attempt to verify the relative affinity of NF-Y and HSP-CBF for the CCAAT boxes of the HSP genes, we cloned HSP-CBF into the PET32 E. coli expression vector. Recombinant HSP-CBF was produced and purified using the His-tag of the protein on NTA nickel columns; most of the resulting HSP-CBF is proteolytically cut to a size of 55 kDa. We employed this material in EMSA analysis; no binding of the recombinant HSP-CBF was observed on either targets even at very high dosages (1 µg, not shown). Because of the poor yield of intact bacterial HSP-CBF, we turned to a TnT transcription/translation system; HSP-CBF was abundantly produced in an intact form as checked by [35S]methionine labeling of the protein (Fig.1 C). This material was used for EMSA as above, and again no binding was observed. We systematically modified the concentrations of salts, divalent cations, and detergents; we were incapable of observing specific CCAAT binding of HSP-CBF on the HSP70 or HSP40 CCAAT probes (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1–4). EMSAs with HSP70 and HSP40 CCAAT oligonucleotides were then performed with both recombinant proteins. Addition of the two proteins in the buffer conditions described in Ref. 32Lum L.S.Y. Sultzman L.A. Kaufman R.J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6709-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar yielded a faint complex migrating more slowly than the prevalent NF-Y complex (Fig. 1 D, lanes 5–8); this upper complex was NF-Y-dependent because it was competed by cold CCAAT oligonucleotides and supershifted by anti-NF-Y antibodies (not shown). In no other buffer conditions was this upper complex detectable with the HSP40 or the HSP70 probe (Fig.1 E). The presence of HSP-CBF in the higher complexes was confirmed by supershift experiments with purified rabbit antibodies against HSP-CBF (Fig. 1 F). Although these data do not rule out completely the possibility that HSP-CBF binds DNA, they establish (i) that a clear difference in affinities between recombinant NF-Y and HSP-CBF exists under standard EMSA conditions, and (ii) that NF-Y can associate HSP-CBF, albeit with apparent modest affinity and strict buffer requirements, when bound to DNA in vitro. To verify the ability of NF-Y to interact with the HSP70 promoter in vivo, we employed ChIP on growing HeLa cells. The cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody against NF-YB. As negative controls, we included a reaction lacking a primary antibody and one that contained an antibody against E2F1, an abundant nuclear transcription factor that does not have a binding site on the HSP70 promoter. After immunoprecipitation and reversal of the cross-links, enrichment of the endogenous HSP70 promoter fragment in each sample was monitored by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers amplifying the human HSP70 promoter region from −117 to +75 base pairs. The results show that only the anti-NF-Y antibody immunoprecipitates chromatin containing the HSP70 promoter (Fig.2 A). This result mirrors the binding of NF-Y to other promoters of cell cycle-regulated genes 3A. Gurtner and G. Piaggio, submitted for publication.. To rule out unspecific effects of the ChIP assays performed with the anti-NF-YB antibody, the same immunoprecipitate was also used to amplify DHFR, a CCAAT-less cell cycle-regulated promoter; no amplification was observed (Fig. 2 B), which is consistent with the lack of NF-Y binding sites on this promoter. These results provide in vivoevidence for a specific retention of NF-Y to the HSP70 promoter, indicating that this transcription factor plays a critical role in the activation of the HSP70 gene. Functional assays have indicated that the human HSP70 promoter is activated in a CCAAT-dependent way by HSP-CBF (32Lum L.S.Y. Sultzman L.A. Kaufman R.J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6709-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Lum L.S.Y. Hsu S. Vaewhongs M. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given the results obtained in our in vitro EMSA analysis, we felt it important to verify this point. To this aim, we cotransfected a CAT reporter gene driven by the XenopusHSP70 promoter that shows identical architecture and similar sequence to the human counterpart with a HSP-CBF expression plasmid in COS and SAOS2 cells. COS cells were chosen because, unlike CHO cells, they were shown to be permissive to HSP-CBF activity; the p53−/−SAOS2 were chosen because of the possible interfering role of p53 on HSP-CBF activation (37Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Science. 1992; 259: 84-87Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, HSP-CBF overexpression leads to a 4–5-fold increase in promoter activity in COS cells. The effect is strictly dependent upon the integrity of the CCAAT boxes because a promoter containing mutations in the two CCAAT boxes, HSP70mut in Fig. 3 A, does not respond to HSP-CBF overexpression. To establish the specific role of NF-Y in such system, we cotransfected a highly diagnostic vector coding for the DNA binding-defective NF-YAm29 mutant; the protein produced by this construct acts in a dominant negative fashion associating the NF-YB-NF-YC dimer and preventing the endogenous trimer to bind CCAAT boxes (43Mantovani R. Li X-Y. Pessara U. Hoof van Huijsduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, CAT activity was not enhanced by HSP-CBF. Next, we heat shocked COS cells cotransfected as above and found that (i) the levels of CAT activity are, as expected, increased upon heat treatment, an effect that requires intact CCAAT boxes (20Landsberger N. Wollfe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,44Minuzzo M. Marchini S. Broggini M. Faircloth G. d'Incalci M. Mantovani R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In another set of conceptually similar experiments, we employed the human HSP40 promoter, from position −227 to +30, which contains two CCAAT boxes at −100 and −220 and an HSE at -70. This promoter is inducible upon heat shock at 42 °C in HeLa cells (21Hata M. Ohtsuka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

McLean C.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The extracellular amyloid plaques consist of aggregates of amyloid β-peptide isoforms, which are proteolytically derived from the amyloid precursor protein by two proteases, β- and γ-secretases. Until recently, the identities of these proteases have been elusive. Within the past 2 years the involvement of presenilins in γ-cleavage (2Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T.

Even though the BACE polypeptide sequence appears to be most closely related to the pepsin aspartic protease family (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Maendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B.

The proposed chemical mechanism for aspartic proteases involves activation of the attacking water molecule by the general base Asp-COO− with concomitant protonation of the substrate carbonyl by a general acid Asp-COOH, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate amide hydrate (7Suguna K. Padlan E.A. Smith C.W. Carlson W.D. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7009-7013Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The statine moiety of pepstatin constitutes a tetrahedral, hydroxymethylene-isosteric replacement for the scissile peptide bond, mimicking the putative reaction intermediate and resulting in potent inhibition of aspartic proteases. Several attempts to design β-secretase inhibitors, based on this chemical mechanism, have been made recently. Incorporation of the statine moiety into the P10-P4′ peptide 2The amino acid residues of the protease substrate have been numerically designated as Pn for residues N-terminal of the scissile bond and Pn′ for residues C-terminal of the scissile bond. The designations P1-P1′ indicates the amino acids between which hydrolysis occurs. This nomenclature system was first defined by Schechter and Berger (21Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4765) Google Scholar). representing the Swedish variant of the substrate sequence (Lys → Asn/Met → Leu at the P2-P1 positions) resulted in moderate inhibition of BACE (IC50 ∼ 40 μm(8Sinha S.

Seubert P. Suome S.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar)). Substitution of the P1′ position Asp by Val in the same peptide resulted in a much more potent peptidomimetic inhibitor (IC50 ∼ 30 nm (8Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suome S.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar)). Likewise, the replacement of the peptide bond between P1 and P1′ by a hydroxyethylene isostere in a substrate octapeptide, together with a Asp → Ala substitution at the P1′ position, yielded an inhibitor with an IC50 of ∼1 nm (9Ghosh A. Shin D. Downs D. Koelsh G. Lin X. Ermolieff J. Tang J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3522-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 10Ermolieff J. Loy J.A. Koelsch G. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The latter inhibitor was co-crystallized with a truncated version of BACE, and a significant number of protein-inhibitor interactions have thus been defined (11Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The interactions of eight residues of the inhibitor with BACE include four hydrogen bonds between two active site aspartates and the hydroxyl of the transition state isostere and 10 hydrogen bonds from different parts of the cleft and flap of the protein to the inhibitor backbone. Interestingly, binding of peptidomimetic inhibitors to the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 protease involves substantial conformational changes, especially in the flap region, where backbone movements as large as 7 Å are observed (12Miller M. Schneider J. Sathyanarayana R.K. Toth M.V. Marshall G.R. Clawson L. Selk L. Kent S.B.H. Wlodawer A. Science. 1989; 246: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Considering the mechanistic similarity between BACE and human immunodeficiency virus protease, binding of peptidic inhibitors to BACE is likely accompanied by similar flap (residues VPYTQGKW) movement, and the tryptophan (Trp137) in the flap region would be expected to provide a fluorescence probe for structural change studies. Additionally, pepstatin has been shown to be a slow and tight binding inhibitor of another aspartic protease, pepsin (13Cho Y.-K. Rebholtz K.L. Northrop D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); hence, one might anticipate that the slow onset of inhibition is related to conformational changes accompanying inhibitor binding. In this paper we report the kinetics of BACE inhibition by a statine-based inhibitor. These data are accompanied by stopped-flow studies of the intrinsic protein fluorescence change upon enzyme-inhibitor and enzyme-substrate complex formation, and the results are interpreted in light of the available three-dimensional structure. The cell line expressing the truncated (C-terminal His-tagged) version of human β-secretase was as described elsewhere (14Mallender W.D. Yager D. Onstead L. Nichols M.R. Eckman C. Sambamurti K. Kopcho L. Marcinkeviciene J. Copeland R.A. Rosenberry T.L. J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). About 300–400 ml of clarified media containing secreted enzyme was dialyzed overnight into phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and loaded onto a 30-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity column. The column was washed initially with 60 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and then with 60 ml of the same buffer, but with the imidazole concentration raised to 20 mm. The protein was eluted with a 20–250 mm linear imidazole gradient. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm triethanolamine, loaded on a HR10 Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl linear gradient. Active fractions exhibiting a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining were pooled and stored in 10% glycerol at −80 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay and by active site titration with the statine-based tight-binding inhibitor (Enzyme Systems Inc.); the results indicated that more than 95% of the total protein was catalytically active. These results were supported by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectroscopy, suggesting that all of the protein was proteolytically activated with the prodomain being cleaved off during expression. 3M.

Enzyme activity was monitored following the increase in fluorescence at 400 nm (excitation at 328 nm) resulting from the cleavage of the peptide: 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-EVNLDAEF(K-dnp)-COOH. Assays were performed in 50 mm acetate buffer with 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 4.5 at 25 °C with 2.5% Me2SO (substrate solvent) present in 96-well plates. Steady-state kinetic studies were performed on a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader. Data were processed using Softmax Pro 3.1.1. Substrate concentration did not exceed 25 μm, since above this concentration a decrease in signal was observed due to the inner filter effect, even though saturation had not been reached (14Mallender W.D. Yager D. Onstead L. Nichols M.R. Eckman C. Sambamurti K. Kopcho L. Marcinkeviciene J. Copeland R.A. Rosenberry T.L. J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies were performed using a known statine-based inhibitor: Ac-KTEEISEVN(statine)VAEF-COOH (Enzyme Systems Inc.). Assays were performed by mixing the enzyme solution (final concentration: 20 nm) with the inhibitor (20–80 nm) and immediately starting the reaction by addition of substrate (final concentration: 25 μm). Progress curves were fit to the Morrison equation (15Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar), modified for the depletion of the free enzyme and free inhibitor populations that occurs, [P]=vst+vi−vs(1−γ)kobsγln1−γexp−kobst1−γEquation 1 γ=[E][I]1−vsvi2Equation 2 where [P], [E], and [I] are the product, enzyme, and inhibitor concentrations, respectively,vi is the initial velocity, vs is the steady-state velocity, and kobs is the pseudo-first order rate constant for the approach to the steady state. Protein fluorescence spectra in the presence and absence of the inhibitor were obtained with a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. An excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used, and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm at room temperature. Rapid kinetic studies were conducted using an Applied Photophysics SX. 18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer with excitation at 280 nm. A glass cutoff filter (WG-320) was installed in front of the photomultiplier. Experiments were performed by rapid mixing of equal volumes of enzyme (final concentration: 6 μm) and inhibitor in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5 at 20 °C. Stopped-flow spectrophotometric data for inhibitor binding were fit using KIMSIM and FITSIM simulation software. In an alternative experiment 3–5 μm of the enzyme was mixed with 5–30 μm substrate (Ac-EVNLDEEF(K-dnp)-OH). Typically, three traces were averaged to yield the final trace. These traces were fit to a double exponential equation andkobs was plotted versus substrate concentration. The statine-containing peptide has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of human brain-derived BACE, displaying an IC50 of 30 nm(8Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suome S.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). We have reevaluated the inhibition of recombinant, truncated human BACE by this compound. Careful analysis of the product progress curves in the presence of this compound (Fig.1 A) revealed curvature consistent with slow onset inhibition (15Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). The biphasic nature of these progress curves was well modeled by Equation 1, allowing estimation of vs, vi, andkobs at each inhibitor concentration. A plot ofkobs as a function of inhibitor concentration (Fig. 1 B) is linear, suggesting either a single simple binding event, as in Scheme 1, or a two-step reaction mechanism (Scheme 2) for which Ki* ≪ Ki (see below). E+I⇄k1k2EI SCHEME 1 E+I⇌k1k2EI⇄k3k4E∗I SCHEME 2The values of k1 andk2 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear fit in Fig. 1 B and were thus determined to be (3.5 ± 0.7) × 104m−1 s−1and (7.8 ± 4.0) × 10−4s−1, respectively. Hence, the value ofKi obtained by the ratiok1/k2 is 22 ± 5 nm, in good agreement with the IC50 reported earlier (8Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suome S.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). For all of the fits in Fig. 1 A, the value ofvs was non-zero, indicating that inhibition is reversible. To confirm this BACE (10 μm) was incubated with inhibitor (10 μm) for 15 min and then diluted ∼2000-fold into the activity assay (final concentration of both enzyme and inhibitor was 5 nm). As seen in Fig.2, this dilution resulted in a slow recovery of enzymatic activity that could be well fit by Equation 1, yielding an estimate of the reactivation rate constantkreact of (9.4 ± 0.3) × 10−4 s−1. We note that the value of kreact andk2 are, within experimental error, the same; this result is consistent with fully reversible inhibition. The statine-based inhibitor is composed of a peptide sequence similar to a known substrate of the enzyme, but the scissile bond is replaced to mimic the tetrahedral reaction intermediate of aspartyl proteases. We assume, therefore, that this inhibitor binds to the enzyme active site, with the statine isostere engaging the active site aspartate residues. We have not, however, been able to experimentally verify the competitive nature of this inhibitor because of the highKm of the substrate, which is beyond the solubility limits of this molecule (14Mallender W.D. Yager D. Onstead L. Nichols M.R. Eckman C. Sambamurti K. Kopcho L. Marcinkeviciene J. Copeland R.A. Rosenberry T.L. J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence we could not achieve sufficient substrate saturation to discern a substrate dependence on inhibition and thus confirm competitive inhibition (16Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of human BACE contains 5 tryptophan residues. When the enzyme (1 μm) is excited with 280 nm light, the fluorescence maximum is observed at 330 nm (data not shown), indicating that the majority of tryptophan residues in this protein experience a hydrophobic environment. The recent crystal structure of the human BACE catalytic domain complexed to a hydroxyethylene-containing peptide inhibitor reveals that there is a tryptophan residue in the “flap” region forming part of the binding pocket of the enzyme. It thus seemed likely that the fluorescence spectrum would be perturbed by ligand binding and subsequent flap movement, providing a convenient biophysical marker of complex formation. Indeed, the fluorescence spectrum of BACE demonstrates a moderate shift of the emission wavelength and a 4.5% increase in fluorescence intensity when the inhibitor (5 μm) is added. These spectral changes are reminiscent of those seen for inhibitor binding to the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 aspartyl protease. In this case the fluorescence changes were associated with movement of the flap region of the enzyme that lays down on top of the inhibitor binding pocket and results in formation of high affinity enzyme-inhibitor complex (17Rodriquez E.J. Debouck C. Deckman I.C. Soud-Abu H. Raushel F.M. Meek T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The spectral changes seen upon inhibitor binding to BACE are too modest to be reliably used to follow complex formation by equilibrium methods. They do, however, provide sufficient signal to follow binding interactions by transient spectroscopic methods. With stopped-flow instrumentation, we have used the changes in BACE tryptophan fluorescence to follow the time course of inhibitor binding. When a 6 μm (final concentration) solution of the enzyme was mixed with 5, 10, or 15 μm solutions of the inhibitor under pre-steady-state conditions, an increase in fluorescence signal was observed (Fig. 3 A). Higher inhibitor concentrations were not experimentally attainable due to the solubility limits of the inhibitory peptide. Hence, pseudo-first order conditions ([I] ≫ [E]) could not be achieved. Decreasing the enzyme concentrations resulted in insufficient signal amplitude. For these reasons in the concentration range of 5–15 μm no dependence of kobs on inhibitor concentration was observed; hence we were not able to estimate k1 and Kd. Therefore, the same data were fit to a simple second order reaction (A + B → C) using the program KINSIM, to obtain estimates ofk1 and k2. Initially, fitting was optimized by incremental adjustment of values of individual rate constants by visual inspection. Once reasonable fits of the experimental data were obtained, final parameter adjustment was made by use of the program FITSIM (Table I). The average value of the second order rate constant (k1) thus obtained from the binding transients was (5.0 ± 1.4) ×104m−1 s−1, which is in good agreement with the value of k1obtained from the measurements of steady-state inhibition (Fig.1 B, (3.5 ± 0.7) × 104m−1 s−1). In contrast, however, the average value of k2from these experiments was (3.3 ± 2.5) × 10−2 s−1, some 43-fold faster than the corresponding rate constant for inhibitor dissociation obtained from steady-state measurements (7.8 ± 4.0) × 10−4s−1. The Kd estimated from these data by the ratio ofk2/k1 is thus 660 nm.Table IKinetic parameters for two-step association of BACE with substrate and inhibitorParameterSubstrate (experimental)Substrate (FITSIM calculated)Inhibitor (experimental)Inhibitor (FITSIM calculated)k13.5 × 105 m−1 s−13.2 × 105m−1 s−13.5 × 104 m−1 s−15.0 × 104 m−1 s−1k26.5 s−13.3 × 10−2 s−1k32.7 s−1k40.1 s−17.8 × 10−4 s−1Kd21.1 μm20.3 μm660 nmKd*(Ki)725 nm22 nmΔΔG1.97 kcal/mol2.01 kcal/molThe constants define the processes in the two-step association mechanism, E+A⇄k1k2EA⇄k3k4E∗Awhere A is either substrate or inhibitor.Kd experimental for the substrate was calculated from Equation 3, and Kd (FITSIM calculated) for the substrate was calculated from the simulated valuesk2/k1.

The discrepancy between the dissociation rate constants determined from pre-steady-state binding and steady-state inhibition measurements suggest a two-step inhibition mechanism, according to Scheme 2 (see above). The stopped-flow measurements essentially report on formation of the initial encounter complex, EI, while steady-state inhibition data reflect formation of the final complex,E*I. The similarity of the measured association rates for the two sets of experiments suggest that a common step is rate-limiting to both processes and must therefore be associated with initial binding of the inhibitor. The steady-state data do not directly reflect the two-step nature of the E*I formation, because the intermediate species EI does not accumulate under our experimental conditions ([I] ≪ Kd). Considering the general ligand interactions with the active site of BACE, we wondered if substrate binding might also proceed through a two-step mechanism like that seen for the inhibitor. To address this we measured the binding of the substrate to the enzyme under pre-steady-state conditions, on a time scale where substrate cleavage and product dissociation is negligible. For these studies we used the 9-residue peptide substrate described under “Experimental Procedures.” This peptide represents the region proximal to the scissile bond of the Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein substrate and contains a dnp chromophore appended to the ε-amino group of the lysyl residue at P5′. The absorbance spectrum of dnp overlaps with the emission spectrum of the tryptophan residues in BACE. Hence, binding of the peptide to the enzyme should result in quenching of the proximal tryptophan fluorescence. Indeed, when the enzyme (3 μm) and substrate (5–40 μm) are mixed, a reduction in fluorescence signal is observed, as illustrated in Fig. 3 B. No recovery of fluorescence intensity is observed over the time course studied (5 s), suggesting that cleavage and product dissociation occur at a rate less than 0.2 s−1. The diminution of fluorescence seen in Fig. 3 B could not be adequately described by a single exponential process. Rather, the time course was best fit to a double exponential model. Similar data were obtained at a number of substrate concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 μm. These two kinetic phases could correspond to a two-step substrate binding mechanism, similar to that proposed for the inhibitor, as represented by Scheme 3. E+S⇄k1k2ES⇄k3k4E∗S SCHEME 3If so, one would expect that for the first phase, corresponding toES formation, kobs1 would display a linear dependence on substrate concentration, with slope andy intercept values equal to k1 and (k2 + k3 +k4) (18Johnson K.A.

The second phase, corresponding to formation of E*S, would be expected to display a hyperbolic dependence of kobs2 on substrate concentration, according to Equation 3, kobs2=k3+k4[S]Kd+[S]+k4Equation 3 where Kd is the dissociation constant for the initial encounter complex, ES (i.e. Kd =k2/k1). The dissociation constant for the E*S binary complex,Kd*, is then given by Equation 4. Kd∗=Kdk4k3+k4Equation 4 The first phase, corresponding to ES formation, could be described by the values of k1(i.e. the slope of the plot in Fig.4 A) of (3.52 ± 0.31) × 105m−1s−1 and (k2 +k3 + k4) (i.e.the intercept of the same plot) of (3.9 ± 0.4) s−1. The second phase (Fig. 4 B), corresponding to formation of E*S, could be described by Equation 3. Assuming that k4 is very small, the Kd and (k3 +k4) values obtained from the data fit to Equation 3 are 21.1 ± 4.9 μm and 2.1 ± 0.2 s−1, respectively. Since calculation of theKd* value from the empirical data was limited by an unknown k4 value, we simulated all four constants. Simulation of the binding progress curve data in Fig.3 B using a two-step substrate binding scheme (using the FITSIM program) yielded the following estimates of the kinetic parameters: k1 = (3.2 ± 0.2) × 105m−1s−1, k2 = 6.5 ± 1.2 s−1, k3 = 2.7 ± 0.3 s−1, and k4 = 0.10 ± 0.05 s−1. The calculated values of Kd and Kd* were thus 20.3 μm and 725 nm, respectively. The calculated values of Kd andk1 are in a good agreement with those determined from the kobs1 and kobs2dependencies on substrate concentration (Table I), which confirms the validity of the proposed two-step substrate binding mechanism. The data presented here suggest that both substrate and inhibitor binding to BACE induce structural rearrangement (most likely flap closing) of the initial enzyme-ligand complex, leading to a higher affinity binary complex. While the association rates for both ligands are significantly slower than the diffusion limit (19Brouwer A.C. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), our kinetic results demonstrate that the substrate binds to free enzyme about 10-fold and dissociates about 200-fold faster than does the inhibitor. These differences between the inhibitor and substrate binding/dissociation could be due to the different length of the peptides, or the Asp → Val substitution at the P1′ position in the inhibitor, which has been reported to increase the affinity more than 1000-fold (8Sinha S. Anderson J.P. Barbour R. Basi G.S. Caccavello R. Davis D. Doan M. Dovey H.F. Frigon N. Hong J. Jacobson-Croak K. Jewett N. Keim P. Knops J. Lieberburg I. Power M. Tan H. Tatsuno G. Tung J. Schenk D. Seubert P. Suome S.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Structural differences between the inhibitor and substrate at the scissile bond position (statine moiety with the 3(S)-hydroxyl group mimicking the reaction intermediate in the inhibitor molecule) could as well contribute to the faster substrate binding, since the free enzyme might be better designed to accommodate the ground state structure (substrate), even though the transition state analog would ultimately display much higher affinity. Finally, displacement of the catalytic water by the 3(S)-hydroxyl group of the statine could account for the slower association of the inhibitor compared with substrate as has been proposed for other aspartyl proteases (13Cho Y.-K. Rebholtz K.L. Northrop D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Rich D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 8556-8560Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Despite the differences in individual rate constants for the two ligands, the thermodynamic changes that accompany binding are remarkably similar. The difference in free energy between the initial encounter complex and the final enzyme-ligand binary complex can be measured from the ratio of dissociation constants for the two enzyme forms, ΔΔG=RTlnKd∗/KdEquation 5 where R is the ideal gas constant and T is temperature (in Kelvin). Using this equation the ΔΔGcalculated for the transition EI → E*I is 2.01 kcal/mol. When the same calculation is performed for the transitionES → E*S, a value of 1.97 kcal/mol is obtained. The close agreement between these values strongly implies that a common set of structural changes are induced to optimize substrate as well as inhibitor interactions with the enzyme. In the absence of crystallographic data for the apoenzyme, it is speculative to correlate the slow step during inhibition with either a conformational change or displacement of a catalytic water. Our comparison of the kinetic data for the substrate and inhibitor indicate, however, that most likely both factors are contributing. Flap movement (conformational change) involved in the binding of both ligands could account for the much slower than diffusion-limited association kinetics, although additional rate limitations occur in the case of the inhibitor, as suggested by our data. This additional limitation could be attributed to the displacement of a catalytic water, since it does not occur during substrate binding; however, more detailed studies would be needed to address this hypothesis further.

Proteins destined for secretion are initially synthesized as precursors on ribosomes, translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and transported through the Golgi stacks to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here the protein is sorted via clathrin-coated vesicles into the RSP consisting of dense core secretory granules or the CSP through small nonclathrin-coated vesicles, which exit from the TGN and rapidly migrate to the plasma membrane (2Burgess T.L.

J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A major unanswered question is the mechanism for sorting prohormone and proneuropeptide precursors in the TGN into either the CSP or RSP (4Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 5Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar, 6Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Sorting is an active process that requires some form of recognition of the secretory protein (2Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar,4Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 5Dannies P.S. Endocr.

It is one step in a multistep cascade during which the prohormone is concentrated over 100-fold, packaged with other granular proteins, extruded into budding secretory vesicles, and proteolytically processed into smaller mature products. These events may be interdependent, and their temporal and spatial relationship remains poorly understood (5Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar, 6Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Three models have been proposed to explain how proteins are sorted to the RSP. The first proposes that regulated secretory proteins possess an intrinsic ability to form aggregates leading to packaging of condensed products into secretory granules, thereby sorting them away from soluble proteins that are carried off by bulk flow in small vesicles. Support for this model comes from the tendency of a number of secretory granule proteins such as prolactin, growth hormone, the chromogranins, carboxypeptidase E (CPE), and prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) to aggregate at the mildly acidic pH in the TGN (7Lee M.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18646-18650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other proteins, such as fibronectin, that aggregate easily are not targeted into the RSP, and modifications on proteins such as chromogranin B and insulin-like growth factor-1 result in missorting without affecting aggregation (13Castle A.M. Schwarzbauer J.E. Wright R.L. Castle J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3827-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B.

Furthermore, GH does not aggregate in the acidic environment of the TGN in COS-7 cells but does so in AtT-20 cells, and blockade of acidification with chloroquin and bafilomycin A1 is without effect on the ability of these hormones to aggregate in secretion granules in GH4C1 cells, suggesting that aggregation alone is not sufficient for sorting into secretory granules (7Lee M.S. Zhu Y.L Chang J.E. Dannies P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 715-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The second model assumes that regulated secretory proteins contain sorting signals in the form of specific-sequence motifs or conformational epitopes that allow them to be sorted from constitutive secretory proteins by a receptor-mediated mechanism at the level of the TGN (1Gumbiner B. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1982; 28: 51-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The third model combines features of the first two mechanisms and assumes that there is initial interaction of the regulated secretory protein with a receptor, which then triggers the formation of an aggregate that is packaged into secretion granules. Several lines of evidence suggest that the propeptide is recognized by the sorting apparatus and that the structural domains that serve as recognition signals are dominant, since fusion of a constitutively secreted protein to a hormone (e.g. GH) targets the hybrid protein to the RSP and deletion of sorting signal domains results in mistargeting to the CSP (16Creemers J.W.M.

In the case of POMC, structure-function and molecular modeling studies have identified a sorting signal motif in the NH2-terminal segment made up of a disulfide bond constrained amphipathic hairpin loop that binds to a sorting receptor identified as membrane-associated CPE (Fig. 1) (21Cool D.R. Fenger M. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8723-8729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Zhang C-F Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling has revealed a similar putative sorting motif in two other precursors, proenkephalin and proinsulin (25Zhang C-F Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutation of the binding site on CPE or in vitro antisense depletion of CPE or genetic obliteration of CPE in the CPEfat mouse leads to missorting of POMC, proenkephalin, and proinsulin (25Zhang C-F Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Normant E. Loh Y.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Shen F.S Loh Y.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5314-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Not all secretory proteins, however, are recognized for sorting by CPE. For instance, chromogranin A, which possesses a RSP sorting domain similar to that in POMC, does not use CPE as a sorting receptor, suggesting the existence of other sorting receptors (26Normant E. Loh Y.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PSST is another well characterized precursor that has been suggested to harbor a sorting signal (18Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Sevarino K.A. Stork P. Ventimiglia R. Mandel G. Goodman R.H.

Mammalian PSST is processed post-translationally at COOH-terminal dibasic and monobasic sites to yield SST-14 and SST-28, respectively (30Patel Y.C. O'Neil W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 745-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Galanopoulou A.S. Kent G. Rabbani S.N. Seidah N.G. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6041-6049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cleavage at an unknown site at the NH2-terminal region has been implicated in generating the decapeptide PSST-(1–10) without any known biological activity (32Benoit R. Ling N. Esch F. Science. 1987; 238: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PSST-(1–10) sequence is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution (33Benoit R. Esch F. Bennett H.P.J. Ling N. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Mufson E.J. Metabolism. 1990; 39: 22-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and deletion of this region results in missorting of the mutant precursor (28Sevarino K.A. Stork P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18507-18513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A comparison of the amino acid sequence and secondary structure of the PSST NH2-terminal segment with that of 14 other prohormones that have been shown experimentally to be sorted to secretory vesicles in AtT-20 cells has identified a common motif consisting of a degenerate amphipathic α-helix (34Kizer J.S. Tropsha A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This consensus sorting sequence in the case of PSST lies within residues 3–15 and differs from the disulfide bond containing hairpin loop structure in POMC, proenkephalin, and proinsulin (Fig.1). In the present study, we have analyzed the PSST-(3–15) segment as a sorting signal by alanine scanning and deletional mutagenesis. We show that Leu7 and Leu11, which form part of a contiguous hydrophobic patch on the surface of the α-helix, are critical for sorting function and that COOH-terminal processing of PSST to SST-14 and SST-28 can occur constitutively but is relatively inefficient in the absence of correct precursor targeting to the RSP. Synthetic peptides were obtained as follows. SST-14 and SST-28 were from Bachem (Marina del Rey, CA); Tyr0 SST-14 was from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmonte, CA); acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Fisher; heptafluorobutyric acid was obtained from Pierce; pepstatin-A, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Forskolin (FSK) was purchased from Calbiochem; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Ser-X-tend was obtained from Irvine Scientific (Santa Anna, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from various suppliers. cDNA for wild type rat prepro-SST was constructed in the expression vector pTEJ8. Using rat prepro-SST as template, a series of mutants were created by the PCR overlap extension technique (35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2): (i) alanine scanning mutagenesis substituting Ala for each of the 13 residues from Ser3 to Leu15 in PSST; (ii) NH2-terminal deletion mutant deleting residues 3–15 of PSST (ΔNPSST); and (iii) insertional mutants substituting Lys13 with KR or RTKR. To construct the mutants, two fragments were created separately, which included a 5′ fragment containing the desired mutation using primer A and a reverse primer and a 3′ fragment using primer B and a forward primer where the forward primer and reverse primers are mirror images of each other. The fragments were then ligated in a third PCR to generate the full-length mutant PPSST cDNA. For example, to create Ser3 → Ala, primers A and 2 were used to synthesize the 5′ fragment of PPSST, and primers B and 1 were used to generate the 3′ fragment. Primer A (5′-ATT CATA AGC TTG CCG CCA CCA TGC TGT CCT GCC GT-3′ (forward)) was designed to contain HindIII endonuclease restriction site, Kozak consensus sequence, and initiation codon.

PCR was carried out with 50 ng of PPSST cDNA in 100 µl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 µm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 6% Me2SO, and 2 units ofPfu (Stratagene) using the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 80 s, anealing at 59 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s for 25 cycles followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the amplified bands were electroeluted and purified. Fragments B-1 and A-2 were then fused in a ligation reaction using flanking primer pair A and B. After PCR ligation, the products were digested to completion withEcoRI and HindIII, and the purified fragments were subcloned into HindIII–EcoRI multiple cloning sites of pTEJ8. All recombinant plasmid constructions were verified by sequencing of double-stranded DNA (University Core DNA Service, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada), and at least two independent clones of each mutant were independently transfected. AtT-20 mouse anterior pituitary cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with Ser-X-tend in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 100 × 20-mm Petri dishes and transfected at 50% confluency with 3–5 µg of the appropriate plasmid construct by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) and stable G418 (0.861 mg/ml)-resistant nonclonally selected cells were propagated for study. Stably transfected AtT-20 cells were cultured in 35-mm diameter six-well plastic Petri dishes and grown to 80–90% confluency, after which they were prepared for studies of basal and stimulated secretion of immunoreactive SST-14 (SST-14 LI). Following removal of the feeding medium, groups of five wells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1% bovine serum albumin containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and pepstatin-A (20 µg/ml each). To study regulated secretion, cells were incubated with 20 µm FSK or 10−7m TPA for 4 h. Media were then harvested and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove detached cells, and the supernatant was acidified to pH 4.8 with 1 macetic acid and stored at −20 °C pending radioimmunoassay (RIA) analysis of SST-14 LI. Attached cells were extracted by scraping into 1m acetic acid containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and pepstatin-A (20 µg/ml each) on ice. The cell suspension was further extracted by sonication followed by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was stored at −20 °C for RIA and HPLC analysis. Pooled acidified secretion media and cell extracts were diluted 1:7 with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and concentrated using Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. The adsorbed peptides were analyzed by HPLC on a C18 µBondapak reverse phase column using a Waters HPLC system as previously described (30Patel Y.C. O'Neil W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 745-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Galanopoulou A.S. Kent G. Rabbani S.N. Seidah N.G. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6041-6049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was eluted at room temperature (21 °C) at 1 ml/min with 12–55% acetonitrile and a 0.2% heptafluorobutyric acid gradient over 150 min. The column effluent was monitored for UV absorbance at 214 and 280 nm. Fractions were spiked with 10 µl of 10% bovine serum albumin, and stored at −20 °C until further use. 30–100-µl aliquots from each fraction were rotary-evaporated with a Speedvac and assayed for SST-14 LI by RIA. RIA for SST-14 LI was performed using a rabbit anti-SST antibody (R149), [125I]Tyr0SST-14 radioligand, synthetic SST-14 standards, and a bovine serum albumin-coated charcoal separation method (30Patel Y.C. O'Neil W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 745-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Galanopoulou A.S. Kent G. Rabbani S.N. Seidah N.G. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6041-6049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody R149 is directed against the central segment of SST-14 and detects SST-14 as well as the molecular forms extended at the amino terminus of the peptide such as SST-28 and PSST. The cellular localization of SST-14 LI in AtT-20 cells expressing wild type and mutant PSST forms was characterized by fluorescence immunocytochemistry (36Kumar U. Sasi S. Suresh S. Patel A. Thangaraju M. Metrakos P. Patel S.C. Patel Y.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Stably transfected AtT-20 cells were plated at 1.25 × 105cells/well in 24-well plates coated with 50 mg/ml polyornithine. On day 3 at ∼60–70% confluency, cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1% PBS) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in (0.1% PBS) for 5 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS and incubated with R149 anti-SST-14 antibody (diluted 1:1000) for 8–12 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 90 min at 20 °C with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200). For staining the Golgi apparatus, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for 5 h with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to fluoroscein (1:1000). Finally, cells were washed twice with PBS, mounted with immunofluor and viewed under a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Images were obtained as single optical sections taken through the middle of cells and averaged over 32 scans/frame. The secondary structure of rPSST (residues Ala1–Cys92) was predicted with the [email protected] consensus secondary structure prediction algorithm (37Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) using 11 secondary structure prediction methods: SOPM, SOPMA, HNN, DPM, DSC, GOR-I, GOR-III, GOR-IV, PHD, PREDATOR, and SIMPA96. A structural model of the predicted α-helical region Pro5–Thr19 was constructed from standard geometries using the BIOPOLYMER module in SYBYL 6.6 molecular modeling software (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). NH2 and COOH termini were blocked with acetyl and methylamino groups, respectively. Structural refinement was carried out by energy minimization using an AMBER 4.1 all-atom force field (38Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bailey C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T.

Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnet's significance test. Significance was indicated by a p value of < 0.05. AtT-20 cells expressing WT PSST released total SST-14 LI at a low basal rate of 0.54 ± 0.08 ng/ml/4 h representing 8.3% of total cell content (Fig. 3 A). FSK stimulated SST-14 LI secretion 1.9-fold, whereas TPA demonstrated a 3.3-fold stimulation of SST-14 LI release. By immunocytochemistry, SST-14 LI displayed punctate localization in vesicular structures in both the main cell body throughout the cytoplasm as well as in cell processes (Fig. 4, A–C). These results provide both morphological and functional evidence that PSST is properly sorted to the RSP in AtT-20 cells displaying low basal secretion and positive response to secretagogue stimulation, thereby making these cells an appropriate model for studying PSST sorting to the RSP.Figure 4Immunofluorescence localization of SST-14 LI in AtT-20 cells expressing WT PPSST (A–C) and PPSST mutants Lys13 to KR (D–F), Leu7 to Ala (G–I), and Lys13to Ala (J–L). The left panels show SST-14 LI identified by Cy3 red fluorescence. The middle panels show wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) localized as green fluorescence in the Golgi, and the right panels show the cellular colocalization. Note the presence of SST-14 LI throughout the cytoplasm in A–C andJ–L. SST-14 LI is absent in cytoplasmic granules inD–F and G–I and colocalized with WGA in the Golgi region. Similar localization was seen in the case of the ΔPSST-(3–15) and Leu13 to Ala mutants (not shown).Scale bar, 25 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the sorting function of the NH2-terminal domain of PSST, we created a deletion mutant in which the Ser3 to Leu15 residues were removed. In addition, two other mutants were created, replacing the putative monobasic Lys13processing site with RTKR (a classic furin motif) or the dibasic motif KR to enhance NH2-terminal PSST cleavage endogenously by the prohormone convertase furin or PC1/PC2, respectively. AtT-20 cells stably expressing the ΔNPSST mutant released SST-14 LI at a high basal rate (7.1 ± 0.33 ng/ml/4 h) representing ∼50% of total cell content (Fig. 3 B). Release was unresponsive to FSK or TPA stimulation during a 4-h incubation (7.12 ± 0.38 and 7.83 ± 0.35 ng/ml SST-14 LI, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained with"

The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors is the largest and most ubiquitous of the receptor mediated processes. We describe here the analysis in real-time of the assembly and disassembly of soluble G protein-coupled receptor-G protein complexes. A fluorometric method was utilized to determine the dissociation of a fluorescent ligand from the receptor solubilized in detergent. The ligand dissociation rate differs between a receptor coupled to a G protein and the receptor alone. By observing the sensitivity of the dissociation of a fluorescent ligand to the presence of guanine nucleotide, we have shown a time- and concentration-dependent reconstitution of theN-formyl peptide receptor with endogenous G proteins. Furthermore, after the clearing of endogenous G proteins, purified Gα subunits premixed with bovine brain Gβγ subunits were also able to reconstitute with the solubilized receptors. The solubilizedN-formyl peptide receptor and Gαi3 protein interacted with an affinity of ∼10−6m with other α subunits exhibiting lower affinities (Gαi3 > Gαi2 > Gαi1 ≫ Gαo). TheN-formyl peptide receptor-G protein interactions were inhibited by peptides corresponding to the Gαi C-terminal regions, by Gαi mAbs, and by a truncated form of arrestin-3. This system should prove useful for the analysis of the specificity of receptor-G protein interactions, as well as for the elucidation and characterization of receptor molecular assemblies and signal transduction complexes.

A broad variety of physiological processes depend on this family of seven transmembrane proteins, making them prime targets for drug discovery (1Gudermann T. Nurnberg B. Schultz G. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Several complementary approaches are being taken in this therapeutic effort. One approach is to define novel therapeutic agents including both agonists and antagonists for specific receptors, as well as molecules that block interactions between receptors and their G protein transduction partners. In addition, the interactions between ligands and receptors are beginning to be thoroughly mapped through studies incorporating receptor mutagenesis as well as analysis of the binding and activity of ligand analogs (2Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Comparable efforts are being made to describe the molecular mechanisms that influence the specificity of coupling interactions between GPCR and their cognate heterotrimeric G proteins. Several experimental systems for reconstitution provide alternatives for studying receptors and G proteins, such as adding G protein to stripped membranes, pairing receptors and G proteins in phospholipid vesicles (3Cupo J.F. Allen R.A. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and examining solubilized receptor-G protein interactions using gradient centrifugation (4Bommakanti R.K. Dratz E.A. Siemsen D.W. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the interactions between ligand (L), receptor (R), and G protein (G) are described by the ternary complex model (5De L.A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of LRG is required for the activation of the G protein and typically involves the formation of a high affinity receptor, release of GDP, and activation of the G protein through GTP binding (1Gudermann T. Nurnberg B. Schultz G. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Extended ternary complex models have been developed to describe the transition of receptors from inactive to activated states (6Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The assembly kinetics of these systems are not completely understood as the available methods do not provide the time resolution required to evaluate all of the steps in the activation process. Moreover, analysis of receptor-G protein interactions in cells is complicated by the difficulty in elucidating the G protein numbers and concentrations within the microdomains of the receptors and the transient association between receptors and G proteins. To further the understanding of GPCR-mediated processes, we have utilized the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), which couples to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and is expressed predominantly on leukocytes (7Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This receptor recognizes the bacterially generatedN-formyl peptides that act as potent chemoattractants for human phagocytes. The FPR is one of the better characterized receptors in the chemoattractant/chemokine subclass of GPCR (8Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It modulates several cell functions including chemotaxis, superoxide formation, and degranulation, as well as influencing nuclear regulation via activation of MAPK cascades (7Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that the FPR binds preferentially to a Gαi2 protein as this Giisoform is highly expressed in neutrophils, while Gαi3 is expressed at low levels and there is no expression of Gαi1 (9Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Murphy P.M. Eide B. Goldsmith P. Brann M. Gierschik P. Spiegel A. Malech H.L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 221: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A recent report using chimeric proteins containing the FPR fused to Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3, expressed in Sf9 cells, suggested that the FPR couples to each of the Gi isoforms with similar efficiency (11Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, several aspects of this interaction still remain unresolved. We have previously described a number of real-time assays of ligand-receptor interactions using flow cytometry and fluorescence that have been primarily directed toward viable cells or detergent-permeabilized cells (12Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Nolan J.P. Chambers J.D. Sklar L.A. Babcock G. Robinson P. Cytometric Approaches to Cellular Analysis. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 19-46Google Scholar, 14Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies characterized wild type and mutant receptors leading to a model of receptor-G protein coupling for the FPR (13Nolan J.P. Chambers J.D. Sklar L.A. Babcock G. Robinson P. Cytometric Approaches to Cellular Analysis. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 19-46Google Scholar). More recently, we were able to assess the efficiency of solubilization of the FPR using fluorescence methods, and have shown that these receptors were able to reconstitute with G proteins in a non-cellular format (15Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this report we have expanded our investigation of the detergent-solubilized FPR with emphasis on the receptor-G protein interaction. Using reconstitution assays, we demonstrate the ability of the receptor to couple with endogenous G proteins, as well as with exogenous G proteins containing specific Gα subunits. We were able to measure the affinities of the complexes and found that the FPR binds to a G protein heterotrimer containing the Gαi3 subunit with somewhat higher affinity than to heterotrimers containing Gαi2 or Gαi1 proteins. The individual α subunits and the βγ complex alone were unable to induce a change in the dissociation of ligand from the receptor indicating a necessity for the G protein heterotrimer. We were able to inhibit the G protein-receptor interaction with peptides derived from the Gαi subunits as well as with anti-Gαi antibodies. Finally, we have expanded the system to include analysis of GPCR-arrestin interactions. The methods described here provide an approach to study the mechanism of GPCR interactions with G proteins, arrestins, and other potential targets and at the same time provide a platform for identifying and characterizing novel therapeutic agents. The generation of U937 cells transfected with the FPR was previously described (16Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasticware was obtained from VWR Scientific Co. Chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma except where otherwise noted. Cells were grown in tissue culture-treated flasks (Corning) in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, with 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were grown in standard tissue culture incubators at 37 °C with 5% CO2, and passaged from subconfluent cultures every 3–4 days by reseeding at 2 × 105 cells/ml. Purified G protein α subunits Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo (functional, myristoylated, rat recombinant) were purchased from Calbiochem. The bovine brain βγ complex was isolated and purified as previously reported (17Neubig R.R. Connolly M.P. Remmers A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Arrestins were expressed inEscherichia coli (strain BL21) and purified by sequential heparin-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose chromatography essentially as described (18Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents for inhibition of reconstitution include three G protein α subunit blocking peptides composed of the last 10 amino acids of Gαi1,2, Gαi3, and Gαs, and anti-Gα antibodies recognizing the C terminus of Gαi1,2, Gαi3, Gαo, and an internal Gαi3 antibody (Calbiochem). U937 FPR cells were harvested, centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 min, and resuspended in cavitation buffer (10 nm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 600 μg/ml ATP) at a density of 107cells/ml at 4 °C. The cell suspension was placed in a nitrogen bomb and pressurized to 450 psi using N2 gas for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclei and cytoplasmic material were separated by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing the membranes, was washed 2 times by centrifugation at 135,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, then resuspended in HEPES sucrose buffer (200 mmsucrose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7), aliquoted, and stored until use at −80 °C. Membranes were thawed and diluted to 1–2 × 108 membrane cell equivalents/ml (CEQ/ml) in binding buffer (30 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MgCl2). Preparations were maintained at 4 °C throughout the extraction process. Membranes were centrifuged at 135,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 150 μl of binding buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture I and 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem). Preparations were incubated 60 min at 4 °C with agitation. The insoluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 70,000 ×g for 5 min in a Beckman Airfuge. The supernatant, containing the solubilized fraction, was removed and this extract was used for experimentation within 6 h. Membranes (1 × 108cell equivalents) were solubilized and applied to 1 ml of a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient prepared in binding buffer plus 1%n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman) for 14 h and fractionated into 20 × 50-μl fractions. To establish the distribution of receptor, 25 μl of each fraction was incubated with 10 nm formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (fMLFK-FITC, Peninsula Laboratories) for 2 h on ice. Fractions were subjected to spectrofluorometric analysis, as outlined below. Gradients containing 5 μg of bovine serum albumin (4.4 S) and rabbit immunoglobulin (7.7 S) were centrifuged in parallel. These fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie staining. Based on the sedimentation of these standard proteins, the migration of 4 S and 7 S proteins was calculated to peak at fractions 9 and 15, respectively. Purified individual α subunits were mixed in an equimolar ratio with the βγ complex and incubated on ice for 15 min to form the heterotrimeric complex (17Neubig R.R. Connolly M.P. Remmers A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Solubilized FPR (5–10 μl of ∼10 nm receptor in 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside prepared as above), was then incubated with the specific G-protein heterotrimers or with a mixture of bovine brain Gi/Go heterotrimer (Calbiochem) at a concentration of up to 3 μm for up to 2 h on ice in the presence of 10 nm fMLFK-FITC. Blocked samples were incubated with 1 μm formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Phe (fMLFF, CBI) for 15 min prior to the addition of fMLFK-FITC. Samples were prepared in small volumes (typically 15 μl) to maximize receptor concentration. Control samples were prepared in the presence of appropriate buffer(s). The Gα subunit buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The Gβγ buffer contained 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% sodium cholate, pH 8.0, The arrestin buffer contained 10 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μm chymostatin, pH 7.5. Reconstitution incubations were carried out in the presence of 0.8 to 0.85% detergent (final concentration). The activity and concentration of the Gαo subunit was verified using a BODIPY FL GTPγS binding assay titrating the subunit (1 nm to 300 nm) against 50 nmnucleotide and recording the resulting changes in fluorescence on the spectrofluorometer (19McEwen, D. P., Gee, K. R., Kang, H. C., and Neubig, R. R. (2001) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar, 20Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The derived value for the Gαo subunit concentration was consistent with the value reported by the supplier (data not shown). Fluorescence associated with fMLFK-FITC was measured by a SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Inc.) using the photon counting mode in acquisition. The sample holder was fitted with a cylindrical cuvette adapter to permit measurements in stirred volumes of 200 μl using small cylindrical cuvettes (Sienco) and 2 × 5-mm stir bars (Bel-Art). Excitation was fixed at 490 nm, and stray light was reduced with a 490 nm, 10-nm band pass filter (Corion). FITC fluorescence emission was monitored using a 520 nm, 10-nm band pass interference filter (Corion) and a 3–70 orange glass, 500-nm long pass filter (Kopp). Additions to samples during kinetic measurements were performed using 10-μl glass syringes (Hamilton) adding reagents through an injection port on the SLM 8000 above the sample cuvette. Following preparation at 4 °C, samples were brought up to a volume of 200 μl with binding buffer plus 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, equilibrated to 22 °C, and placed into the spectrofluorometer with constant stirring. Data were acquired for 180–210 s in 1-s intervals. Typically, total fluorescence was obtained for the first 20 s, then, an anti-fluorescein antibody was added to the sample. The antibody binds free fMLFK-FITC with high affinity and results in essentially complete quenching of the fluorescence associated with free ligand (14Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the remaining fluorescence represents the receptor-bound. In G protein experiments, GTPγS (100 μm) sensitivity was used to assess the coupling between receptors and G proteins based on characteristic ligand dissociation rates. Experiments were performed using a detergent concentration slightly above the critical micelle concentration. Data were analyzed and graphed using Prism software (Graph Pad Software Inc.). To determine the dissociation characteristics of the receptor preparations, the fluorescence over time in blocked control samples was subtracted point by point from the fluorescence over time of ligand binding samples as described previously (14Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were then normalized and the relative fluorescence was fit by nonlinear regression using single (Equation 1) or double (Equation 2) exponential decay equations. I=A*e(−kt)+plateauEquation 1 I=A1*e(−k1t)+A2*e(−k2t)+plateauEquation 2 Where I = fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units, kx is the off rate of the receptor state in s−1, t is time in seconds, plateau is the fluorescence when all peptide has dissociated and Axis the fraction of receptor in the state with the rate ofkx. Rates are given as mean ± S.E. Membrane preparations were solubilized in detergent as outlined above. The sample was then incubated with 20 μl of anti-Gαi1,2,3antibody (Calbiochem) for 45 min on ice. To remove antibody-substrate conjugates, 100 μg of Protein A-agarose was added to the sample. After a 30-min incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 30 s and the supernatant was removed. The process was then repeated. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman) with a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Owl Scientific). Membranes were blotted with antibody (rabbit) against either Gαi1,2,3 or βγ (Calbiochem) followed by an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma). The blots were developed using ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and imaged using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Receptor-G protein interactions have been characterized in intact and permeabilized cells, membranes, phospholipid vesicles, and in detergent using gradients (3Cupo J.F. Allen R.A. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,21Klotz K.N. Krotec K.L. Gripentrog J. Jesaitis A.J. J.

We have extended the use of detergent-solubilized FPR and G proteins, adding fluorescence detection, to study receptor-G protein complexes in real-time. We have taken advantage of the fact that the ligand dissociation rate of the LR complex of the FPR (in the absence of G protein or in the presence of GTPγS) is many times faster than ligand dissociation from LRG (12Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Posner R.G. Fay S.P. Domalewski M.D. Sklar L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sklar L.A. Mueller H. Omann G. Oades Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8483-8486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the G protein imparts a higher affinity for ligand to the receptor. When GTP is not available, the G protein remains bound to the FPR. The addition of GTP, or its non-hydrolyzable analog GTPγS, putatively induces the dissociation of G protein from the receptor and results in a decrease in the affinity of the ligand, increasing its dissociation rate. The change in the ligand dissociation rate is likely to represent a switch from the slowly dissociating LRG to the rapidly dissociating LR as the activated G protein uncouples from the FPR. The assay is based upon a fluorescein-conjugated ligand used along with an anti-fluorescein antibody that rapidly quenches the fluorescein of the free ligand upon binding. The antibody is able to interact only with the fluorescein on the free ligand, as FPR-ligand complexes sterically inhibit the antibody from binding the fluorescein (14Sklar L.A. Finney D.A. Oades Z.G. Jesaitis A.J. Painter R.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way we were able to determine the quantity of FPR-bound ligand (Fig. 1) immediately following the addition of the anti-fluorescein antibody. We were also able to follow the ligand dissociation kinetics as the excess antibody further quenches ligand released from the receptor. These methods were based on assays that have been fully characterized using permeablized whole cells (12Fay S.P. Posner R.G. Swann W.N. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5066-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Nolan J.P. Chambers J.D. Sklar L.A. Babcock G. Robinson P. Cytometric Approaches to Cellular Analysis.

Chem. 1984; 259: 5661-5669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation data was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data were fit to one or two rates, the slow rate apparently representing L dissociation from RG and the fast rate apparently representing L dissociation from R. The human FPR was previously stably transfected into the undifferentiated human myeloid cell-line, U937 (16Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The U937 cells expressing the wild type FPR react specifically to formylated peptides with calcium and chemotactic responses (26Kew R.R. Peng T. DiMartino S.J. Madhavan D. Weinman S.J. Cheng D. Prossnitz E.R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 61: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were prepared using N2 cavitation and the work presented is data from both intact membranes or membranes that have been solubilized with 1.0% detergent solution. The extent of ligand binding to the FPR is similar for membranes and the solubilized membrane extract (15Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in the membrane samples it appeared that G proteins were either pre-coupled to, or interacted almost immediately with, the receptor after the addition of ligand, but once the membranes were solubilized, no G protein interaction was observed over the same time frame (Fig. 1 A). In earlier studies we demonstrated the ability of the solubilized receptor to interact with an exogenous G protein, if the receptor was incubated in the presence of ligand for 2 h (15Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus it was possible that the solubilized receptor would reconstitute with endogenous G proteins over time if ligand was present. As shown in Fig. 1 B, there was indeed a time dependence to the interaction. Additionally, when assays were prepared in larger volumes, that diluted the concentration of both receptor and G protein, reconstitution was not observed (data not shown). This dependence on receptor and G protein concentration in solution suggests that while within the membranes, the receptor-G protein interactions take place rapidly in two dimensions, the solubilized proteins exist in three dimensions requiring extra time for the proteins to associate. To confirm that our receptor preparations were solubilized in the presence of 1% detergent (n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside), a sucrose velocity sedimentation assay was performed. This assay determines the extent of solubilization and complex formation of proteins. Briefly, the solubilized receptor fraction is layered onto a 5–20% sucrose gradient. Following centrifugation, the gradients are fractionated, and the position of the FPR within the gradient was determined by spectrofluorometric analysis. The FPR was found in fractions 8–10, sedimenting as a 4 S species, as expected for a monodisperse receptor (Fig.2). Also, this further confirmed that the solubilized FPR was not initially coupled to a G protein. In order to generate a system in which the affinities of specific exogenous G protein subunits could be determined for the FPR, we first needed to remove the endogenous G protein from our solubilized receptor solution. This was accomplished by incubating the sample with an anti-Gαi1,2,3 antibody then adding protein A-agarose to clear the antibody-substrate conjugates. Our solubilized receptor sample, when treated in this manner, lost all sensitivity to GTPγS and the non-linear regression fit of the data indicated only a single exponential decay corresponding to LR. This suggested that the endogenous G proteins had indeed been removed from the sample (Fig. 3 A). Western blot analysis of the sample prior to, and after antibody treatment, confirmed that this procedure effectively cleared the endogenous Gi proteins from the system. It appeared that the Gi proteins were present in the heterotrimeric form as the anti-Gαi antibody pulled down both the α subunits and the βγ complex (Fig. 3 B). A receptor preparation treated in this way would be appropriate for the analysis of specific receptor-G protein interactions. It has been shown that the FPR interacts with pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins in neutrophils and U937 cells (9Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Murphy P.M. Eide B. Goldsmith P. Brann M. Gierschik P. Spiegel A. Malech H.L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 221: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The predominantly expressed Gi protein in neutrophils has a Gαi2 subunit. Thus it has been assumed that the FPR preferentially binds to the Gαi2 proteins. Until now it has been difficult to directly assess the affinity between G proteins and receptors. We have previously demonstrated the ability of solubilized receptors to reconstitute with a bovine brain G protein mixture with an ED50 of ∼10−6m under conditions where the ligand and receptor concentrations are ∼10 nm(15Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expanding this study, we examined this interaction using specific, purified G protein α subunits (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo). The individual α subunits were first mixed in an equal molar ratio with bovine brain βγ to form a G protein heterotrimeric complex (17Neubig R.R. Connolly M.P. Remmers A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Solubilized receptor, that had been depleted of endogenous G protein, was incubated with the individually prepared G protein heterotrimers in the presence of fluorescein-conjugated ligand for 2 h. The resulting plots, as seen in Fig. 4,A-D, demonstrate the preference of the FPR for the Gαi subunits as the Gαo protein does not appear to induce the high ligand affinity state of the receptor. Non-linear regression of the first phase (t = 20–50 s) of the Gαi curves (*) fit to a double exponential (after subtraction of the free component), indicating that two different rates were present. The slower rate was 0.0065 ± 0.0020 s−1, representing ligand dissociation from RG (high affinity state), and t"
https://openalex.org/W1969892750,"We have examined the dependence of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) for protection against glutamate toxicity. Under co-culture conditions, rat CGNs require astrocytes to protect against glutamate. The CGNs become more sensitive to glutamate toxicity in co-culture than when grown in cultures with only low numbers of astrocytes. If the protection of the astroyctes was withdrawn or blocked, this sensitivity led to neuronal death. Differing changes in NMDA receptor subunit subtype composition were noted depending on the conditions in which the CGNs were grown. Suppression of individual NMDA subunit subtypes by oligonucleotide knockdown resulted in inhibition of toxicity. This result implies that astrocytes regulate the expression of NMDA receptor subunit subtypes which influence neuronal sensitivity to glutamate toxicity.

The way in which astrocytes protect neurons from various insults is under continued investigation. In the cerebellum where glutamate is a major neurotransmitter (1Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), the astrocyte population provides effective protection against the excitotoxicity of glutamate (2McLennan H. Brain Res. 1976; 115: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Astrocytes clear the glutamate released by neurons via active uptake through glutamate-transporting proteins such as GLAST and GLT-1 (3Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2141) Google Scholar). Without rapid clearance there is the possibility that glutamate will have a toxic effect mediated through binding to NMDA receptors (7Choi D.W. Koh J.-Y. Peters S. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 185-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of astrocytes in neuron-rich cultures has been shown to reduce the toxic potency of glutamate (8Rosenberg P.A. Amin S. Leitner M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 56-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ye Z.-C. Sontheimer H. Glia. 1998; 22: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When glutamate is not cleared, levels of glutamate can easily rise activating NMDA receptors, causing increased calcium entry, internal oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventually apoptosis (7Choi D.W. Koh J.-Y. Peters S. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 185-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bondy S.L.C. Lee D.K. Brain Res. 1993; 610: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 11Speliotes E.K.

Therefore, understanding what regulates glutamate uptake by astrocytes is essential. There is now strong evidence that factors from neurons alter the level of expression of the astrocyte glutamate transporters (14Swanson R.A. Liu J. Miller J.W. Rothstein J.D. Farrel K. Stein B.A. Longuemare M.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 932-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gegelashvili G. Danbolt N.C. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2612-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Levy L.M. Lehre K.P. Walaas S.I. Storm-Mathisen J. Danbolt N.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2036-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This can result in an increased clearance of glutamate via these transporters (17Brown D.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Brown D.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, factors released by neurons signal to astrocytes the presence of neurons and induce an alteration of astrocyte protein expression that results in increased protection of neurons by astrocytes against glutamate toxicity. We have identified vasoactive intestinal peptide as one such factor released by neurons (18Brown D.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been shown that substances such as vasoactive intestinal peptide not only alter the effectiveness of glutamate transport by astrocytes but stimulate the release of protective factors, which also help neurons resist the excitotoxicity of substances such as glutamate and NMDA (19Gottschall P.E. Tatsuno I Arimura A. Brain Res. 1994; 637: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In understanding the mechanism by which glutamate toxicity is prevented in the normal brain, there is clearly a need to understand not just how glutamate uptake by astrocytes is altered by the presence of neurons but also how neuronal sensitivity to glutamate is regulated by the presence of astrocytes other than their removal of glutamate by active uptake. Previous studies have shown that mouse cerebellar neurons become dependent on astrocytes for protection from glutamate toxicity (17Brown D.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cerebellar neurons co-cultured with astrocytes show an increased sensitivity to the toxicity of glutamate as compared with cerebellar neurons not co-cultured. This effect is not dependent on the regional origin of the astrocytes used for co-culture (17Brown D.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Region-specific effects of astrocytes have been suggested to be contact-mediated (22Westergaard N. Sonnewald U. Unsgård G. Peng L. Hertz L. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 62: 1727-1733Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the changes to glutamate sensitivity were related to diffusable factors, some of which have been defined (18Brown D.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the presence of astrocytes, this increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of glutamate is normally not noticeable because of the survival promoting effects of astrocytes such as clearance of glutamate and release of protective factors. Increased sensitivity to glutamate toxicity is only of consequence if the protectiveness of astrocytes is compromised. We have found several ways this compromise can be caused, which lead to glutamate-induced neuronal death: 1) physical removal of astrocytes, 2) addition of substances that inhibit astrocytic glutamate uptake (21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), 3) substances that activate astrocytes (e.g. transforming growth factor-β) (17Brown D.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or 4) inactivation of protective factors such as interleukin-6 (21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This increased sensitivity to glutamate is induced in neurons by a factor released by astrocytes. Neurons treated with conditioned medium (NAM)1 from astrocytes exposed to medium from neuronal cultures showed decreased survival. This decreased survival was a result of glutamate toxicity, but it was not caused by increased glutamate concentration (21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, some additional factor released by astrocytes into NAM makes neurons more sensitive to glutamate toxicity. Release of this factor is enhanced by the presence of neurons themselves or by conditioned medium from neurons (17Brown D.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Clearly, identification of this factor and its mechanism of action are of great importance because of their possible role in regulating neuronal sensitivity to excitotoxic death. In the present report, we have examined regulation of neuronal (CGN) sensitivity to glutamate. We have used the rat system and confirmed that this displays the same characteristics as the mouse system. We have identified changes in NMDA receptors subunit subtype composition that parallel increased sensitivity to glutamate toxicity. Oligonucleotide knockdown of expression of these subunit subtypes inhibits glutamate toxicity markedly. Oligonucleotide therapy based on these observations may provide an effective way to combat excitotoxic neuron death in a variety of diseases. Unless specified chemicals and pharmacological agents were from Sigma. The rats used were Wistar from Harlan.l-trans-Pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) was from Tocris. Mixed glial cultures were prepared from dissociating cerebral cortices of newborn rats. 4–5 cortices were trypsinized in 0.05% trypsin (Sigma) and plated in a 75-cm2 culture flask (Falcon) in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 1% antibiotic solution (penicillin/streptomycin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 14 days until glial cultures were confluent. Astrocytes were isolated and characterized following standard methods as described previously (23Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A Glia. 1996; 18: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Microglia were dislodged into the medium and discarded. Type 1 astrocytes were purified by taking the remaining adhesive cells and trypsinizing. The cells were preplated for 30 min to remove contaminating microglia. Astrocytes remaining in the medium were then collected and plated for 2 h at 104 cells/well into 24-well trays, after which time the medium was replaced to remove less adhesive contaminating cells. Purified astrocytes were maintained under the conditions described for mixed glial cultures. Purity of cultures was determined as described previously (21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A Glia. 1996; 18: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Astrocyte cultures were not used unless purity was close to 100%. Astrocyte cultures were stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako) and detected with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stained cells were examined using a Leitz fluorescence microscope. Conditioned media were prepared from type 1 astrocyte cultures in which the cells had been plated at 104 cells/well. Cells were kept in culture for 24 h before addition of fresh medium. Media were collected after 2 days of exposure of the cells to the medium and other agents, and the conditioned media were used without freezing by direct application to neuronal cultures. NAM was prepared by exposing the astrocytes for 2 days to neuronally conditioned medium. Preparation of cerebellar cells from seven or 8 day old mice (P7–8) was as described previously (21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebella were dissociated in Hanks' salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.5% trypsin and plated at 1–2 × 106 cells/cm2 in 24-well trays (Falcon) coated with poly-d-lysine (50 μg/ml, Sigma). Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 7% CO2. Neuronal cells were stained in cerebellar cell cultures with anti-neuronal nuclei mouse (Chemicon), and detection with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. A neuronal conditioned medium was prepared by taking cerebellar cells that had been in culture for 2 days and exposing them to fresh medium. The conditioned medium was collected after 2 days and applied directly to astrocyte cultures without freezing or storage. This medium was centrifuged to removed cellular particles. For co-culture experiments, cerebellar cells were plated as normal in 24-well trays. Astrocytes and/or microglia were plated in tissue culture inserts (Falcon) with 3.0-μm pores. Pharmacological agents were added to both wells. The volume of the dual well system was maintained at 1 ml. Cerebellar cells were maintained in culture for 1 day before addition of astrocytes. For co-culture experiments, astrocytes were plated into inserts at 104cells/insert. Treatment with agents followed 2 days of co-culture and continued for 4 days afterward. The medium was exchanged 2 days later, and the pharmacological agents re-applied with the fresh medium. Before assaying cerebellar cell survival, the inserts were removed and 3,[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) assays carried out on the cerebellar cells. Fractionation of NAM was performed using Microcon spin concentrators (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NAM was passed sequentially through a series of concentrator filters with molecular mass cut-offs of 3, 10, 30, and 50 kDa. The filtrated was collected, and the retained material was reconstituted to the same volume to pass through the next filter. This produced fractions with solutes approximately <3, 3–10, 10–30, 30–50, and >50 kDa. The assay used for testing the survival of cerebellar cell cultures was as described previously (24Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and was based on the conversion of MTT to a formazan product by respiring cells. MTT was diluted to 200 μm in Hanks' solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and added to cultures for 1 h at 37 °C. The MTT formazan product was released from cells by addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and measured at 570 nm in an Unicam Helios spectrophotometer (ATI Unicam). Relative survival in comparison to untreated controls could then be determined. Total RNA was extracted from cultured astrocytes grown under various conditions using a kit (Qiagen). The cerebellar neurons were either 1) untreated, 2) treated with astrocyte condition medium, 3) exposed to NAM for 2 days, or 4) co-cultured with cerebellar neurons. The RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equivalent amounts of cDNA were used for PCR analysis of NMDA receptor type 1 (NR1) and NMDA receptor type 2 (NR2) subtypes. The method used was as previously described (25Vallano M.L. Lambolez B. Audinat E. Rossier J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 631-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Beaman-Hall C.M. Leahy J.C. Benmansour S. Vallano M.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1993-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the NR1 subtypes NR1a and NR1b were detected using a single PCR reaction using the primers CTCCCACCAGTCCAGCGTCT (forward) and GTCATGTTCAGCATTGCGGC (reverse) where the product for NR1b is the larger of the two produced. For NR2 subtypes NR2a, NR2b, and NR2c products are first amplified with the primers GGGGTTCTGCATCGACATCC (forward) and GACAGCAAAGAAGGCCCACAC (reverse). The product is then digested with one of three restriction enzymes, which can distinguish the different subtypes Bpm1 (NR2a), Bfa1 (NR2b), or ScaI (NR2c). The primers for PCR were generated in house by the PNAC Facility. PCR for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene was carried out using the specific primers (sense, 5′- GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGG -3′; antisense, 5′-CGACGGACACATTGGGGGTAGG -3′) to ensure equivalence of the samples. Additionally, RT-PCR was used to assess the level of 5-lipoxygenase expression. The primers for this analysis were 5′-TGGAACCCCGGCTTCCCTTTGAG-3′ (senses) and 5′-AAAAGCCAGTCGTACTTTGAA-3′. Densitometric analysis of the bands was carried out using NIH Image. Protein was extracted from CGNs and astrocytes by homogenization in an extraction buffer (20 mmTris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). After 20 min of incubation, the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was taken as the extract. A protein determination was carried out using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Sigma) to ensure identical amounts of protein were loaded onto gels. After boiling, extracts were electrophoresed on a 10% acrylamide gel with SDS in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean 2 system. After electrophoresis, the protein was transferred to a nylon membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) with a semidry blotter (Bio-Rad). Detection of specific antigens was carried out following blocking the membrane with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (pH7.4). Primary antibodies included anti-NMDA receptor type 1 (NR1, mouse, Affinity Bioreagents), anti-NMDA receptor type 2 (NR2, mouse, Affinity Bioreagents), anti-synaptophysin (mouse, Sigmna), anti-GFAP (rabbit, Dako), and anti-α-tubulin (mouse, Sigma). Detection was via binding of an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and detection using the ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Antisenses oligonucleotides specific to NR1 and NR2 subtypes were prepared as described by others (27Standaest D.G. Testa C.M. Rudolf G.D. Hollingsworth Z.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 342-352PubMed Google Scholar): NR1a, GGGTCCGCGCTTGTTGTCAT; NR1b, CTGCAGCACCTTCTCTGCCT; NR2a, CATAGCCCAATCTGCCCAT; NR2b, CTTCATCTTCAGCTAGTCGG; NR2c, CCCACCCATGTCACCTGGAG. Oligonucleotides were applied daily at 100 nm to CGN cultures and cultures treated with NAM or astrocyte conditioned medium for 4 days. At the end of that time, a survival assay was carried out and the values compared with those of untreated cultures. For the experiments to be described here, CGN from 7–8-day-old rats were prepared identically but treated four different ways. (a) control cultures were untreated, (b) cultures were co-cultured with astrocytes placed in removable inserts, (c) cultures were exposed to astrocyte conditioned medium (AM), and (d) cultures were exposed to NAM. Unless stated AM and NAM were applied at 20% of the total volume of medium. For some experiments neuronal conditioned medium was used to treat CGN cultures, but as reported previously (21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) this medium had no effect on the survival of CGNs (data not shown). Cultures grown under the four conditions for 4 days were evaluated using immunostaining to detect neurons and astrocytes. All cultures contained neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 1) but treatment of cultures with NAM resulted in an apparent reduction in neuronal number. Using Hoechst staining, it was apparent that only cultures treated with NAM contained cells with fragmented or shrunken nuclei beyond those of controls (control = 6 ± 3, co-culture = 5 ± 3, AM = 3 ± 4, NAM = 17 ± 4, average cells per field). The survival of the cultures was also determined using an MTT assay. Only NAM reduced the survival of CGN cultures after 4 days of treatment (Fig. 2 A). NAM was also applied to CGN cultures at increasing concentrations and was also applied to CGNs co-cultured with astrocytes. NAM but not AM killed CGN cultures in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). Co-culture of CGN cultures with astrocytes inhibited NAM toxicity. NAM toxicity could also be inhibited with MK801 (Fig. 2 A). The glutamate transport inhibitor PDC was applied to CGN cultures alone or co-cultured with astrocytes for 4 days. PDC had no effect on CGNs not co-cultured but was toxic to CGNs co-cultured with astrocytes (Fig.2 C). This effect could also be inhibited with MK801 (data not shown). These results suggest that NAM makes neurons more sensitive to glutamate toxicity and that co-culture protects CGNs from glutamate toxicity by active clearance of glutamate. These results are similar to those from work investigating the toxicity of NAM to mouse CGNs (21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This implies that the system previously investigated in the mouse and this system in the rat are interchangeable. Direct deprivation of CGNs from astrocytic protection against glutamate can be achieved in our co-culture system by growing CGNs with astrocytes in co-culture for 4 days and then withdrawing the astrocytes in the co-culture insert. Although this method does not remove all the astrocytes in the culture, it does diminish them considerably. CGNs treated in this manner were treated with increasing concentrations of glutamate or NMDA. Both glutamate and NMDA were more toxic to CGNs removed from co-culture than to those that had not experienced co-culture or to those maintained in co-culture (Fig.3). These results suggest that co-culture with astrocytes causes specific changes in neurons that make them more sensitive to glutamate and NMDA toxicity. Astrocytes were exposed to conditioned medium from neurons grown in serum-free medium. Serum-free AM was also produced (data not shown). The serum-free AM or NAM were applied to CGNs. Neither medium produced in this manner was toxic to CGNs. However, when NMDA was applied in parallel, it was far more toxic to CGNs exposed to serum-free NAM. This toxicity was fully blocked by MK801, suggesting that the toxicity is mediated through the NMDA receptor (Fig. 3 C). The implication of this result is that NAM alters NMDA receptor response to NMDA or glutamate. Serum-free NAM was produced and heated to 75 °C to denature proteins that might have been secreted by astrocytes. NAM produced this way had no effect on the toxicity of NMDA (Fig.3 C). NAM was also fractionated according to molecular weight of its solutes. These fractions were tested for toxicity on CGNs. The majority of the toxicity was associated with the 10–30-kDa fraction. These results imply that the factor from astrocytes in NAM making CGNs more susceptible to the toxicity of NMDA or glutamate is heat-sensitive and thus likely to be a protein of 10–30 kDa. We investigated whether our four culture conditions alter the expression of NMDA receptors subunits (NR1, NR2) using Western blotting. As controls synaptophysin and tubulin were examined. Co-culture of CGNs with astrocytes did not alter the levels of any of these proteins as compared with untreated CGNs (Fig. 4). Treatment with AM enhanced the expression of synaptophysin dramatically. This suggests that AM greatly enhances the formation of synaptic structures in cultures of CGNs. Furthermore, levels of NR1 and NR2 were also elevated by AM treatment. In comparison tubulin was not significantly elevated (n= 4, Student's t test on densitometric analysis of blots,p > 0.05). Interestingly, NAM did not show the same effect as AM. Although NAM produced a slight elevation of synaptophysin, there was no increase in the level of NR1or NR2. The implication of this is that some factor additionally released by astrocytes into NAM and not into AM suppressed the action of AM or a neuronal factor suppressed astrocytic release of a factor that would otherwise stimulate expression of synaptophysin and NMDA receptors. As it was difficult to ascertain accurately by Western blotting the proportion of each subtype of NR1 and NR2 expressed by CGNs grown under the four conditions, quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of receptor subunit subtypes. The analysis is shown in Fig.5, and the quantitation shown in TableI. Analysis of NR1 again shows an increased total level of NR1 subtypes in AM-treated CGNs with a lesser effect on NAM-treated cultures. Additionally, both co-cultured CGNs and NAM-treated CGNs showed a higher proportion of NR1b subunit than controls of AM-treated cultures. Analysis of NR2 showed little change in total levels of NR2 under any condition. However, NAM-treated astrocytes showed virtually no NR2b, implying a higher level of NR2a and NR2c present in NAM-treated CGNs. Co-culture of CGNs with astrocytes resulted in an increase in the amount of NR2c. The implication is that NAM might have the effect of elevating the percentage of NR2a and NR1b subunits while co-culture elevates NR2c and NR1b.Table ISummary of effects on NMDA receptor subunitsSubunitControlCo-cultureAMNAMTotal NR123 ± 15247 ± 121-150Indicates a significant difference to the control value according to analysis of variance (P< 0.05).

In order to determine if different NMDA subunit subtype composition influences the susceptibility of CGNs to glutamate toxicity in our model, we tested the effect of oligonucleotides specific for each of the five subunit subtypes on NAM toxicity and compared this to the effects of the oligonucleotides on CGNs exposed to AM (Fig.6). The oligonucleotides had no effect on CGN survival in the presence of AM. The anti-NR1b oligonucleotide decreased NAM toxicity the most. The anti-NR2a oligonucleotide decreased NAM toxicity whereas anti-NR2c enhanced toxicity, suggesting that the two subunits have antagonistic roles in terms of sensitivity to NAM toxicity. These results suggest that the changes in some of the NMDA receptor subunit types (NR1b and NR2a) we observed in NAM-treated cultures can be directly related to their increased sensitivity to NAM toxicity. As NAM toxicity is related to either glutamate or NMDA, changes in the subunits caused by NAM may regulate sensitivity to glutamate. We investigated the effect of NAM in terms of inducing cell death through the NMDA receptor. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is known to inhibit toxicity mediated through NMDA receptors. Treatment with NDGA but not indomethacin blocked the toxicity of NAM to CGNs (Fig.7 A). These results suggest that NAM might modify NMDA receptors in a way that initiates synthesis of arachidonic acid when high glutamate is present. To investigate this further, we measured the levels of lipoxygenase in CGNs grown under various conditions. Increased lipoxygenase mRNA was detected using RT-PCR in cultures of CGNs exposed to NAM or co-cultured. The greatest effect was seen with NAM. NAM produced without serum had a weaker effect (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that regulation of the arachidonic acid synthesis pathway is involved in the toxicity induced by NAM. In this article, we have investigated two model systems in parallel. The first, co-culture of astrocytes and CGNs, represents a complete model of the effect of astrocytes on neurons in terms of their interaction to modulate effects of glutamate. The second involves use of conditioned medium from astrocytes, which have themselves been pre-treated with conditioned medium from neurons. The effects of this conditioned medium (NAM) show similarities to that of co-culture in that NAM sensitizes CGNs to the toxicity of glutamate. CGNs withdrawn from co-culture with astrocytes are also more sensitive to glutamate and NMDA toxicity. With this system we were then able to dissect changes in the composition of NMDA receptors that underlie this change in sensitivity to glutamate toxicity. Of particular interest in the current work was the analysis of changes in NR1 and NR2 subtype. This was our main interest in using the rat system for this analysis because of the broader knowledge basis available. In particular it has been suggested that the subunit NR1b is associated with increased sensitivity to glutamate toxicity (28Durand G.M. Gregor P. Zheng X. Bennett M.R.V. Uhu G.R. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9359-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29Nakanishi N. Alex R. Schneider N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8552-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we observed that both co-culture with astrocytes and treatment with NAM resulted in an increase in NR1b. Anti-NR1b oligonucleotide inhibited NAM toxicity, implying that this subunit is involved in the increased toxicity of NAM. As CGNs are protected by astrocytic clearance of glutamate when co-cultured, this would explain why the expression of this subunit in co-cultured CGNs does not result in increased cell death. Despite its role in sensitivity to glutamate, the NR1b isoform has been shown to be necessary for normal regeneration in certain systems such as the retina (30Kreutz M.R. Böckers T.M. Bockmannm J. Seidenbecher C.I. Kracht B. Vorwerk C.K. Weise J. Sabel B.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8278-8291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During normal granule cell development, there is a known progression in the expression of the NR2 subunits subtypes. Early in development, the predominant subtype is NR2b but as development progresses there is a switch to NR2a and then an increase in the levels of NR2c (31Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar, 32Watanabe M. Mishina M. Inoue Y. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 343: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Change in the subunit composition of NMDA receptors alters electrophysiological responses of CGNs (33Farrant M. Feldmeyer D. Takahashi T. Cull-Candy S.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 34Audinat E. Lambolez B. Rossier J. Crepel F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1792-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Co-cultured CGNs demonstrated a NR2 subtype profile more like that of a more mature CGN. The CGNs in NAM showed an increase in type NR2a, but this seemed to be associated with increased sensitivity to NAM whereas NR2c appeared to be protective. Therefore, increased sensitivity to glutamate in the NAM-treated CGNs might represent the inadequacies of a transition phase in development. These findings regarding NMDA subunits are important with relation to treatment to prevent excitotoxic damage in vivo. The suppression of certain subtypes of NMDA subunits using antisense oligonucleotides might represent a possible effective way to diminish damage by glutamate or analogues in many diseases. Alternatively, targeting astrocytes to alter release of substances that modulate NMDA receptor composition might be beneficial. However, it would first be important to determine the precise nature of the molecules released and the mechanisms governing them. These findings also continue our investigation into the interaction of astrocytes and neurons in terms of regulating and preventing glutamate toxicity. We have previously suggested (17Brown D.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Brown D.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that astrocytes release a factor upon stimulation by neurons (i.e. released into NAM) that causes neurons to change their sensitivity to glutamate. We have shown in this work that this change in sensitivity is mediated by changes induced in NMDA receptor composition. We have also observed that astrocyte conditioned medium altered the level of synaptophysin. This effect appears to be inhibited if the astrocytes producing the conditioned medium were first exposed to medium from neurons (see Fig.4). This was possibly because a factor released by neurons inhibited this effect of astrocytes via their conditioned medium. This change in synaptophysin was also not observed in co-culture. The changes in NMDA receptors do not follow this pattern; therefore, what we observe is the stimulation of production of an astrocytic factor rather than an inhibition of one. This factor regulating NMDA receptor composition we tentatively describe as neuron-dependent astrocyte-derived maturation factor (NDADM). NDADM is itself not toxic, as serum-free NAM does not induce cell death but increases CGN sensitivity to NMDA. One of the results of the effect of NDADM or another factor released into NAM is the alteration in the activity of lipoxygenase. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released in response to NMDA receptor stimulation (35Dumuis A. Sebben M. Haynes L. Pin J.-P. Bockaert J. Nature. 1988; 336: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Low levels of arachidonic acid are beneficial to neurons but at high levels are toxic as they generate oxidized metabolites (36Okada S. Saito H. Katsuki H. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found that NDGA, which inhibits lipoxygenase activity, inhibited NAM toxicity, which supports the idea that NAM toxicity is mediated via arachidonic acid as others have found (37Rothman S.M. Yamada K.A. Lancaster N. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our findings provide further evidence that regulation of NMDA receptor subunit expression modulates death mediated through NMDA receptors and that controlling this expression is important for understanding the mechanism of excitotoxicity. The continued emergence of astrocytes as a key regulator of neuronal survival now indicates that, in addition to protecting directly by clearance of glutamate, they also modulate neuronal sensitivity to glutamate. The doorway is now open for the discovery of a new class of modulating factors released by astrocytes, the control of which might be the key to preventing excitotoxicity."

Prototypical NF-κB is a p50-p65 heterodimer that is retained in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells in an inactive form by the inhibitory protein IκBα. In response to various stimuli, IκBα is phosphorylated, rapidly ubiquitinated, and subsequently proteolyzed by a 26 S proteasome complex. The degradation of IκBα unmasks the nuclear localization signal of the NF-κB heterodimer, which then translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to its cognate sequence on DNA and thereby regulates gene transcription. In the brain, NF-κB is constitutively active in many neurons (3Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell.

However, results from cell culture and in vivo studies have demonstrated that activation of NF-κB in neurons represents a highly protective response that promotes cell survival and plasticity (12Barger S.W.

Brain Res. 1996; 40: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Increased NF-κB activity may also occur in response to oxidative stress, perturbed calcium homeostasis, and DNA damage (2Mattson M.P. Culmsee C., Yu, Z. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 24Ginn-Pease M.E. Whisler R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Gius D.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that regulate NF-κB activity in neurons under basal conditions and in response to various physiological and pathological conditions are not known. Changes in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) regulate numerous functions in neurons, including synaptic plasticity and cell survival (27Kennedy M.B. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 417-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Influx through the plasma membrane has long been regarded as the main source of Ca2+-mediated intracellular signals. However, the significance of Ca2+ released from internal stores such as the ER has become increasingly apparent. In neurons, the ER is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and represents a large and releasable pool of calcium. Increased [Ca2+]i can stimulate release of Ca2+ stored in the ER, a phenomenon known as calcium-dependent calcium release that is regulated by the ER-resident IP3- and ryanodine-sensitive receptor calcium channels (29Verkhratsky A. Shmigol A. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling molecule IP3, the ligand for ER IP3 receptors, is generated by activation of phospholipase C and cleavage of phosphoinositol bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and IP3. Calcium regulates the sensitivity of these channels to IP3, increasing the calcium current (28Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Therefore, alterations in [Ca2+]i will affect the activity of the ER IP3 receptor and thus affect cellular events regulated by this receptor. Recent studies have shown that impairment of ER function with accumulation of proteins in the ER and the consequent release of Ca2+ from this organelle stimulates NF-κB DNA-binding activity and NF-κB-dependent gene expression (30Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 31Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because IP3 receptors are highly sensitive to many of the same stimuli that activate NF-κB, and alterations in ER function are associated with increased NF-κB binding and transcription, we examined the relationship between ER IP3 receptors and NF-κB activation. Cerebral cortices were removed from embryonic day 18 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). Cells were dissociated by mild trypsinization and trituration as described previously (32Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and were seeded into 60-mm polyethyleneimine-coated culture dishes containing Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 26 mm NaHCO3, 40 mm glucose, 20 mm KCl, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and 0.001% gentamycin sulfate. After a 3–5-h incubation period to allow for cell attachment, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of neurobasal medium with B27 supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.). Experimental treatments were performed on 7–9-day-old neuronal cultures in which ∼95% of the cells were neurons and the remaining cells were astrocytes. IP3, glutamate, and ryanodine were purchased from Sigma; xestospongin C (XeC) was purchased from Calbiochem; TNF-α was purchased from Pepro-Tech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ); and thapsigargin and BAPTA free acid were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Each reagent was prepared as a 500× or 1000× stock in an appropriate solvent (saline or dimethyl sulfoxide). Total cell extracts were prepared as described (33Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in Totex buffer (350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were collected and stored at −70 °C until taken for assay. The protein content of the extract (supernatant) was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). For EMSA, equal amounts of protein were incubated in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin; 1 μg of poly(dI-dC); 2 μl of buffer containing 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 4 μl of buffer containing 20% Ficoll 400, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; and 20,000–50,000 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) corresponding to either an NF-κB-binding site (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) or a CREB-binding site (5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′). After 20 min at room temperature, reaction products were separated on a 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Competition experiments were performed by incubating extracts with labeled oligonucleotide probe in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled NF-κB, CREB, or AP-1 oligonucleotide. To characterize the NF-κB complexes, supershift assays were performed. Extracts were preincubated for 45 min at room temperature with antibodies recognizing either p50 or p65 subunits of NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The mixtures were further incubated with32P-labeled probe and resolved as described above. Radioactivity of dried gels was detected by exposure to Kodak X-Omat film, and images on the developed film were scanned into a computer using a UMAX 1200s scanner. Densitometry was performed using Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Paint Shop Pro software (Jasc Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was used for preparation of the final figures. Cerebral cortices from adult female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized (20 strokes at 300 rpm) with a Teflon homogenizer in ice-cold buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.32 m sucrose, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, as described previously (34Chen P.Y. Csutora P. Veyna-Burke N.A. Marchase R.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic and microsomal fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation. Briefly, tissue fragments and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to pellet intact mitochondria and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytoplasmic fraction and the microsomal pellet enriched in ER and Golgi membranes. Microsomal extracts (MSEs) were prepared by suspending microsomes in ice-cold buffer (1:100, v/v) and centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Microsomes were then resuspended in buffer (1:2, v/v) and treated with various agents that affect ER calcium release. At the end of the treatment, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and supernatants were used as MSEs. For experiments involving incubation of MSE with the cytoplasmic extract, 3 μl of MSE was added to 10 μl of cytoplasmic extract, and mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoblot analyses were performed using methods described previously (35Glazner G.W. Chan S.L. Lu C. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lanes of a 15% acrylamide gel were loaded with cell homogenate, and proteins (100 μg of protein/lane) were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The nitrocellulose sheet was reacted with primary antibody against grp78 (1:4000 dilution; Stressgen, Inc.), and the primary antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and a chemiluminescence-based detection kit (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). [Ca2+]i in cultured neurons was quantified by fluorescence imaging of the calcium indicator dye fura-2 as described previously (32Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 2 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.), washed with Locke's buffer, and incubated for 40 min prior to imaging. For measurements of the intraluminal Ca2+ concentration, microsomes were incubated for 30 min in the presence of fura-FF acetoxymethyl ester. Cells and microsomes were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (40× oil immersion objective) coupled to an Attofluor imaging system. [Ca2+]iin 12–20 neuronal cell bodies or four to six microsomal clusters per microscope field was monitored prior to and after exposure of cells to glutamate. The possible involvement of ER pools of calcium regulated by IP3 receptors in controlling basal levels of NF-κB activation was investigated using XeC, a membrane-permeable blocker of IP3-induced Ca2+ release (36Gafni J.

Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Conversely, to release the total pool of ER luminal calcium, we used thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the ER Ca2+-ATPase (39Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar, 40Davidson G.A. Varhol R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11731-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cultured primary cortical neurons were treated with 1 μmXeC, 100 nm thapsigargin, or vehicle for 6 h, and protein extracts were analyzed for NF-κB DNA-binding activity. XeC caused a significant decrease in the basal levels of activated NF-κB relative to control levels (Fig. 1,a and b). The decrease in NF-κB activation was not due to interference of XeC with the assay used to detect NF-κB activity as determined by addition of XeC to the reaction (data not shown). As previously reported (41Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), treatment with thapsigargin produced a large and significant increase in NF-κB activity (Fig. 1,a and b). To determine if the effects of XeC and thapsigargin were specific for NF-κB, we measured the levels of CREB DNA-binding activity. CREB is a transcription factor thought to play a role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival (42Stevens C.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 769-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Huang E.P. Stevens C.F. Essays Biochem. 1998; 33: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and activation of CREB is thought to be primarily regulated by calcium (44Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). In contrast to their effects on NF-κB activity, XeC and thapsigargin each produced a small increase in CREB binding activity (Fig. 1 a). We next determined whether IP3receptor blockade would alter the thapsigargin-induced activation of NF-κB. XeC was added to the cortical cultures 30 min before thapsigargin, and binding activity was analyzed after 6 h; IP3 receptor blockade inhibited the ability of thapsigargin treatment to activate NF-κB (Fig.2 a).Figure 2Xestospongin C inhibits induction of NF-κB activation. a, shown are the effects of 100 nm thapsigargin in the absence (Tg) or presence (Tg/X) of 1 μm XeC on NF-κB DNA-binding activity. b–d, following treatment with either vehicle or 1 μm XeC for 30 min, cells were incubated with TNF-α, thapsigargin, or glutamate for 6 h; total cell extracts were prepared; and EMSAs were performed using oligonucleotides specific for NF-κB- or CREB-binding sites.b, shown are the effects of 100 ng/ml TNF-α in the absence or presence of XeC (X) on NF-κB and CREB binding activities. c, films from three separate gel-shift assays of cells treated with vehicle (control (C)), 100 ng/ml TNF-α (T), or 1 μm XeC for 30 min prior to TNF-α treatment (T+X) were scanned, and densitometric analyses were performed.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6057-6063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (12Barger S.W. Horster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9328-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether activation of IP3 receptor-mediated calcium channels is necessary for NF-κB DNA-binding activity induced by glutamate and TNF-α. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with vehicle or XeC and were then exposed to 100 ng/ml TNF-α or 20 μm glutamate for 6 h. TNF-α produced a significant increase in NF-κB activity that was completely abolished by pretreatment with XeC (Fig. 2,b and c). This effect was specific for NF-κB because neither TNF-α nor XeC affected the binding activity of CREB (Fig. 2 b). Induction of NF-κB DNA-binding activity was observed with glutamate treatment, and pretreatment with XeC completely abolished the activation of NF-κB by this excitatory neurotransmitter (Fig. 2 d). Cells pretreated with XeC prior to exposure to glutamate demonstrated a level of NF-κB activity lower than that of control neurons exposed to glutamate. Measurement of [Ca2+]i in neurons by imaging of the calcium indicator dye fura-2 showed that XeC treatment resulted in only a small attenuation of the glutamate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Values were as follows: control, 86 ± 14 nm; 1 μm XeC (5-min exposure), 96 ± 24 nm; 20 μm glutamate (peak response), 618 ± 87 nm; and 1 μm XeC plus 20 μm glutamate (peak response), 410 ± 49 nm (values are the means ± S.D. of determinations made in four cultures with measurements made in at least 12 neurons/culture). Our results to this point indicated that ER IP3-sensitive calcium pools can regulate NF-κB activity in neurons. To gain further insight into the mechanism behind this, we used an in vitro cell-free system to separate cytoplasmic pools of inactive NF-κB from the ER, therefore allowing us to study ER-derived signals that might modulate NF-κB activity. Microsomal preparations were isolated as illustrated (Fig. 3 a), and tests were conducted to establish their content of ER. Immunoblot analysis (Fig.3 b) of grp78, an ER-resident chaperone protein, performed on the various fractions demonstrated that the microsomal fraction was highly enriched in this ER marker. Moreover, measurements of the concentration of intramicrosomal calcium and the subsequent reduction in this value with exposure of the microsomes to IP3demonstrated high levels of functional IP3 receptors in this preparation (Fig. 3 c). To determine the identity of the major NF-κB-binding complexes found in the cytoplasmic fraction, supernatants from the 100,000 ×g centrifugation were incubated with anti-p50 antibody, anti-p65 antibody, or a combination of anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies for 45 min. There were two major bands identified in these experiments, bands A and B (Fig. 3 d). Addition of anti-p50 antibody shifted band A in its entirety to a much higher position, called supershift 1, and shifted the lower band to a slightly higher position, called supershift 2. Band A was also greatly diminished in intensity by anti-p50 antibody treatment. Incubation with anti-p65 antibody caused a disappearance of band A, but had no apparent effect on band B. Incubation with both anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies caused a complete shift upward of band A to the supershift 1 position and shifted band B slightly upwards and reduced its intensity. Thus, band A is the p50-p65 heterodimer, and band B contains p50-p50 homodimers. A binding pattern identical to that seen in the cytoplasmic extracts of this study was previously seen in whole cell extracts of cultured rat cortical neurons (47Glazner G.W. Camandola S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Microsomal preparations were treated with thapsigargin and calcium in the absence or presence of XeC for 1 h and centrifuged, and 3 μl of supernatant (MSE) was added to 10 μl of the cytoplasmic fraction. After 1 h at room temperature, samples were examined for NF-κB DNA-binding activity. Significant increases in NF-κB activity were observed following addition of MSE, thus indicating the presence of a microsome-derived NF-κB-stimulating signal (Fig.4, a and b). MSE from thapsigargin-treated microsomes caused a significant enhancement of this binding activity (Fig. 4, a and b). MSE from XeC-treated microsomes did not elevate NF-κB activity, and treatment with XeC reduced by ∼50% the thapsigargin-stimulated NF-κB activity (Fig. 4, a and b). A recent report suggested that NF-κB may localize to the ER (48May W. Bisby M.A. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the NF-κB-stimulating agent released by microsomes was the activated transcription factor itself. To examine this possibility, EMSAs were performed on cytoplasmic fractions, MSEs, and microsomal pellets following treatment with vehicle, thapsigargin, or XeC. Although there was binding activity found in MSE and microsomes, this binding was >10-fold less than that seen in the cytoplasm. Neither thapsigargin nor XeC had any effect on NF-κB DNA-binding activity levels in any of the three fractions tested (Fig.4 c). We then assessed the necessity of the ER in the microsomal preparation for NF-κB activation by treating isolated cytoplasmic extracts from whole adult rat cortices with 100 nm thapsigargin or 1 μm XeC for 1 h at room temperature prior to analysis by EMSA. As shown in Fig.5 a, neither thapsigargin nor XeC directly affected NF-κB activity relative to control levels, thus confirming that the presence of the ER is necessary for the activation of NF-κB. We next asked whether NF-κB could be induced by calcium directly. Aliquots of the cytoplasmic fraction were treated with calcium at concentrations ranging from 1 μmto 10 mm for 1 h, followed by analysis of NF-κB binding by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 5 b, calcium did not affect NF-κB DNA-binding activity at any concentration tested. These same extracts were analyzed for CREB binding activity; calcium greatly enhanced CREB binding, which likely results from stimulation of calcium-activated kinases (49Deisseroth K. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). These data suggest that although the elevation of calcium in the cytoplasm by itself is able to induce CREB, it is not sufficient to cause NF-κB activation. Conversely, chelation of calcium did not produce a decline in NF-κB DNA-binding activity. Aliquots of the cytoplasmic fraction were treated for 1 h with 10 μm calcium, a 10 μm concentration of the calcium chelator BAPTA free acid, or a combination of the two. As shown in Fig. 5 c, BAPTA alone or in combination with calcium had no effect on the levels of NF-κB activity present in the untreated cytoplasm. We next treated microsomes with thap"

The enzymes involved in the production of the precursors of carbamyl phosphate and nitrogen assimilation, glutamine synthetase and nitrate reductase, were also investigated, and it appears that these two enzymes are present in the bacteria. carbamyl-phosphate synthetase glutamine-dependent CPSase aspartate transcarbamylase dihydroorotase carbamyl-phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamylase-dihydroorotase glutamine synthetase nitrate reductase dihydroorotate dehydrogenase orotate phosphoribosyltransferase CTP synthetase cytidine deaminase 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol The environment of deep-sea hydrothermal vents is very dynamic, with rapidly changing physical and chemical parameters. Hot water containing high amounts of dissolved minerals merges from the vent and mixes with the ambient deep-sea water, generating an extreme environment in terms of hydrostatic pressure, high temperature, and chemical toxicity. In addition, this environment totally lacks photosynthesis for animal nutrition; and yet, in these hostile ecosystems, dense communities of microorganisms and animals are found (1Tunnicliffe V. Oceanogr. Mar. Biol. Annu. Rev. 1991; 29: 319-407Google Scholar, 2Tunnicliffe V. Am. Sci. 1992; 80: 334-349Google Scholar). Riftia pachyptila is a large tube worm found only in the close vicinity of these deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean (3Jones M.L. Oceanol. Acta. 1988; 8: 69-83Google Scholar). The anatomical organization of R. pachyptila is shown in Fig. 1 (4Jones M.L. Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash. 1981; 93: 1295-1313Google Scholar, 5Jones M.L. Science. 1981; 213: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The plume is the only part of the worm that comes in free contact with the venting waters; it has a large surface area that is highly vascularized and allows an efficient exchange of metabolites between the environment and the animal. The vestimentum is a muscle that the animal uses to position itself in the tube. Within the large sac formed by the body wall and terminated by the opisthosome are two of the major tissues of the worm: one, the coelomic fluid, bathes the other, the trophosome, which is the symbiont-harboring tissue (3Jones M.L. Oceanol. Acta. 1988; 8: 69-83Google Scholar). R. pachyptila does not possess a digestive tract. The trophosome, which represents 15–30% of the animal mass, is densely colonized by a chemoautotrophic endosymbiotic bacterium (6Cavanaugh C.M. Gardiner S.L. Jones M.L. Jannasch H.W. Waterbury J.B. Science. 1981; 213: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 7Felbeck H. Science. 1981; 213: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 8Nelson D.C. Fisher C.R. Karl D.M. The Microbiology of Deep-sea Hydrothermal Vents. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 125-167Google Scholar). This tissue is composed of numerous lobules of ∼0.15-mm diameter that are vascularized by the circulatory system of the worm. The lobules consist of an outer single layer of cells and the bacteriocytes, the cells containing the bacterial symbiont. The bacteria are typically surrounded by a host vacuolar membrane that includes one or more of these bacteria (3Jones M.L. Oceanol. Acta. 1988; 8: 69-83Google Scholar, 9Bosh C. Grassé P. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1984; 299: 371-376Google Scholar,10Bosh C. Grassé P. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1984; 299: 413-419Google Scholar). The trophosome is richly irrigated by small capillaries (2–3-μm diameter), and the maximal diffusion distance from the symbionts to the blood is ∼10 μm (3Jones M.L. Oceanol. Acta. 1988; 8: 69-83Google Scholar, 6Cavanaugh C.M. Gardiner S.L. Jones M.L. Jannasch H.W. Waterbury J.B. Science. 1981; 213: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This organization allows facile metabolic exchanges between the animal and the symbiont (11Arp A.J. Childress J.J. Science. 1981; 213: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Felbeck H. Childress J.J. Oceanol. Acta. 1988; 8: 131-138Google Scholar). The endosymbiotic bacteria and the worm constitute a highly integrated system: the bacteria produce metabolic energy from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and provide organic compounds to the worm; in return, the worm provides the bacteria with CO2, O2, H2S, NH3, and minerals. Thus, this particular nutritional organization involves specific metabolic exchanges between the two organisms. All living organisms rely on two metabolic pathways for the production of pyrimidine nucleotides. The “de novo” pathway allows the complete synthesis of these nucleotides, including the synthesis of the pyrimidine ring starting with bicarbonate, glutamine, and ATP. The “salvage” pathway ensures the production of these nucleotides from the pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotide monophosphates provided by the intracellular degradation of nucleic acids. Carbamyl-phosphate synthetase (CPSase),1 aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), and dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyze the first three steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The organization of these three enzymes differs in different living organisms. In bacteria, all the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes are independent proteins encoded by genes generally dispersed throughout the genome, whereas in mammals, the first three steps of this pathway are catalyzed by a single multifunctional protein named CAD (13Coleman P.F. Suttle D.P. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6379-6385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jones M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 253-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 15Evans D. Hardie D.G. Coggins J.R. Multidomain Proteins: Structure and Evolution. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 283-331Google Scholar). The glutamine-dependent CPSase catalyzes the following reaction (Eq. 1). L-Glutamine+HCO3−+2ATP+H2O⇌NH2COOPO32−+2ADP+Pi+L-glutamateEquation 1 As far as the origin of the CPSase substrates in R. pachyptila is concerned, it has been postulated that carbonic anhydrase plays a significant role in CO2 uptake by converting CO2 to HCO 3−(16Kochevar R.E. Govind N.S. Childress J.J. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotech. 1993; 2: 10-19Google Scholar). The l-glutamine must be synthesized by glutamine synthetase (GSase) from glutamate and ammonia. On the basis of what is known about the general processes of nitrogen assimilation, ammonia may either be obtained from the environment or result from the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by nitrate reductase (NRase) (17Stewart V. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and its reduction to ammonia (18Lee R.W. Robinson J.J. Cavanaugh C.M. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar, 19De Cian M. Regnault M. Lallier F.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 2907-2920PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent reactions in the de novo pathway are catalyzed in sequence by ATCase, DHOase, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODase; a membrane-bound or mitochondrial enzyme), orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase), and orotidylate decarboxylase, which provides UMP. This nucleotide is then further phosphorylated to UTP, which is aminated into CTP by CTP synthetase (CTPSase) (20O'Donovan G.A. Neuhard J. Bacteriol. Rev. 1970; 34: 278-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The salvage pathway involves a series of enzymes able to phosphorylate nucleosides and nucleoside monophosphates such as cytidine-uridine kinase and UMP and CMP kinases, enzymes catalyzing the transfer of ribose phosphate such as uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, and enzymes converting one nucleoside into another such as cytidine deaminase (CDase) (20O'Donovan G.A. Neuhard J. Bacteriol. Rev. 1970; 34: 278-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously reported results showed that CPSase and ATCase, the two first enzymes of the de novo pathway, are present only in the trophosome (21Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here we provide more information about the distribution of the enzymes of the de novo and salvage pathways along with information about the enzymes providing the substrates for CPSase, GSase, and NRase. [2-14C]cytidine (50.9 mCi/mmol), and [2-14C]uridine (56 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Sigma. l-[14C]Aspartate (224.8 mCi/mmol), sodium [14C]bicarbonate (55.0 mCi/mmol), [carboxyl-14C]orotic acid (0.05 mCi/mmol), and [5,6-3H]uridine 5′-triphosphate (14.3 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]Uracil (150 mCi/mmol) were purchased from the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France). Samples of the deep-sea tube worm were collected in the East Pacific volcanic range at a depth of 2600 m using the submersible “Nautile” during the campaign HOPE 99. To avoid interference with the subsequent enzyme tests, the specimens were immediately bled and dissected on board, and each isolated organ was frozen in liquid nitrogen as previously described (21Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After collecting and bleeding the animal, the bacterial symbiont was immediately purified by the method proposed by Distel and Felbeck (22Distel D.L. Felbeck H. Mar. Biol. 1987; 96: 97-106Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) under the conditions previously described (21Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Protein extracts from the organs were freshly prepared before the enzyme assays. Frozen tissue (∼2 g) was suspended in 6 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mml-dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 4 μm sodium cacodylate), and the following protease inhibitors were added: 30 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml EDTA, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The mixture was homogenized in a Potter homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was further disrupted by sonication three times for 60 s each with a Biosonik III sonicator at 20 kilocycles/s. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was used for enzyme assays. The activity of CPSase was determined by the radioactive method (23Robin J.P. Penverne B. Hervé G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) under the standard conditions described previously by Simon et al. (21Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The ATCase activity was measured by the radioactive method (24Perbal B. Hervé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 511-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) usingl-[14C]aspartate. The standard conditions were 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mml-[14C]aspartate (specific activity of 0.3 mCi/mmol), and 10 mm carbamyl phosphate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The DHOase activity was measured by an assay adapted from Sander et al. (25Sander E.G. Wright L.D. McCormick D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3628-3630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein extract (50 μl) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 30 mmcarbamyl aspartate in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at a final volume of 1 ml. After incubation, 66 μl of 4 mHClO4 was added to the tubes, which were immersed in an ice bath. The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The dihydroorotic acid produced during this incubation was determined after the addition of 1 ml of 1 m NaOH to 1 ml of the extract. The absorbance at 240 nm was recorded, and the data were standardized with reference to authentic dihydroorotate samples. The DHODase activity was determined by an adaptation of the method described by Miller (26Miller R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The assay mixture was prepared with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium dihydroorotate, 7.5 mm KCN, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μm dichlorophenol-indophenol, 20 μm ubiquinone-30, and 50–100 μl of extract (0.5–1.5 mg of protein). The final volume was adjusted to 2 ml with distilled water. Control cuvettes were prepared with 2 ml of the same mixture without the addition of dihydroorotate. This assay was performed in the presence of orotidylate decarboxylase by the method described by Fox (27Fox R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 41: 578-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in a scintillation vial containing an Eppendorf tube with 1 ml of hyamine hydroxide (ICN) for the absorption of 14CO2release from [carboxyl-14C]orotate. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm [carboxyl-14C]orotic acid, 0.25 mm 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate, and 0.4 IU of orotidylate decarboxylase (Sigma). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the protein extract and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. A control reaction was prepared in the absence of 5-phosphorylribose 1-pyrophosphate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.4 ml of 0.5 m H2SO4, and the release of14CO2 was measured. The CTPSase activity was determined by the assay described by Weinfeld et al. (28Weinfeld H. Savage C.R. McPartland R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The CDase activity was determined by an adaptation of the method of Steuart and Burke (29Steuart C.D. Burke P.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 109-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A 50-μl aliquot (0.5–1.5 mg of protein) of protein extract was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm [2-14C]cytidine (0.34 mCi/mmol) in a total volume of 300 μl. Uridine kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their respective monophosphates (30Orengo A. Kobayashi S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 31Ives D.H Durham J.P. Tucker V.S. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 28: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This activity was assayed using a protocol similar to that of Orengo and Kobayashi (30Orengo A. Kobayashi S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and Ives et al. (31Ives D.H Durham J.P. Tucker V.S. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 28: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A 50-μl sample of extract (0.5–1.5 mg of protein) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm GTP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm[2-14C]uridine (0.2 mCi/mmol) in a total volume of 150 μl. The uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of [2-14C]uracil to [2-14C]UMP by the method of Lundegaard and Jensen (32Lundegaard C. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The NRase activity was assayed using a protocol similar to that of Hentschel et al. (33Hentschel U. Cary S.C. Felbeck H. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1993; 94: 35-41Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GSase activity was measured according to the protocol of Bender et al. (34Bender R.A. Janssen K.A. Resnick A.D. Blumenberg M. Foor F. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble protein extract (10 mg/400 μl) was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange column (1.5 × 4 cm; Sigma). Proteins were then eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, first alone and then with a 0.0–0.5m NaCl discontinuous gradient. One-milliliter fractions were collected and assayed for CPSase (in the presence of glutamine), ATCase, DHOase, and CDase activities. The fraction from the anion-exchange chromatography (1 ml) was injected into a 1 × 80-cm column of Sephacryl S-300 precalibrated with the following molecular mass markers: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and cytochrome c(12.4 kDa). Equilibration and elution were performed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 m NaCl. One-milliliter fractions were collected and assayed for DHOase activity. Fractions with DHOase activity were pooled and used for the kinetic determinations. Assays for orotic acid were conducted using modifications of the method described by Rogers and Porter (35Rogers L.E. Porter F.S. Pediatrics. 1968; 42: 423-428PubMed Google Scholar). A volume of 0.1 ml of HCl was added to 2.0 ml of worm blood. After 10 min, the coagulated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered with a Microsep filter (50 kDa; Pall Filtron), and the filtrate was used for determination of orotic acid. A volume of 0.25 ml of blood filtrate was mixed with 1.25 ml of 0.4 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 2.5, and then with 0.25 ml of saturated bromine water. After 1 min, 0.5 ml of 5% ascorbic acid was added to the solution. The control reaction involved identical aliquots and the same reagents, except that the ascorbic acid reagent was added before the saturated bromine water. After 2 min, 1.0 ml of 2.5%p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde dissolved in 1-propanol was added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. The absorbance due to the formation of 5-(p-dimethylaminobenzylidine)barbituric acid was determined spectrophotometrically at 480 nm. The assay for dihydroorotic acid was performed in a manner similar to that described by Rogers and Nicolaisen (36Rogers L.E. Nicolaisen K. Experientia ( Basel ). 1972; 28: 1258-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). High molecular mass molecules were removed from worm blood serum by filtration with a Macrosep filter (50 kDa), and the filtrate was used for determination of dihydroorotic acid. The buffer system used to determine the pH dependence of the enzyme activities comprised 51 mmdiethanolamine, 51 mm N-ethylmorpholine, and 100 mm MES (37Léger D. Hervé G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4293-4298Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This tri-buffer system covers the entire range of pH used without significant change in ionic strength. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin dissolved in extraction buffer as the standard. Since it was previously shown that CPSase and ATCase are present only in the trophosome (21Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the distribution of the subsequent enzymes of the pyrimidine pathway in different parts of the worm was examined. The results obtained are presented in TableI. Interestingly, it appeared that the third enzyme of this pathway, DHOase, was also present only in the trophosome, the symbiont-harboring tissue. In contrast, the next two enzymes (DHODase and OPRTase) and the last enzyme of the pathway, CTPSase, were present in all organs of the animal. The fact that the first three enzymes were present only in the trophosome raises the question of whether these enzymes belong to the bacteria or to the worm. This point was investigated in two different ways.Table IActivities of the enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine pathway in different tissues and the isolated bacterial symbiont of R. pachyptilaBody partEnzyme activitiesCPSase(Gln)ATCaseDHOaseDHODaseOPRTaseCTPSasenmol/min/mg proteinBranchial plumeNDNDND32 ± 5 (3)0.072 ± 0.004 (3)0.225 ± 0.026 (3)VestimentumNDNDND26 ± 6 (3)0.037 ± 0.003 (3)0.204 ± 0.012 (3)Trophosome1.85 ± 0.10 (3)1-aDetermined by Simon et al.

In the case of the isolated bacteria, 100-μl aliquots of extract were used under the same conditions as described for the different R. pachyptilatissues, except in the case of CTPSase activity, which was measured in 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0.

The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of determinations made on different Riftiaindividuals. ND, not detected. The same enzyme determinations were made on extracts from bacteria isolated onboard the ship, immediately after collection of the animals. The results of this analysis are given in Table I. In the bacterial extract, all enzyme activities analyzed were detected, except for glutamine-dependent CPSase (CPSase(Gln)). The instability of CPSases is well known; and most probably, this enzyme was inactivated during the isolation and/or storage of the bacterial preparations. It is noteworthy that partial inactivation of this enzyme was also observed during the analysis of trophosomal extracts by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (see below). The presence of the ATCase and DHOase activities is consistent with the hypothesis supporting the bacterial origin of these enzymes in the trophosome. The OPRTase, DHODase, and CTPSase activities were also present in the isolated bacteria, with the activity of DHODase being particularly high. Thus, it appears that, in contrast to the worm, the bacteria possess all the enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine pathway. In eukaryotes, the enzymes that catalyze the first three reactions of the pyrimidine pathway (CPSase(Gln), ATCase, and DHOase) are associated in a multifunctional protein (CAD), whereas in prokaryotes, these three enzymes are separated proteins (39Evans D.R. Bein K. Guy H.I. Liu X. Molina J.A. Zimmermann B.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine the origin of these enzymes in the trophosome, extracts were analyzed by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The results obtained (Fig.2) demonstrate that all three activities were distinctly separated. Taken together, these results and those reported above indicate that the first three enzymes of the pathway are of bacterial origin. The trophosomal location of the three first enzymes and the presence of the subsequent enzymes in all tissues of the worm suggest that the intermediary metabolite dihydroorotate must be delivered to the worm tissues. The high DHODase activity found in the bacteria (Table I) suggests that orotate might also be provided. Consequently, the presence of orotic acid and dihydroorotic acid was examined in the worm blood by colorimetric assays. Orotic acid was found at concentrations of 7.7 ± 1.1 and 12.9 ± 1.9 μmin blood samples from two different animals. Dihydroorotic acid was not detected using the dihydroorotic acid assay, whose limit of detection is ∼5 μm (36Rogers L.E. Nicolaisen K. Experientia ( Basel ). 1972; 28: 1258-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Since the trophosome can contain enzymes from both the bacteria and the worm, we attempted to distinguish between these two possibilities on the basis of some kinetic properties of these enzymes. It has been shown previously that the properties of the trophosomal ATCase (molecular mass, Km for aspartate, and sensitivity to allosteric effectors) are characteristic of bacterial enzymes (21Simon V. Purcarea C. Sun K. Joseph J. Frebourg G. Lechaire J.P. Gail F. Hervé G. Mar. Biol. 2000; 136: 115-127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As far as OPRTase and CTPSase are concerned, it can be seen in Fig. 3 (Aand B) that their pH activity profiles are significantly different in the trophosome and the vestimentum. The activity of OPRTase in the trophosome was virtually constant from pH 6 to 11. In contrast, OPRTase in the vestimentum showed a clear pH optimum of ∼7.9 (Fig. 3 A). The profiles of the enzymes in the trophosome and the vestimentum are clearly different in the acidic pH range. In an analogous fashion, the CTPSase pH activity profiles in the trophosome and the vestimentum are very different (Fig. 3 B), showing pH optima of 7.2 and 8.7, respectively. These results suggest the existence of different enzyme forms in the trophosome and the vestimentum, suggesting that the trophosome contains a bacterial CTPSase. On the basis of size-exclusion chromatography, DHOase appears to have a molecular mass of ∼110–120 kDa (data not shown), which is comparable to previously determined values in other bacteria (40Taylor W.H.

https://openalex.org/W2022894562,"The regulation of transcription of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK-C) (4.1.1.32) during diabetes is a complex process that involves a number of regulatory elements in the PEPCK-C gene promoter. The accessory factor 2 (AF2)-binding region that is contained within the glucocorticoid regulatory unit of the PEPCK-C gene promoter (−451 to −353) has been implicated in the action of both insulin and glucocorticoids on PEPCK-C gene transcription. To determine the role of AF2 in these processes, we have generated a mouse model bearing a transgene that contains the PEPCK-C gene promoter with a mutation in the AF2-binding region. This promoter is linked to the structural gene for human growth hormone that is biologically inactive (AF2–2000/hGx). In the absence of the AF2 regulatory element, the transcription of the transgene in the liver is not induced by diabetes but is inhibited by the administration of insulin. There is also a marked reduction in the response of the AF2–2000/hGx gene in the kidney to the administration of glucocorticoids. The AF2–2000/hGx gene in the liver responds normally to a high carbohydrate diet with a marked decrease in gene transcription. This suggests that insulin is not exerting its usual negative effect on the PEPCK-C gene promoter through the AF2 site. In contrast, the response of this transgene to a high fat/carbohydrate-free diet is severely blunted. Our results support a role for the AF2 site in the PEPCK-C gene promoter in the effect of glucocorticoids, but not insulin, on PEPCK-C gene transcription in the liver.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9721-9726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are three major factors involved in the induction of PEPCK-C during diabetes. First, the concentration of insulin in the blood is dramatically reduced resulting in the removal of the dominant negative regulator of PEPCK-C gene transcription. Second, there is an increase in the levels of glucagon and a subsequent elevation in the concentration of hepatic cAMP; this stimulates PEPCK-C gene transcription (10Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Third, glucocorticoids are required to ensure the elevated expression of the PEPCK-C gene and the resultant physiological alterations, including increased gluconeogenesis (11Gunn J.M. Hanson R.W. Meyuhas O. Reshef L. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1975; 150: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (12Friedman J.E. Yun J.S. Patel Y.M. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12952-12957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) responsible for the induction of PEPCK-C gene transcription during diabetes has been studied in some detail (13Granner D.K. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 369-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The effect of cAMP is exerted through two regions in the PEPCK-C gene promoter; the cAMP-response element, which maps from −90 to −83, and an up-stream regulatory element termed P3(I), which spans bases −250 to −234 in the promoter (14Liu J.-K. DiPersio C. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The regulation of PEPCK-C gene expression by glucocorticoids is accomplished through a glucocorticoid regulatory unit (GRU) in the promoter located between −451 and −353 (15Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The GRU includes a linear array of three accessory factor-binding sites, AF1 (−451 to −439), AF2 (−416 to −407), and AF3 (−326 to −321), and two glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites, GR1 and GR2 (−386 to −353) (15Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The GRU can bind a variety of transcription factors. The AF1 site binds the chicken ovalbumin up-stream promoter transcription factor and hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4). Both the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family members C/EBPα and C/EBPβ and HNF-3 bind to the AF2 site, but it has been shown that HNF-3 mediates PEPCK-C gene transcription (16Wang J. Stromstedt P. O'Brien R. Granner D. Mol Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). The AF2-binding site also contains an overlapping glucocorticoid response element (GRE) and an insulin regulatory sequence (IRS), which regulate the glucocorticoid and insulin responses. A third accessory site has been characterized by Scottet al. (15Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and shown to bind chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor and up-stream stimulatory factor. A single mutation in any one of these three AF elements results in a 60% decrease of the glucocorticoid response in hepatocytes, whereas a mutation in any two AF elements completely eliminates the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK-C gene promoter mediated by the GRU (15Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As suggested by the overlapping GRE and IRS within the AF2 element, the AF1, AF2, and AF3 are also required for other hormone responses. Both the AF1 (17Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and AF3 contain GRE and retinoic acid response elements (15Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and are necessary for the response of the PEPCK-C gene promoter to retinoic acid. The AF2 element contains an IRS (18O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnunson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) that has been proposed to mediate part of the negative response of the gene to insulin (19O'Brien R.M. Noison E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.-C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study focuses on use of transgenic animals carrying a mutated AF2 element (in the PEPCK-C gene promoter −2000 to +73) linked to the human growth hormone structural gene (hGx), which lacks a receptor-binding site and thus is biologically inactive. We have analyzed the transcriptional response of the transgene to diabetes, insulin replacement, administration of glucocorticoids, and alterations in dietary protein and carbohydrate. The results suggest that the AF2 element of the GRU is necessary for induction of PEPCK-C mRNA by glucocorticoids during diabetes and that the effect of insulin on this site is modest at best. Theophylline, Bt2cAMP, streptozotocin, and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma. Strip-EZ DNA probe synthesis kit was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GeneScreen Plus and [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes and proteinase K were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The synthetic diets (20McGrane M.M. deVente J. Yun J. Bloom J. Park E.A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Wagner T. Rottman F.M.

Human recombinant insulin was obtained from Calbiochem. The PEPCK-C probe used was a 1.1-kilobase PstI fragment from the 3′-end of the PEPCK-C cDNA, as described previously (20McGrane M.M. deVente J.

RNA was normalized with a 752-nt SacI fragment from the mouse 18 S rRNA cDNA as described by Oberbaumer (21Oberbaumer I. Nucleic Acids. 1992; 20: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 700-base pair SmaI cDNA hGx fragment (22Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) was used to screen the hGx transgenic mice by Southern blotting. All probes were synthesized using [α32P]dATP and a Strip-EZ DNA random-primed StripAble DNA probe synthesis and removal kit from Ambion (Austin, Texas). A mutation was introduced into the specific protein-binding domains of the PEPCK-C gene promoter (−490 to +72) or (−2000 to +72) using a variation of the method of Kunkel (23Kunkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar) as described by Liu et al. (24Liu J. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. Biotechniques. 1990; 9: 738-741PubMed Google Scholar). The AF2 mutation replaced the entire sequence of the AF2 element (−414 to −405) from the wild type sequence of 5′-ACCGATATCA-3′ to a nonspecific sequence of 5′-TGGTGTTTTG-3′. The mutated AF2 or the WT promoter fragment was used to construct the transgene for AF2 or WT control lines, respectively. Briefly, either the −2000-base pairSacI-BglII or the −490XbaI-BglII region of the cytosolic form of the PEPCK-C gene promoter from the rat was ligated to a 2.2-kilobaseBamHI-EcoRV fragment containing the human growth hormone (hGx) reporter gene. The hGx reporter gene has a frameshift mutation in exon 5 that affects the 55 carboxyl-terminal amino acids and thus does not produce active growth hormone (25Idzerda R.L. Behringer R.R. Theisen M. Huggenvik J.I. McKnight G.S. Brinster R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5154-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 presents a diagram of the genes used in this study and the location of the mutated AF2 element. Recombinant DNA used for microinjection was separated from plasmid sequences by digestion withXbaI for WT-2000/hGx and AF2–2000/hGx orXbaI-BglII for WT-490/hGx and AF2–490/hGx, followed by electrophoresis. DNA was electroeluted from the agarose gel and then used for microinjection into fertilized mouse eggs. The procedure for the generation of transgenic mice has been described previously (26Patel Y.M. Yun J.S. Liu J. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5619-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fertilized eggs were flushed from the oviducts of super-ovulated C57BL/6× SJL mice. 2 μl of DNA solution (2 ng/μl) was injected into the male pronuclei of the fertilized mouse eggs. Viable embryos were re-implanted into the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant mice as described previously (26Patel Y.M. Yun J.S. Liu J. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5619-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by genomic DNA analysis of tail samples taken at 4 weeks of age. Briefly, small segments of mouse tail were placed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, and 24 μg of proteinase K overnight at 55 °C. 1 μl of this solution, containing the lysed tail cells, was used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify the hGx gene. The primers used were hGH1, 5′-TTGCAGCTAGGTGAGCT-3′; and hGH2, 5′-CTTTGGCCGTGGGGAGTG-3′. Six lines were generated for AF2 2000, four lines were generated for each of WT 390 and AF2 490 transgenes, and one line was generated for the WT 2000. All lines of transgenic mice demonstrated the tissue-specific pattern of expression characteristic of the endogenous PEPCK-C gene, with highest expression levels in liver and expression in the kidney ∼20% that of hepatic expression. The transgenic mice were normal in body weight and showed no evidence of hepatomegaly or other disorders. Male mice heterozygous for the transgene were back-crossed to C57BL/6× SJL WT females. Only mice heterozygous for the transgene were used for analysis. There were no gender differences noted in the level of expression of hGx mRNA, so both male and female mice heterozygous for the transgene were used. Adult animals were 2–4 months of age at the time of study; they were given free access to water and were fed standard laboratory chow, unless otherwise specified. Adult animals were killed between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 35 mg of Bt2cAMP per kg of body weight and 30 mg of theophylline per kg of body weight in 150 μl of saline or not injected (controls). The animals were killed 2 h later, and their livers and kidneys were isolated, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored for analysis at −70 °C. Animals were made diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg body weight). Mice were fasted overnight prior to injection and fed 2 h later. Diabetes was confirmed by measuring the concentration of blood glucose (tail vein) using glucose dipsticks and an ENCORE® glucometer (VWR Scientific). Animals treated with insulin received 1 unit per 30 grams of body weight. All diabetic animals had blood glucose concentrations of more than 300 mg/dl. To determine the effect of glucocorticoids on the PEPCK-C gene promoter in the transgenic mice, the animals were injected with 1 μm dexamethasone, and their livers and kidneys were removed 5 h later. The tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. For dietary studies, the mice were fed either a high carbohydrate diet that contained 81.5% glucose, 12.2% casein, 0.3%dl-methionine, 4% cottonseed oil, 2% brewers' yeast, and 1% mineral mix with vitamins for 1 week or a high fat/carbohydrate-free diet that contained 64% casein, 22% nutritive fiber, 11% vegetable oil, 2% brewers' yeast, and 1% mineral mix plus vitamins. (27McGrane M.M. Yun J.S. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Hendrick G.K. Arafah B.M. Park E.A. Wagner T.E. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22371-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As controls, mice were fed normal laboratory chowad libitum. The animals were anesthetized, and the liver and kidneys were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C for subsequent analysis. Total RNA was isolated from the liver using a QuickPrep total RNA extraction kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Total RNA was isolated from the kidneys using the modified acid-phenol guanidine thiocyanate procedure described previously (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (29Eisenberger C.L. Nechushtan H. Cohen H. Shanti M. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1396-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using 20 μg of total RNA. Gels were blotted to GeneScreen Plus and hybridized with PEPCK-C cDNA or hGx cDNA probes at 42 °C in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide (deionized), 1% SDS, 1 msodium chloride, 110 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm, and 10% dextran sulfate. The filters were washed at 55 °C in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min and 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min. The relative radioactivity was determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The concentration of PEPCK-C mRNA and hGx mRNA were expressed relative to the concentration of 18 S ribosomal RNA to control for differences in loading of the RNA. Male mice heterozygous for the transgene were back-crossed to C57BL/6× SJL non-transgenic females. On day 19 of gestation, the livers and kidneys were removed from fetal mice, and the RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern analysis using an hGx cDNA probe. The concentration of hGx mRNA was expressed relative to 18 S ribosomal RNA. The gene for PEPCK-C is not expressed in the liver before birth (30Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), partly because of repression by insulin. Because the AF2 site has been implicated in the insulin regulation of PEPCK-C gene transcription (18O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnunson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we analyzed the role of the AF2 element in the developmental expression of the PEPCK-C gene in the liver and kidney. For this purpose, chimeric genes were constructed that contained either the wild type promoter (WT) or a gene with a deletion for AF2 element (AF2) in the −2000 or −490 region of the PEPCK-C gene promoter that was ligated to the hGx structural gene (Fig.1). These chimeric genes were used to generate transgenic animals. Heterozygous, transgenic males were then mated to C57BL/6× SJL non-transgenic females. Each litter consisted of non-transgenic controls and heterozygous transgenic littermates. The livers and kidneys of 19-day-old fetuses were collected from each line, and the level of hepatic and kidney hGx mRNA transcribed from the −2000 and −490 segments of the PEPCK-C gene promoter, with and without the AF2 regulatory element, were measured by Northern hybridization (Fig. 2). Chimeric genes containing the WT-2000, AF2–2000, and WT-490 promoters expressed very little hGx mRNA in the liver and kidney before birth. The AF2–490/hGx gene, however, had an unexpected high level of expression before birth in both the kidney and liver compared with WT (*,p < 0.05). This result demonstrates the importance of the AF2 element in the PEPCK-C gene promoter for the correct developmental expression of this gene before birth. The gene for PEPCK-C is not expressed in the liver before birth (30Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The high levels of glucose from the maternal circulation repress expression of the gene in the fetal liver and the subsequent production of insulin by the fetal pancreas. At birth, there is a decrease in the concentration of glucose in the blood, accompanied by a decrease in secretion of insulin and an increase in hepatic cAMP (31Girard J.R. Cuendet G.S. Marliss E.B. Kervran A. Rieutort M. Assan R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 3190-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); this initiates transcription of the gene for PEPCK-C in the liver. In the absence of the AF2 site, we noted a premature appearance of hGx mRNA in the livers of 19-day-old fetal mice. This occurred only when the AF2 mutation was in the PEPCK-C gene promoter from −490 to +73, suggesting that a region of the promoter between −490 and −2000 contains an element required to suppress the premature expression of PEPCK-C in the fetal liver. More work will be required to identify this region of the PEPCK-C gene promoter. To dissect the role of AF2 in the response of the PEPCK-C gene to diabetes and to the subsequent administration of insulin, the animals were made diabetic by injection of streptozotocin (the blood glucose concentration was in excess of 300 mg/dl in these mice). In all animals, the endogenous gene for PEPCK-C responded to diabetes as expected, i.e. the mRNA increased in diabetes and decreased when insulin was injected (Fig. 3 B). The WT-2000/hGx transgene was induced 1.7-fold by diabetes as shown by an increased hepatic hGx mRNA; insulin reduced its expression by half when administered for 8 h. The difference in the time course of response to insulin may be attributable to differences in half-life between PEPCK-C and hGx mRNAs. Transcription of the AF2–2000/hGx transgene in the liver was not induced by diabetes but was inhibited 50% by insulin treatment (Fig. 3 A) (**, p< 0.05). This finding strongly suggests that AF2 is necessary for the induction of PEPCK-C by diabetes but that it is not involved in the response of the PEPCK-C gene promoter to insulin. The AF2 regulatory element in the PEPCK-C gene promoter contains a glucocorticoid-binding site, as well as an insulin regulatory element. Because glucocorticoids are required for the increase in PEPCK-C gene transcription that occurs during diabetes (12Friedman J.E. Yun J.S. Patel Y.M. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12952-12957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next determined the response of the AF2–2000/hGx transgene to glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone (1 μm) was administered to both WT-2000/hGx and AF2–2000/hGx transgenic mice; the animals were killed 5 h later. The administration of dexamethasone had no effect on the concentration of mRNA for hGx in the livers of WT-2000/hGx and AF2–2000/hGx transgenic mice (Fig.4 A). The lack of response of the transgenes to dexamethasone was expected, because it is well established that glucocorticoids cause an increase in the secretion of insulin (11Gunn J.M. Hanson R.W. Meyuhas O. Reshef L. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1975; 150: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); this insulin secretion would, in turn, prevent the induction of transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter (12Friedman J.E. Yun J.S. Patel Y.M. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12952-12957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we determined the response to glucocorticoids of both transgenes in the kidney. There was a 3-fold induction of hGx mRNA in the kidneys of AF2–2000/hGx transgenic mice, accompanied by a 5.5-fold induction of hGx mRNA in the kidneys of WT-2000/hGx mice (Fig. 4 B) (*, p < 0.05). Thus the loss of one accessory factor 2-binding site resulted in a 60% reduction in the glucocorticoid response of the transgene. These data are consistent with the in vitro studies of Scott et al. (15Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 261: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar,32Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol.

We have shown that the AF2-binding site in the PEPCK-C gene promoter is critical for the regulation of PEPCK-C mRNA by glucocorticoids. The AF2-binding site has an overlapping GRE and a putative IRS that can potentially bind C/EBPβ and HNF-4; both can then act as accessory factors for the glucocorticoid response. In animals with a deletion in the gene for C/EBPβ, the glucocorticoid response is totally blocked. 2C. M. Croniger and R. W. Hanson, unpublished results. C/EBPβ binds to the PEPCK-C gene promoter through the cAMP-response element-1 and P3(I) regions, both of which are downstream from the AF2-binding site and GRU. Yamada et al. (33Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5580-5587Google Scholar) have determined that C/EBPβ is an accessory factor for the glucocorticoid response by acting via the cAMP-response element region in the PEPCK-C gene promoter. This suggests a complex mechanism for the regulation of PEPCK-C by glucocorticoids. Recently Leahy et al. (34Leahy P. Crawford D.R. Grossman G. Chaudhry A. Gronostajski R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8813-8822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have stressed the role of CREB-binding protein in coordinating the regulation of the PEPCK-C promoter. CREB-binding protein can bind both steroids and C/EBPβ, which interact with the promoter. It is likely that the AF2 region interacts with the GR or with a protein that binds the GR. Here we note that the lack of an AF2 site results in a 60% reduction in the increase in hGx mRNA when stimulated with glucocorticoids. Thus, the absence of a binding site for AF2 may disrupt the ability to form the needed complex with CREB-binding protein and C/EBPβ. Feeding mice a diet high in carbohydrate (or a high fat/carbohydrate-free diet) markedly decreases (or increases) the transcription of the gene for PEPCK-C in the liver (20McGrane M.M. deVente J. Yun J. Bloom J. Park E.A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Wagner T. Rottman F.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11443-11451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is presumably because of the secretion of insulin by the pancreas that in turn represses hepatic PEPCK-C gene transcription. To determine whether the AF2 regulatory element in the PEPCK-C gene promoter is involved in the response of the gene to dietary carbohydrate, WT-2000/hGx and AF2–2000/hGx transgenic mice were fed a high carbohydrate diet for 1 week. This diet did not significantly alter the blood glucose concentration of the animals. Control mice fed a normal lab chow diet had a blood glucose level of 124 mg/dl ± 6.4, whereas mice fed a high carbohydrate diet had a blood glucose level of 114 mg/dl ± 12.9. The high carbohydrate diet dramatically decreased the level of hGx mRNA in the livers of both the WT-2000/hGx and AF2–2000/hGx transgenic mice. This demonstrates that the AF2 site in the PEPCK-C gene promoter is not required for the transcriptional response of the promoter to dietary carbohydrate and presumably to insulin (Fig.5). Mice that were fed the high carbohydrate diet for 1 week were then injected with Bt2cAMP and theophylline to stimulate transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter. There was no difference in the response to Bt2cAMP between the WT-2000/hGx and AF2–2000/hGx transgenes, indicating that the AF2 site is not required for the effect of cAMP on PEPCK-C gene transcription in the liver. Finally, the mice were fed a diet in which the protein content was not changed, but the carbohydrate was replaced with fat (high fat/carbohydrate-free diet). There was a robust 3.4-fold stimulation in the level of hGx mRNA in the livers of the WT-2000/hGx mice as compared with hGx mRNA in the livers of the same lines of mice fed a control diet (Fig. 5). In contrast, the AF2–2000/hGx transgenic mice had a 50% increase in response to the high fat/carbohydrate-free diet. If a high carbohydrate diet inhibits transcription from the PEPCK-C gene promoter via the action of insulin then the AF2 site is clearly not required for the insulin effect. It is possible that insulin inhibits PEPCK-C gene transcription via another site on the promoter. In this regard, we have recently found that sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) is an intermediate in the action of insulin on transcription of the PEPCK-C gene in hepatocytes. 3K. Chakravarty, P. Ferre, F. Foufelle, and R. W. Hanson, unpublished data. Hasty et al. (35Hasty A.H. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Perrey S. Yoshikawa T. Osuga J. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31069-31077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have reported that the addition of 5.5 to 25 mm glucose to hepatocytes in culture increases the concentration of mature SREBP-1c in the nucleus, most likely by inducing the level of mRNA for the transcription factor. In addition, reporter gene analysis demonstrated a glucose-induced increase in transcription from the SREBP-1c gene promoter (35Hasty A.H. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Perrey S. Yoshikawa T. Osuga J. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Shionoiri F. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31069-31077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that dietary glucose, which induces insulin secretion in the mice, increased the level of SREBP-1c in the liver leading to a repression of PEPCK-C gene transcription. If so, this must occur at a site on the PEPCK-C gene promoter distinct from the AF2-binding site. In the absence of the AF2 site, there is a blunted transcriptional response of the PEPCK-C gene promoter to a high fat/carbohydrate-free diet. This suggests that this site is needed to achieve the full stimulation of transcription when the concentration of insulin is decreased by feeding the mice a high fat/carbohydrate-free diet. This is very similar to the response of the AF2–2000/hGx transgene to diabetes where the stimulatory response is blunted (see Fig. 3). We assume that the increase in transcription of the hepatic AF2–2000/hGx transgene caused by feeding a high fat/carbohydrate-free diet is partly because of the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids on the PEPCK-C gene promoter. Alternatively, the AF2 site is adjacent to a PPAR-binding domain that maps at −451 to −439 (36Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A diet high in fat increases the concentration of PPARα in the liver (37Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the absence of the AF2 site, PPARα might be less effective in inducing PEPCK-C gene transcription. Clearly, further work is needed to establish the exact effect of a high fat/carbohydrate-free diet on the control of PEPCK-C gene transcription. We are indebted to Dr. Ifeanyi J. Arinze for critically reading the manuscript and to Jianqi Yang for help in preparing the figures."

In this study, we used purified Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p to characterize their telomere binding activity. We found that the binding specificity of single-stranded TG1–3 DNA by these two proteins is similar. However, the affinity of Cdc13(451–693)p to DNA was slightly lower than that of Cdc13p. The binding of telomeric DNA by these two proteins was disrupted at NaCl concentrations higher than 0.3m, indicating that electrostatic interaction contributed significantly to the binding process. Because both proteins bound to strand TG1–3 DNA positioned at the 3′ end, the 5′ end, or in the middle of the oligonucleotide substrates, our results indicated that the location of TG1–3 in single-stranded DNA does not appear to be important for Cdc13p binding. Moreover, using DNase I footprint analysis, the structure of the telomeric DNA complexes of Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p was analyzed. The DNase I footprints of these two proteins to three different telomeric DNA substrates were virtually identical, indicating that the telomere contact region of Cdc13p is within Cdc13(451–693)p. Together, the binding properties of Cdc13p and its binding domain support the theory that the specific binding of Cdc13p to telomeres is an important feature of telomeres that regulate telomerase access and/or differentiate natural telomeres from broken ends.

For example, ciliated protozoa telomeres are extended to form a 12–16-base single-stranded G-tail (1Klobutcher L.A. Swanton M.T. Donini P. Prescott D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among these protein factors, Oxytricha telomere-binding protein has been well characterized. It is heterodimeric and is composed of an α and β subunit (20Fang G. Gray J.T. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Fang G. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The α subunit is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that binds to the G4T4 single-stranded end of a telomere. Although the β subunit is not directly involved in binding, it is required for making the terminus-specific binding. Cdc13p is a single-stranded TG1–3-binding protein that interacts with telomeres in S. cerevisiae (13Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 14Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5600-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, although Cdc13p in yeast is the functional equivalent of Oxytricha α- and β-binding proteins, it shares no sequence similarity with Oxytrichatelomere-binding proteins (13Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 14Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5600-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The binding of Cdc13p to telomeric DNA is essential for its function in telomeres (24Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and it appears to have multiple functions in cells. For example, Cdc13p is involved in cell cycle control since a temperature-sensitive allele of CDC13, cdc13-1, causes cell cycles to arrest in the G2/M phase at non-permissive temperatures (25Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The binding of Cdc13p to telomeres might cause yeast cells to differentiate whether the ends of linear DNA are telomeres or broken ends (26Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc13p appears to be a key factor in telomere replication. It interacts with Est1p that is associated with telomerase RNA (27Evans S.K. Lundblad V. Science. 1999; 286: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 28Qi H. Zakian V.A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2817-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to recruit telomerase to telomeres for replication. This was evidenced in part by the presence of a mutant allele of CDC13, cdc13 est, which causes a gradual loss of the telomere (13Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V. Science. 1996; 274: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cdc13p could interact with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α, suggesting that it might be involved in a C-strand synthesis of telomeres (28Qi H. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1777-1788PubMed Google Scholar). 1C.-L. Hsu and J.-J. Lin, unpublished results. It might also prevent end-to-end fusion of chromosomes and protect chromosome from degradation by nucleases. CDC13 is an essential gene that encodes a 924-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 104,895 Da (25Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The Cdc13p fragment ranging from amino acids 451 to 693, Cdc13(451–693)p, contains the telomere-binding region of Cdc13p; it is sufficient to bind single-stranded telomeric DNA in vitro and interacts with telomeres in vivo (24Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Hughes T.R. Weilbaecher R.G. Walterscheid M. Lundblad V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6457-6462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, a sequence comparison among Cdc13(451–693)p and known DNA- or RNA-binding proteins did not provide any information on Cdc13(451–693)p responsible for binding to telomeres (24Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdc13(451–693)p contains a novel motif for telomere binding. To understand how Cdc13p interacts with telomeres, we used purified Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p to analyze their binding properties. The results of both EMSA2 and DNase I footprint analysis revealed the specific binding of telomeric DNA by these two proteins. A baculovirus system was used to purify Cdc13p. An insect cell line sf21 was used as the host for virus propagation and protein purification. Escherichia coliDH5α was used as a host for plasmid construction and propagation, and BL21(DE3)pLysS was used as the host for Cdc13(451–693)p purification. Plasmid pBac6His-CDC13 was constructed by inserting a 3.0-kilobase pairNcoI-SalI fragment of CDC13 toNcoI- and SalI-digested pBac6His (modified from pBlueBac4 by J.-J. Lin, Invitrogen). This plasmid enabled the expression of Cdc13p with 6xHis tagged at the N terminus. A recombinant virus that expressed 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p was generated by co-infection of plasmid pBac6His-CDC13 and Bac-N-Blue DNA to sf21 cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid pET6H-CDC13(451–693), which was used to purify the Cdc13(451–693)p, was constructed by inserting theNcoI-NruI fragment of pTHA-NLS-CDC13(451–924) into NcoI-SmaI-digested pET6H (donated by C.-H. Hu, National Marine University, Taipei, Taiwan). The resulting plasmid was used to express 6xHis-tagged Cdc13(451–693)p under the control of the T7 promoter (24Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To purify 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p, ∼5 × 107 sf21 cells were infected with recombinant virus for 4 days. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspensions were incubated on ice for 40 min and then sonicated. Total cell extracts were then collected by centrifugation. Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was used to purify the 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p. Batch purification protocol was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The bound 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p was eluted by buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol. Purified protein was aliquoted and frozen by a dry ice-ethanol bath. The yield of Cdc13p was ∼0.5 mg/107cells. To purify 6xHis-tagged Cdc13(451–693)p, a 1-liter culture of E. coli harboring pET6H-CDC13(451–693) was grown at 25 °C toA 600 to 0.5 and induced with the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown at 25 °C for another 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercapto ethanol, 1 × protease inhibitors (Calbiochem)) and sonicated to release the cell contents. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain total cell free extracts. 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was added to the total cell free extracts and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed and eluted with 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol. Purified protein was aliquoted and frozen by the dry ice-ethanol bath. The yield of Cdc13(451–693)p was ∼4.2 mg from 1 liter of E. coli culture. Oligonucleotides (Table I) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and subsequently purified from a 10% sequencing gel after electrophoresis. To perform the assays (12Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4906-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Cdc13p or Cdc13(451–693)p in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of heat-denatured poly[dI-dC]) was mixed with 5 nm32P-labeled TG15 DNA with a total volume of 15 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then, the mixtures were loaded directly onto an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was prerun at 125 V for 10 min. Electrophoresis was carried out in TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) at 125 V for 105 min. The gels were dried, autoradiographed, and the amounts of oligonucleotides bound to the proteins were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequencesTG105′-GGGTGTGGTG-3′TG135′-TGTGGGTGTGGTG-3′TG155′-TGTGTGGGTGTGGTG-3′TG205′-TGGTGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTG-3′TG255′-GGGTGTGGTGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTG-3′TG305′-TGTGTGGGTGTGGTGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTG-3′TG355′-TGGTGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTG-3′(TG)125′-TGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTG-3′(TGG)85′-TGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGG-3′(TGGG)65′-TGGGTGGGTGGGTGGGTGGGTGGG-3′Int.

Telomeric DNA strands were 5′-labeled and purified as described above. The DNA was mixed with Cdc13p or Cdc13(451–693)p in 40 μl of Buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mmCaCl2) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. 1 unit of DNase I was added and incubated at 37 °C for another 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 250 mm EGTA. The DNA was then precipitated by adding 1 μl of 10 mg/ml oyster glycogen and 150 μl of ethanol. The precipitant was collected by centrifugation, dried, and analyzed by electrophoresis using a 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The baculovirus expression system was used to purify Cdc13p. In this study, Cdc13p with six histidines tagged at the N terminus was expressed in insect sf21 cells, and the protein was purified to homogeneity using a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Fig. 1, lane 2). The purified protein has an apparent mass of 105 kDa, which is in agreement with the predicted size of Cdc13p. Western blotting analysis further confirmed that it is Cdc13p (data not shown). The binding specificity of Cdc13p to telomeric DNA was determined using EMSA analysis. Purified protein was mixed with 32P-labeled single-stranded TG1–3 with various amounts of unlabeled nucleic acid competitors before subjecting to the EMSA analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, unlabeled TG15 competed efficiently with 32P-labeled TG15. The binding was reduced by ∼50% when the competitor was presented at equal concentrations (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–6, and Fig. 2 B). Vertebrate (T2AG3) telomeric DNA also competed for Cdc13p binding (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–9), although a 10-fold molar excess of (T2AG3)3 was needed to obtain the same level of competition as that from TG15 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Oxytricha (T4G4) andTetrahymena (T2G4) telomeric DNA did not compete for the binding of TG15 to Cdc13p (Fig. 2 A,lanes 7–12). Total yeast RNA, single-stranded C1–3A DNA, or duplex TG1–3/C1–3A DNA did not compete for Cdc13p binding (Fig. 3 A, lanes 16–18) (data not shown). Interestingly, Cdc13p formed two complexes with TG15, although the nature of these multiple complexes is unclear. Nevertheless, these results indicated that Cdc13p bound specifically to single-stranded TG1–3 telomeric DNA.Figure 3Specific binding of Cdc13(451–693)p to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA.

Although Cdc13(451–693)p formed insoluble aggregates at 37 °C (24Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a sufficient amount of soluble Cdc13(451–693)p, however, could be obtained at 25 °C (Fig. 1,lane 3). We then investigated the binding properties of the purified Cdc13(451–693)p. Similar to Cdc13p, purified Cdc13(451–693)p bound specifically to single-stranded TG1–3 telomeric DNA (Fig. 3). However, only one distinct complex was observed. This result further confirmed our conclusion that the telomeric DNA-binding domain of Cdc13p is located within amino acids 451–693. Identical results were previously obtained with Cdc13p fusion protein and chemically renatured Cdc13(451–693)p (14Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13760-13765Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Previously, E. coliextracts containing Cdc13p fused to glutathioneS-transferase was used to show that Cdc13p bound specifically to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA in vitro (14Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13760-13765Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and the renatured Cdc13(451–693)p was used to demonstrate that this region contained the telomere-binding domain of Cdc13p, and its binding to telomeres was specific (24Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p could bind to long single-stranded TG1–3 telomeric DNA, Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p were mixed with telomeric DNA substrates with different lengths, and the complexes were analyzed. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrated that both Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p were capable of forming complexes with long telomeric DNA. Multiple protein-DNA complexes were apparent in long DNA substrates, and the patterns of the complexes suggested that more than one protein could bind to a single DNA molecule. We also determined the binding affinity of Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p to these DNA substrates. An apparent binding constant was determined from the Hill plot. As shown in Table II, Cdc13(451–693)p appears to bind to telomeric DNA with an affinity similar to that of Cdc13p. Cdc13p required telomeric sequences longer than 13 bases for proper binding, whereas Cdc13(451–693)p required 15 bases for proper binding. The telomeric DNA sequences of S. cerevisiae are combinations of TG, TGG, and TGGG repeats. To test if Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p have a sequence preference, the binding affinities of these two proteins for (TG)12, (TGG)8, or (TGGG)6 were determined. As shown in Table II, the apparent binding constants of Cdc13p to these three substrates were similar to other telomeric DNA substrates. This result suggested that Cdc13p did not favor either repeat for binding. However, Cdc13(451–693)p bound to these three substrates with affinities significantly lower than binding to other telomeric DNA substrates, suggesting that the telomeric DNA-binding domain alone preferred TG1–3 sequences for binding. Oxytricha telomere-binding proteins were shown to bind to T4G4 telomeric DNA at a high concentration of salt (22Gottschling D.E. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 195-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32Price C.M. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Price C.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether the affinity of Cdc13p or Cdc13(451–693)p for TG15 may depend on NaCl concentrations. As shown in Fig. 5, both proteins dissociated from TG15 at a NaCl concentration higher than 0.3m. However, Cdc13(451–693)p appeared to tolerate NaCl better than Cdc13p. To evaluate the stability of the protein-DNA complex, the dissociation rate of protein-DNA complex was measured. Cdc13p or Cdc13(451–693)p was first bound to 32P-labeled TG15, and then an excess amount of unlabeled TG15 was added to prevent a re-association of protein to labeled DNA. The dissociation rate was estimated as the time required for half of the protein-DNA complex to dissociate. As shown in Fig. 6, both Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p had dissociation rates ∼30 min, suggesting that these two proteins bound to telomeric DNA with similar stability. To determine if single-stranded TG1–3 has to locate at the 3′ end for Cdc13p binding, we synthesized oligonucleotides, 5′-Tel, Int-Tel, and 3′-Tel (Table I), of identical size harboring telomeric sequences at various locations. They were tested for Cdc13p binding by EMSA. Because all three substrates bound to Cdc13p or Cdc13(451–693)p to the same extent (Fig. 7), the location of TG1–3 in a single-stranded DNA does not appear significant for Cdc13p binding. In Fig. 7, the three oligonucleotides migrated differently on a polyacrylamide gel even though they have the same size and were heat-denatured and quick-cooled on ice before the binding assay. This result suggested an intrinsic position-dependent structure of these oligonucleotides. Also, although Int-Tel DNA gave the slowest mobility on the polyacrylamide gel, it had a slightly faster mobility upon binding to Cdc13(451–693)p. This migration behavior suggested that Cdc13(451–693)p bound to telomeric DNA and minimized the position-dependent structure of the DNA substrates. Moreover, faster mobility caused by protein binding to the middle of the DNA fragment would imply a protein-induced structural alteration of the DNA. To investigate the effect of Cdc13p binding to telomeric DNA in detail, the structure of protein-DNA complexes was subjected to DNase I footprint analysis. Autoradiograms of Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p footprints are shown in Figs. 8 and9, respectively, and the results are summarized in Fig. 10. Both Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p selectively protected telomeric sequences from DNase I digestion. The footprints of these two proteins with various DNA were nearly identical, suggesting that amino acid 451–693 of Cdc13p was the region that made contact with telomeres. It is interesting to note that the binding of Cdc13p produced several DNase I hypersensitive sites right next to the protection area, although the nature of these hypersensitive sites is unclear.Figure 9DNase I footprints of Cdc13(451–693)p to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA. The footprint assay was done using 5 nm each of 5′-Tel, Int-Tel, or 3′-Tel. The concentrations of Cdc13(451–693)p were 40 nm (lane 3) and 160 nm (lane 4), respectively.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the interaction of this protein with telomeric DNA. In this study, we purified Cdc13p in native form and its telomere-binding domain, Cdc13(451–693)p. Using these purified proteins, the telomeric DNA binding properties were characterized. Both Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p bound to telomeric DNA with similar specificity and stability. Furthermore, DNase I footprints showed virtually identical binding of telomeric DNA by both Cdc13p and Cdc13(451–693)p, indicating that amino acid 451–693 is the region within Cdc13p that contacts telomere DNA. A dissociation constant of ∼10−7m is corresponding to ∼10 kcal/mol of binding energy. Binding energies of this magnitude are certainly common among macromolecule-macromolecule interactions. We proposed that the binding of Cdc13p to telomeric DNA was the result of at least two factors, specific bond formation to nucleic acid bases and nonspecific electrostatic interaction. The binding to yeast telomeric DNA was not reduced by competition with telomeric DNA from other species, suggesting that the binding is sequence-specific, and specific interaction between Cdc13p and the bases of nucleic acids should be critical for telomere binding. Moreover, because the binding is sensitive to ionic strength, electrostatic interaction must contribute significantly to the binding. This property is significantly different from that ofOxytricha telomere-binding protein, which used a series of aromatic amino acid residues to interact with the extended bases of single-stranded T4G4 DNA (34Horvath M.P. Schweiker V.L. Bevilacqua J.M. Ruggles J.A. Schultz S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 963-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). InOxytricha, the phosphodiester-sugar backbone that contributes to electrostatic interaction was largely solvent-exposed. It could be worthwhile in future work to gain more precise information on this protein-DNA interaction. In Fig. 7, EMSA analysis implicated a structure alteration of telomeric DNA induced by Cdc13(451–693)p. Similarly, DNase I footprint analysis also supports the presence of protein-induced alteration on DNA (Figs.8 and 9). DNase I hypersensitive sites are positions of DNA that are easily digested by DNase I. These positions usually represent DNA with aberrant structure. For example, DNA bends on double-stranded DNA usually cause hypersensitive sites by DNase I digestion. Although we do not know the exact nature of the structural change in the single-stranded telomeric DNA induced by Cdc13p, it appeared that Cdc13p indeed caused structural alteration in telomeric DNA. Such alteration caused by Cdc13p may be an important feature of telomeres. Protein-induced DNA distortion at specific sites is considered to be an important mechanism for promoting the multiprotein interactions involved in regulation of gene activity (35Liu-Johnson H.N.

Moreover, Cdc13p was proposed to mediate telomerase access to telomeres (27Evans S.K. Lundblad V. Science. 1999; 286: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Thus, the alteration of telomeric DNA by Cdc13p might facilitate the formation of a multiprotein complex on telomeres. Alternatively, the single-stranded telomeric tail was shown to loop back to the double-stranded region of telomeres to form a “t-loop” structure in mammalian telomeres (44Griffith J.D. Comeau L.

Strikingly, these proteins regulate gene expression within islet cell types and during pancreogenesis. Thus, an inactivating mutation in the pdx-1locus affects a very early development step that prevents both exocrine and endocrine pancreas formation (19Jonsson J. Carlson L. Edlund T. Edlund H.

Moreover, the ability of islet β cells to produce insulin in sufficient amounts to meet the needs of the body is compromised in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with an inactivating mutation within one allele of the BETA2 (22Malecki M.T. Jhala U.S. Antonellis A. Fields L. Doria A. Orban T. Saad M. Warram J.H. Montminy M. Krolewski A.S. Nat.

Collectively, these results established a central role for each of the isolated insulin gene transcription factors in islet cell development and function.In contrast to the other primary control elements of the insulin gene, the C1 element activator, RIPE3b1 (7Shieh S.Y.

RIPE3b1 DNA binding is mediated by a β cell-enriched protein(s) of ∼46 kDa, whose activity is reduced by either calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP)1 or a brain-enriched phosphatase preparation (BPP) treatment (9Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggested that RIPE3b1 binding is regulated by phosphorylation, a posttranslational modification mechanism also utilized in controlling PDX-1 activation (25Macfarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M. Bujalska I. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In an effort to more fully understand the role that phosphorylation plays in RIPE3b1 function, we have characterized the phosphatase activity that affects RIPE3b1 binding within the β cell. Our findings strongly suggest the RIPE3b1 activation is influenced by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue(s) within the 46-kDa DNA-binding protein.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that the phosphorylation status of transcription factors, including those involved in insulin gene expression, can play an essential role in activation. The most common site of protein phosphorylation is at serine and threonine residues, and this type of modification has been shown to control the function of a wide variety of transcription factors (34Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). For example, serine/threonine kinase signaling appears to induce PDX-1 activation in high glucose-treated β cells through effects on both nuclear translocation and DNA binding (26Macfarlane W.M.

In contrast, phosphorylation at tyrosine residues within transcription factors is found infrequently, with the only known proteins represented by the signal transducers and activators of transcription (i.e. STAT 1–6) (42Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and nuclear factor 1-like transcription factor (BEF-1 (43Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). However, because many different types of stimuli that affect gene expression also lead to the activation of tyrosine protein kinases, it is likely that other transcription factors will be directly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation.Insulin secretion and transcription from the β cell is regulated by glucose and secreted insulin. Induced transcription (44Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and secretion (45Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) by insulin is mediated by tyrosine kinase signaling through the insulin receptor on the β cell. The marked abnormalities in glucose homeostasis and cell function observed upon removing the insulin receptor selectively from islet β cells in mice have established a central role for this signaling pathway in vivo (46Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that tyrosine kinase/phosphatase signaling controls insulin gene expression within islet β cells by acting upon RIPE3b1.RIPE3b1 binding to the insulin C1 element was dramatically reduced in β cell nuclear extracts incubated at 30 °C, a process blocked by inclusion of a general phosphatase inhibitor (Figs. 1 and2). This same pattern of inactivation was found in extracts prepared from nuclei isolated either with Nonidet P-40 or by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In contrast, binding of PDX-1 or the generally distributed adenovirus-5 major late transcription factor was unaffected under these conditions. Tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (sodium orthovanadate and sodium molybdate), but not serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride, okadaic acid, and microcystin LR), prevented the loss in RIPE3b1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 3). These results indicated that inhibition was caused by dephosphorylation of a tyrosine(s) within the 46-kDa DNA binding subunit of RIPE3b1 by a β cell nuclear phosphatase(s), a proposal strongly supported by our ability to specifically immunoprecipitate this insulin C1-binding protein(s) with the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 monoclonal antibody (Fig.4). However, tyrosine phosphorylation may also influence RIPE3b1 activation by affecting partitioning into the nucleus, as found for the STAT proteins (42Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 47Kessler D.S. Levy D.E. J. Biol.

This raises the question of whether RIPE3b1 activity in glucose-treated β cells is regulated by these same processes.The reduction in RIPE3b1 binding by CIAP and BPP was also prevented by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 3), consistent with results associating tyrosine phosphatase activity with the CIAP enzyme (36Lau K.H. Farley J.R. Baylink D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4653-4660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Shinozaki T. Watanabe H. Arita S. Chigira M. Eur. J.

Interestingly, in contrast to the β cell nuclear extracts, BPP was also less effective at reducing RIPE3b1 binding in the presence of serine/threonine PP1 and PP2A phosphatase inhibitors (see the OA and MLCR lanes in Fig.3 D). This indicates that RIPE3b1 binding is primarily affected by a tyrosine phosphatase(s) in the β nuclear protein-enriched preparation but can be affected by both a serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase(s) in a total cellular BPP. The significance of this observation is under investigation, but it is noteworthy that STAT 1, 3, and 5 protein activity is also regulated by both serine/threonine (53Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E.

Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)).The RIPE3b1 activator appears to be an unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated transcription factor, a conclusion based upon the following observations. First, RIPE3b1 binding activity is only found within islet β cell lines and not within a variety of endocrine (islet α, exocrine, liver, and kidney) and non-endocrine cell types (7Shieh S.Y. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), unlike the more widely distributed tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT and BEF-1 transcription factors. Second, the RIPE3b1 DNA-binding protein is much smaller (∼46 kDa) than other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (STATs, ∼90–115 kDa (64Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 106-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); BEF-1, 98 kDa (43Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Furthermore, STAT protein activity is induced by cytokine and growth factor (e.g. epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor) treatment (65Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and not apparently by glucose (66Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Reifel-Miller A. Rhodes C.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas RIPE3b1 binding is regulated by glucose levels (8Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and not by epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (data not shown). Based upon this reasoning and results demonstrating the importance of islet-enriched transcription factors in pancreatic development and islet cell function, we are working toward isolating the cDNA (gene) encoding for the 46-kDa DNA-binding protein of RIPE3b1. Insulin is a polypeptide hormone that plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis by stimulating the uptake of glucose into cells. Expression of insulin in adults is limited to pancreatic islet β cells primarily because of the recognition, by specific positive-acting transcription factors, of its enhancer region, which is located between nucleotides −340 and −91 relative to the insulin gene transcription start site (1Bramblett D.E.

DISCUSSIONIt is well established that the phosphorylation status of transcription factors, including those involved in insulin gene expression, can play an essential role in activation. The most common site of protein phosphorylation is at serine and threonine residues, and this type of modification has been shown to control the function of a wide variety of transcription factors (34Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). For example, serine/threonine kinase signaling appears to induce PDX-1 activation in high glucose-treated β cells through effects on both nuclear translocation and DNA binding (26Macfarlane W.M.

In contrast, phosphorylation at tyrosine residues within transcription factors is found infrequently, with the only known proteins represented by the signal transducers and activators of transcription (i.e. STAT 1–6) (42Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and nuclear factor 1-like transcription factor (BEF-1 (43Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). However, because many different types of stimuli that affect gene expression also lead to the activation of tyrosine protein kinases, it is likely that other transcription factors will be directly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation.Insulin secretion and transcription from the β cell is regulated by glucose and secreted insulin. Induced transcription (44Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and secretion (45Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) by insulin is mediated by tyrosine kinase signaling through the insulin receptor on the β cell. The marked abnormalities in glucose homeostasis and cell function observed upon removing the insulin receptor selectively from islet β cells in mice have established a central role for this signaling pathway in vivo (46Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that tyrosine kinase/phosphatase signaling controls insulin gene expression within islet β cells by acting upon RIPE3b1.RIPE3b1 binding to the insulin C1 element was dramatically reduced in β cell nuclear extracts incubated at 30 °C, a process blocked by inclusion of a general phosphatase inhibitor (Figs. 1 and2). This same pattern of inactivation was found in extracts prepared from nuclei isolated either with Nonidet P-40 or by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In contrast, binding of PDX-1 or the generally distributed adenovirus-5 major late transcription factor was unaffected under these conditions. Tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (sodium orthovanadate and sodium molybdate), but not serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride, okadaic acid, and microcystin LR), prevented the loss in RIPE3b1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 3). These results indicated that inhibition was caused by dephosphorylation of a tyrosine(s) within the 46-kDa DNA binding subunit of RIPE3b1 by a β cell nuclear phosphatase(s), a proposal strongly supported by our ability to specifically immunoprecipitate this insulin C1-binding protein(s) with the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 monoclonal antibody (Fig.4). However, tyrosine phosphorylation may also influence RIPE3b1 activation by affecting partitioning into the nucleus, as found for the STAT proteins (42Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 47Kessler D.S. Levy D.E. J. Biol.

This raises the question of whether RIPE3b1 activity in glucose-treated β cells is regulated by these same processes.The reduction in RIPE3b1 binding by CIAP and BPP was also prevented by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 3), consistent with results associating tyrosine phosphatase activity with the CIAP enzyme (36Lau K.H.

Interestingly, in contrast to the β cell nuclear extracts, BPP was also less effective at reducing RIPE3b1 binding in the presence of serine/threonine PP1 and PP2A phosphatase inhibitors (see the OA and MLCR lanes in Fig.3 D). This indicates that RIPE3b1 binding is primarily affected by a tyrosine phosphatase(s) in the β nuclear protein-enriched preparation but can be affected by both a serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase(s) in a total cellular BPP. The significance of this observation is under investigation, but it is noteworthy that STAT 1, 3, and 5 protein activity is also regulated by both serine/threonine (53Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E.

Second, the RIPE3b1 DNA-binding protein is much smaller (∼46 kDa) than other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (STATs, ∼90–115 kDa (64Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R.

However, there is no evidence that pcnB-mediated mRNA destabilization decreases protein synthesis, suggesting that polyadenylation may enhance translational efficiency. Using in vitrotranslation by E. coli cell extracts and toeprinting analysis of transcripts encoded by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase genes to investigate this notion, we found no effect of poly(A) tails on protein synthesis. However, we observed that 3′-polyguanylation delayed the chemical decay of CAT mRNA and, even more dramatically, increased the ability of CAT mRNA to produce enzymatically active full-length protein in 30 S E. coli cell fractions. This resulted from interference with the primary mechanism for inactivation of CAT transcript function in cell extracts, which occurred by 3′-exonucleolytic degradation rather than endonucleolytic fragmentation by RNase E. Using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase to install poly(G) tails on mRNAs transcribed from polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA templates, we observed sharply increased synthesis of active proteins in vitro in coupled transcription/translation reactions. The ability of poly(G) tails to functionally stabilize transcripts from polymerase chain reaction-generated templates allows proteins encoded by translational open reading frames on genomic DNA or cDNA to be synthesized directly and efficiently in vitro.

The ability of poly(G) tails to functionally stabilize transcripts from polymerase chain reaction-generated templates allows proteins encoded by translational open reading frames on genomic DNA or cDNA to be synthesized directly and efficiently in vitro. polynucleotide phosphorylase RNA polymerase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polymerase chain reaction horseradish peroxidase open reading frame guanosine pentaphosphate synthetase I telomere binding protein N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Polyadenylation of RNA at the 3′-end is now known to occur in prokaryotic organisms as in eukaryotes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cohen S.N.

The addition of poly(A) tails to bacterial RNA leads to accelerated RNA degradation by polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase)1 (3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. J. Biol.

However, the only biological consequence of slowing RNA decay by impeding polyadenylation demonstrated thus far is altered control of plasmid DNA replication (6Xu F. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli pcnB mutants that are deficient in poly(A) polymerase I (7Cao G.J. Sarkar N. Proc. Natl.

Although the failure to add poly(A) tails can also stabilize a variety of mRNA species in E. coli (8O'Hara E.B. Chekanova J.A. Ingle C.A. Kushner Z.R. Peters E. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), enhanced synthesis of proteins encoded by these RNAs has not been reported in pcnBmutant bacteria, raising the possibility that poly(A) tails may, while accelerating the decay of mRNAs, also lead to a compensatory increase in translational efficiency. During experiments aimed at testing the above idea by analyzing the effects of poly(A) tails and other types of 3′-transcript ends on RNA translation in E. coli cell extracts, we observed surprisingly that short tracts of G nucleotides at 3′ termini interfere with the ribonucleolytic step responsible for inactivation of the ability of mRNA to function in translation in vitro, enabling the use of poly(G) tails as a tool to investigate mechanisms of mRNA functional decay. Our results indicate that poly(G) tails prolong mRNA functional half-life in E. coli extracts by interfering with 3′–5′-degradation, implying that inactivation of mRNA function occurred by this process rather than by endonucleolytic fragmentation during in vitro translation. The ability of poly(G) tails to functionally stabilize mRNA, together with our ancillary discovery of a method for efficiently installing poly(G) tails on transcripts synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase from polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA templates, has yielded an approach for the in vitrosynthesis of proteins encoded by translational open reading frame sequences on genomic DNA or uncloned cDNA. E. coli B strain BL21 (F −, hsdS, gal, OmpT−) was initially used for S-30 preparation when mRNAs encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and LacZα were used in in vitro translation. SL119 (11Lesley S.A. Brow M.A. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2632-2638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an recD (12Biek D.P. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 594-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) derivative of BL21, was used to prepare S-30 for a coupled transcription/translation system. For the preparation of 30 S ribosomal subunits, E. coli K12 strain CA244 (lacZ, trp, relA, spoT) (13Brenner S. Beckwith J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 629-637Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used. All plasmids were maintained in E. coli DH5α (supE44,hsdR17, recA1, endA1,gyrA96, thi-1,Δ(lacIZYA-argF)U169, deoR(φ80dlacΔ (lacZ)M15)) (14Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8098) Google Scholar). pET3a-α was constructed by amplifying the DNA sequence encoding the LacZα fragment (amino acids 1–94) from chromosomal DNA ofE. coli strain N3433 (lacZ43, relA, spoT, thi-1) (15Goldblum K. Apirion D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 128-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 5′-α (5′-ACAGGATCCATGACCATGATTACGGAT) and 3′-α (5′-ACAGGATCCGTGCATCTGCCAGTTTGA) and cloning into the BamHI site of pET3a (Novagen). pET3a-CAT was constructed by amplifying the CAT gene from pACYC184 (16Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 5′-CAT (5′-ACAGGATCCAGGAGGCTCGAGATGGAGAAAAAAATCACTGGA) and 3′-CAT (5′-ACAGGATCCTTACGCCCCGCCCTGCCACTC) and cloning them into theBamHI site of pET3a. Plasmid pLAC-RNE2 is a derivative of pPM30 (17Meacock P.A. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1980; 20: 529-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) that directs the conditional synthesis of a full-length carboxyl-terminal-tagged form of E. coli RNase E under the control of the lacUV5 promoter. A hexahistidine-affinity tag was inserted right before the stop codon of the RNase E gene, and a stronger ribosome binding sequence was incorporated upstream of the RNase E coding sequence (5′-GCGGCCGCAGGAGGTTACGATG, the ribosome binding sequence is underlined and the start codon is in bold type). Plasmid pGL3Basic was purchased from Promega, Madison, WI, and pJSE371 was a gift from Dr. George Jones (18Jones G.H. Bibb M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pTH90 was a gift from Dr. Alexander von Gabain (19Sohlberg B. Lundberg U. Hartl F.-U. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T7 RNA polymerase, and the restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. The oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [3H]chloramphenicol (38.9 Ci/mmol), and ECL detection kit were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-T7·tag antibody horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate and T7·tag affinity purification kit were from Novagen. M1 antibody was from Eastman Kodak Co., and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP was from Promega. Polyclonal antibodies against E. coli PNPase were a gift from Dr. A. J. Carpousis. Other chemicals and tRNAs were purchased from Sigma. An E. coli-coupled transcription/translation system (S-30) was prepared from E. coli strain BL21 essentially as described by Lesleyet al. (11Lesley S.A. Brow M.A. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2632-2638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mRNAs containing 20 A tails were used to determine the optimal concentration of CAT and LacZαmRNA in reactions. Optimal protein production was observed at 120 nm mRNA for both mRNAs. Coupled transcription/translation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in reaction mixtures containing 1 μg of agarose gel-purified DNA, unless otherwise indicated. All mRNAs used in this study were synthesized using the MEGAscript™ T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and PCR DNA as a template according to the manufacturer's instructions. 9 S ribosomal RNA transcript was synthesized fromHaeIII-cut plasmid pTH90 using the MEGAshortscript™ T7 kit (Ambion). RNA was purified from 6% acrylamide gel containing 8m urea. For in vitro synthesis of CAT and LacZα mRNAs containing no 3′-additions or containing A20, A40, or G20 in vitro, PCR-generated DNAs were prepared using 5′-primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG) and 3′-primer (5′(none, C20, T20, or T40)-AAGGCTGTTAGCAGCCGGATCC) and pET3a-α or pET3a-CAT as template. PCR DNAs for coupled transcription/translation reactions were prepared as follows. First, for PCR DNAs containing CAT coding region, 5′-primer that installs the T7 promoter with different lengths of extra base pairs upstream of the T7 promoter and 3′-primer that installs 3′-tails were used to amplify CAT coding region from pET3a-CAT. The 5′-primer was 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG with extra base pairs at the 5′ that are 20 random nucleotides or different lengths of upstream sequence of the T7 promoter present in pET3a-CAT plasmid (AGATCTCGATCCCGCGAAAT), and the 3′-primer was 5′ (complementary sequence of tails)-TTACGCCCCGCCCTGCCA (the stop codon is in bold type). Second, for PCR DNAs containing firefly luciferase gene, the 5′-primer was 5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGCCACCATGGAAGACGCCA (the consensus T7 promoter is underlined, and the start codon is in bold type), 3′-primers were 5′(complementary sequence of tails)-TTACACGGCGATCTTTCCGCC (the stop codon is in bold type), and the template was pGL3Basic. Third, for PCR DNAs containing G pentaphosphate synthetase I (GPSI), 5′-primer was 5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGG (the consensus T7 promoter is underlined), 3′-primer was 5′(complementary sequence of tails)-TACGGGACGTCACTGCTC (stop codon is in bold type), and template was pJSE371. Fourth, the coding region of telomere-binding protein (TP) 2Bao, K. and Cohen, S. N. (2001) Genes Dev. 15, in press. was amplified from the Streptomyces rochei chromosome using 5′-primer (5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGTGGACTCGATCGGAGACGG (the consensus T7 promoter is underlined and the start codon is in bold type) and 3′-primers (5′(complementary sequence of tails)-CTA CTTGTCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCCAGCTGGATCTCGATCTG, the stop codon is in bold type and the sequence for FLAG·tag is underlined). S1-depleted 30 S was prepared by the procedure published by Tal et al. (20Tal M. Aviram M. Kanarek A. Weiss A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 281: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified 30 S was dialyzed against a low strength buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) followed by precipitation of S1-depleted 30 S. S1 protein is the largest of all 30 S ribosomal proteins, and removal of S1 protein in 30 S was confirmed by visualizing 30 S subunit ribosomal proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gel (data not shown here). 30 S ribosomal subunits were prepared essentially as described by Moazed et al. (21Moazed D. Stern S. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) except that frozen E. coli CA244 cells were opened by passing them through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. twice, and a 70 S ribosome pellet was washed and resuspended twice in buffer B before being dialyzed against buffer C. Toeprinting assay was performed as described by Ringquist et al. (22Ringquist S. MacDonald M. Gibson T. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10254-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 1 unit/reaction. The primers CAT-TP (5′-GGATCCGCGACCCATTTG) and α-TP (5′-GGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGA), which are complementary to CAT and LacZα transcripts, respectively, were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified from 15% acrylamide containing 8 m urea. We determined optimal conditions for binding of the 30 S ribosomal subunits to mRNA using reverse transcriptase amounts ranging from 0 to 1.6 units/reaction and mRNA to primer ratios from 0.25 to 1 (data not shown here). We then tested CAT mRNAs in this assay. CAT activity was determined essentially as described by Nielsen et al. (23Nielsen D.A. Chang T.C. Shapiro D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RNase E cleavage was assayed as described by McDowall et al. (24McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.-W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Luciferase assay was performed according to manufacturer's instructions, and the enzymatic activity was measured in a TD-20e luminometer (Turner). E. coli RNase E was purified from N3433 cells containing pLAC-RNE2 using the His·Bind purification kit (Novagen). The enzyme was eluted from columns using 80 mm imidazole, concentrated, and stored as described previously (24McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.-W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CAT protein was purified from BL21 (DE3) harboring pET3a-CAT after a 1-h induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside using the T7·tag purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentration was calculated using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 as described by Sedmak and Grossberg (25Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar) and using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Prestained protein molecular weight standards from Life Technologies were used as size markers. Proteins were run on a 10% Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described by Schägger and von Jagow (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), and gels were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose filter and probed as described by Hagège and Cohen (27Hagège J.M. Cohen S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1077-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The dilutions used for antibodies were 1:10,000 for anti-T7·tag-HRP, 1:1000 for anti-FLAG (M2), and 1:5000 for anti-PNPase, anti-mouse IgG-HRP, and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP. When blots were used for reprobing they were stripped at 50 °C for 30 min with occasional agitation in 200 ml of stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7) followed by 2× wash in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 for 20 min. In E. coli, translation begins on nascent mRNA during the course of its synthesis (28Stent G.S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond B. Biol. Sci. 1966; 164: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), so that any translational enhancement by 3′-poly(A) additions would necessarily be restricted to already completed transcripts. Accordingly, we tested the ability of full-length mRNA containing or lacking poly(A) tails to generate protein in vitro. Transcripts encoding CAT or the α fragment of the β-galactosidase (LacZ) protein uniformly labeled with [32P]UTP were synthesized in vitro by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase using PCR-generated DNA fragments as template (see “Experimental Procedures”). The transcripts, which contained 0, 20, or 40 adenosine (A) nucleotides at the 3′-end were gel-purified and added to an E. coli cell extract-based reaction mixture for in vitro translation. Transcripts containing twenty 3′-G nucleotides were used as controls. The mRNAs chosen for translation were relatively small (417 and 807 nucleotides for α and CAT, respectively), and the proteins they encode are well characterized. Within 2 min after the addition of CAT or α-mRNA to in vitro translation reaction mixtures, poly(A) tails 20 or 40 nucleotides in length had been degraded, and decay of primary transcripts that initially had contained poly(A) tails proceeded at the same rate as decay of nonadenylated RNA (Fig.1, A–D). Consistent with the rapidity of poly(A) tail removal in these E. coli cell extracts, we did not detect an effect of poly(A) tails on overall CAT or LacZα protein synthesis (Fig. 1, E andF). However, we observed during these experiments that poly(G) tails, which had been added to CAT-encoding transcripts as a control, dramatically enhanced the production of CAT and LacZα protein in vitro (Fig. 1, E andF). Initiation of polypeptide chains is known to be the rate-limiting step in mRNA translation (29McCarthy J.E. Brimacombe R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 402-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30Calogero R.A. Pon C.L. Canonaco M.A. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6427-6431Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Dreyfus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Toeprinting assays, which measure the rate of formation of translation initiation complexes between mRNA and 30 S ribosomal subunits, have proved useful in evaluating factors that affect translation initiation (22Ringquist S. MacDonald M. Gibson T. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10254-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that neither poly(A) tails nor primary transcripts were detectably degraded over a 30-min period in vitro in toeprinting assay mixtures that used highly purified ribosomes and reverse transcriptase, allowing the use of toeprinting to test for the possible enhancement of translation efficiency by poly(A) tails. As seen in Fig.2 A, a toeprint signal produced by the binding of CAT mRNA to 30 S ribosomal subunits was detected at a characteristic position (32Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), 15 nucleotides from the 5′-most nucleotide of the start codon. CAT transcripts entirely lacking poly(A) tails or containing tails of 40 As showed similar binding efficiency to 30 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2 B), indicating that 3′-polyadenylation has no detectable effect on the initiation of translation. Additionally, whereas ribosomes depleted of S1, which binds to poly(A) tails and has been speculated to play a role in translation by recruiting the 30 S subunit to poly(A)-tailed mRNA (33Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), produced an expected decrease in toeprint signal (34Moll I. Resch A. Bläsi U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the magnitude of the decrease was unaffected by the presence or absence of poly(A) tails (Fig. 2). As seen in Fig. 1, enhancement of CAT protein synthesis in vitro by 3′-polyguanylation is associated with retardation of CAT mRNA chemical decay. However, the effect of poly(G) tails on CAT mRNA functional half-life as reflected by the production of active CAT and LacZα proteins was 4–6 times greater than their effect on the chemical decay of mRNA (cf. Fig. 1, C andD versus E and F). This finding suggested that poly(G) tails might prove useful in investigating the mechanisms involved in mRNA functional decay. The initial step in the chemical decay of a variety of E. coli mRNAs is endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase E, the principal endonuclease of E. coli (for reviews, see Refs. 35Steege D.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholarand 36Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and poly(G) previously has been found not to affect such cleavage (37Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas RNase E cleavage is also the step that initiates chemical and functional decay of RNA I (38Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 39Bouvet P. Belasco J.G. Nature. 1992; 360: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), a 108-nucleotide antisense repressor of replication of ColE1-type plasmids, we can find no published evidence that RNase E cleavage determines the functional half-life of mRNA in E. coli cells. To the contrary, earlier work by Ono and Kuwano (40Ono M. Kuwano M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) showed that mutation of theE. coli gene now known to encode RNase E prolongs the chemical half-life of bulk mRNA but has no effect on mRNA functional half-life. As seen in Fig. 3, analysis of CAT protein produced by mRNA incubated with E. coli cell extracts for various lengths of time provided evidence that functional decay of CAT mRNA in 30 S cell fractions is not mediated by endonucleolytic cleavage. Western blot analysis of N-terminal T7-epitope-tagged CAT protein showed that CAT transcripts lacking poly(G) tails generated protein that was slightly shorter in length than the CAT protein produced by polyguanylated transcripts (Fig.3 B) and that the ability of poly(G) tails to reverse transcript truncation was directly related to their ability to increase the production of functional CAT protein. This result, taken together with evidence that poly(G) tails have a greater effect on CAT biochemical activity than nontailed transcripts (Fig. 3 A), implies that inactive C-terminally truncated CAT proteins were made in these reaction mixtures by 3′ terminally truncated mRNA decay intermediates, and consequently that functional inactivation of CAT transcripts had occurred by degradation proceeding from the 3′-mRNA end. Could these results be due to a possible absence of active RNase E in the 30 S cell extract fractions used for transcription/translation reactions? As seen in Fig. 4A, endonuclease fragmentation of CAT mRNA was observed in these reaction mixtures, and the pattern and rate of fragmentation was unchanged by poly(G) tails. Moreover, the fragmentation pattern was similar to that produced by digestion of CAT mRNA by purified RNase E implying that endogenous RNase E is present and active in 30 S fractions. This was shown directly by using 9 S ribosomal RNA, a 236-nucleotide transcript whose site-specific cleavage by RNase E has been extensively characterized. As seen in Fig. 4 B, incubation of the 236-nucleotide 9 S transcript in transcription/translation reaction generated the 206-nucleotide and 126-nucleotide fragments characteristically produced by RNase E cleavage. The additional presence of exonucleolytic activity in these extracts was shown by evidence that fragments generated by RNase E cleavage of 9 S RNA were themselves degraded (Fig. 4 B) and that the combined radioactivity detected in full-length 9 S RNA and identifiable RNase E-generated fragments of this substrate diminished with time (69% remained after 10 min). Further experiments presented in Fig. 4 A specifically confirmed earlier evidence (37Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that the rate and pattern of cleavage of CAT mRNA by purified RNase E is not affected by the presence of a 3′-tract of G nucleotides on the substrate (cf. 20G versus 20A). The ability of poly(G) tails to significantly protect mRNA from functional decay during in vitro protein synthesis suggested that the installation of poly(G) tails onto mRNA molecules might be useful as a strategy for increasing the yield of active protein in coupled transcription/translation reactions in vitro. If so, we hypothesized, poly(G)-tailed transcripts made by in vitrotranscription of PCR-generated templates containing genomic open reading frames (ORFs) potentially could facilitate the synthesis of functional proteins encoded by genes on unfractionated DNA templates. The approach we devised to test this idea involved the synthesis of run-off CAT gene transcripts by the highly efficient bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (41Iost I. Guillerez J. Dreyfus M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The 5′-primer used to generate the template by PCR installs the bacteriophage T7 promoter (42Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) near the 5′-end of the template, and the 3′-primer installs a 20-nucleotide stretch of poly(C) at the template's 3′-end. This was expected to lead to synthesis of homopolymeric G tails on T7-generated transcripts. The E. coli cell extracts employed for these experiments were prepared from an exodeoxyribonuclease-deficient (recD) strain (SL119) to minimize degradation of linear DNA templates. Using the coupled transcription/translation system described above, no chemical or functional stabilization of CAT mRNA by poly(G) tails was observed. This raised the possibility that synthesis of poly(G)-tailed transcripts by T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) was not occurring in these E. coli cell extracts, consistent with earlier evidence (11Lesley S.A. Brow M.A. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2632-2638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that transcription of PCR-generated DNA fragments containing the T7 promoter is mediated by the E. coli RNAP rather than by T7 RNAP in coupled transcription/translation reaction mixtures. In such a case, the inability of the E. colienzyme to efficiently transcribe homopolymer sequences (43Jacques J.P. Kolakofsky D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) could lead to the absence of poly(G) tails on transcripts. This interpretation was tested and confirmed by the finding that the addition of rifampicin, an inhibitor of E. coli RNAP but not of T7 RNAP (44Sippel A. Hartmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 157: 218-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), to reaction mixtures sharply decreased protein production in vitro (Fig. 5 A). However, in contrast to our results using PCR-generated templates, Nevin and Pratt (45Nevin D.E. Pratt J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) observed that linearized plasmid DNA containing the T7 promoter was efficiently transcribed in E. coli cell extracts in the presence of rifampicin. We compared the sequence of Nevin and Pratt's template with ours and found that theirs contained additional base pairs 5′ to the T7 promoter. That these nucleotides are crucial to the ability of the T7 RNAP to initiate transcription on linear DNA templates is shown in Fig. 5. Whereas rifampicin-independent transcription occurred on a template containing 17 base pairs 5′ to the T7 promoter (i.e. the restriction endonuclease-generatedBglII-EcoRV DNA fragment), a PCR-generated DNA fragment that included the same promoter but lacked additional upstream base pairs failed to function as a template for T7 RNAP. Further experiments showed that CAT protein synthesis encoded by transcripts generated by the E. coli RNAP (i.e.those made in the absence of rifampicin) decreased as the length of the template increased (Fig. 5 A). Also, as few as 5 base pairs upstream of the T7 promoter on the template DNA fragment were sufficient to promote rifampicin-independent synthesis of CAT to a level that was much higher than that achieved by E. coliRNAP (Fig. 5, C and D). This effect was independent of the nucleotide sequence of the 5′ base pairs (the 20-base-pair natural sequence versus randomly inserted base pairs) (Fig. 5 C, N20) and was due specifically to transcription by T7 RNAP (Fig. 5 D). PCR-generated CAT gene templates containing the T7 promoter and 5 upstream base pairs plus 3′-sequences that generate different types of tails on the transcripts encoded by these templates (Fig. 6,A and B) were used for the synthesis of active CAT protein in vitro during coupled transcription/translation. As shown, the number of G nucleotides required for the maximum yield of translation product peaked at 15. Installation of 15 G nucleotides internal to the transcript and 3′ to the ORF yielded about 70% of the protein production observed with 15 G nucleotides at the 3′ terminus. Whereas the same length of homopolymeric C nucleotides also increased the production of functional CAT protein to 30–60 μg/ml of the reaction (Fig. 6 C), this effect was not observed for other mRNAs we tested. The observed steady state level and rate of decay for CAT mRNA containing poly(G) and poly(C) tails (Fig. 6,D–G) correlated well with the effects of homopolymeric additions on CAT protein produced by transcription/translation of templates synthesized by PCR. Poly(G) tails also increased the yield in coupled transcription/translation reactions of proteins specified by other PCR-generated templates. These included firefly luciferase andStreptomyces chromosomal ORFs encoding GPSI or a 21-kDa S. rochei telomere binding protein2 (Fig. 7). The effect of 3′-polyguanylation on the synthesis of biologically active 80-kDa GPSI by poly(G) tails was 2-fold, whereas production of the 21-kDa TP was increased 22-fold by the poly(G) tail. For these proteins, as well as for luciferase and CAT, the extent of functional stabilization of transcripts by poly(G) was inversely related to transcript length. Our investigations of a possible effect of poly(A) tails of mRNA on bacterial mRNA translation revealed no evidence that 3′-polyadenylation alters the ability of transcripts to produce proteins in vitro. However, we observed that 3′-poly(G) additions to transcripts can increase the chemical and, even more dramatically, the functional half-life of mRNA in E. coli cell extracts, yielding up to an 80-fold increase in coupled transcription/translation reaction during 1-h incubations (Fig.6 B). Guanine-rich nucleic acid segments are known to form a structure termed a “G quartet” (46Zimmerman S.B. Cohen G.H. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 92: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), which commonly is found within telomeres. It was shown previously that G tails inhibit the binding and action of PNPase (5Lisitsky I. Schuster G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), one of two major 3′- to 5′-exonucleases of E. coli. However, poly(G) tails do not affect cleavage by RNase E (37Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the principal endoribonuclease of E. coli, and in our experiments did not alter the rate or pattern of fragmentation of CAT mRNA by RNase E present in the reaction mixtures used for in vitro protein synthesis. Instead, they protected against the C-terminal truncation of protein encoded by the mRNA. Whereas there is substantial evidence that RNase E initiates the chemical decayin vivo of a variety of mRNAs (for reviews, see Refs. 35Steege D.A. RNA. 2000; 6: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholarand 36Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and both the chemical and functional decay of RNA I (38Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 39Bouvet P. Belasco J.G. Nature. 1992; 360: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), published evidence for an effect of RNase E cleavage on the functional half-life of mRNA in E. coli cells is lacking. Our conclusion that functional inactivation of CAT mRNA in E. coli cell extracts occurs by a mechanism other than endonucleolytic cleavage is consistent with the finding that mutation of the E. coli rne (formerly known as ams) gene affects bulk mRNA half-life in vivo but not functional decay (40Ono M. Kuwano M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, interference by poly(G) tails with 3′- to 5′-exonucleolytic decay may not entirely explain their effect on the functional inactivation of mRNAs, as the synthesis of active CAT protein paradoxically was observed to decrease when the length of the tail extended past 15 nucleotides. Additionally, the effect of poly(G) tails on protein synthesis decreased as the length of the primary transcript increased, suggesting that functional decay of CAT mRNAin vitro may not be entirely independent of endonucleolytic cleavage. We found during our investigations that at least five nonspecific base pairs 5′ to the bacteriophage T7 promoter is required for efficient transcription by T7 RNAP. This effect and also the effect of poly(G) tails on mRNA functional half-life were observed for a commercially available transcription/translation reaction mixture (PROTEINscript-PRO™, Ambion) as well as for the E. colicell extracts we prepared. Using as template a DNA that contained the CAT ORF, a 5′-primer that installed the T7 promoter and additional base pairs at the 5′-end of the PCR-generated CAT ORF-containing template, and a 3′-primer that installed a poly(G) tail on run-off transcripts synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase, our reaction mixtures yielded a level of protein that was comparable with that reported for in vitro protein synthesis systems employing genes cloned on circular plasmid DNA (47Kim D.M.

This leads to definitive functional differences between male and female gametes, causing parthenogenetic/gynogenetic and androgenetic embryos, which consist, respectively, of two sets of maternal or paternal genomes.

Nature. 1991; 349: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) genes were first identified as imprinted genes in 1991, around 40 of these types of genes have been identified. However, the genes identified thus far constitute only a small portion of the number of imprinted genes, which is estimated to be 1–2% of all genes. Recently, an inclusive attempt was made to identify imprinted genes by the subtraction method using parthenogenetic and androgenetic mouse embryos (16Kaneko-Ishino T. Kuroiwa Y. Miyoshi N. Kohda T.

This limited success in identifying genes may suggest that the expression of some imprinted genes is unregulated in uniparental embryos. The U2afbp-rs gene is a paternally expressed imprinted gene located on mouse chromosome 11 (19–21). This gene was identified by a systematic screening performed using a restriction landmark genome scanning procedure for loci subject to imprinted methylation (19Hatada I. Hayashizaki Y. Hirotsune S.

The gene is expressed in all tissues throughout development, with expression restricted to the paternal allele and predominantly in the brain of the adult mouse (21Hayashizaki Y. Shibata H. Hirotsune S. Sugino H. Okazaki Y. Sasaki N. Hirose K. Imoto H. Okuizumi H. Muramatsu M. Komatsubara H. Shiroishi T. Moriwaki K. Katsuki M. Hatano N. Sasaki H. Ueda T. Mise N. Takagi N. Plass C. Chapman V.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but its function is unknown. In this study, we show that the paternally expressed U2afbp-rs gene is expressed abundantly from maternal alleles in parthenogenetic mouse fetuses. This suggests that the parental genome is necessary for establishing and/or maintaining the paternal expression of the gene. B6CBF1 (C57BL/6N × CBA) mice were used as oocyte and sperm donors to produce embryos. Oocytes at metaphase II were collected from superovulated mice and artificially activated with SrCl2 (Sr2+) (22Bos-Mikich A. Swann K. Whittingham D.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,23Bos-Mikich A. Whittingham D.G. Jones K.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To produce diploid parthenogenetic embryos, during the culture in Sr2+ medium and following the first 4 h of culture in M16 medium, 5 µg/ml cytochalasin B was added to these media to inhibit a second polar body extrusion. Androgenetic embryos were produced by in vitro fertilization of enucleated oocytes according to the procedure reported previously (24Kono T. Sotomaru Y. Sato Y. Nakahara T. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 34: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When required, pronuclear transfer (25Kono T. Jones T.K. Bos-Mikich A. Whittingham D.G. Carroll J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was performed to produce diploid androgenones in monospermic embryos. Control biparental embryos were produced byin vitro fertilization. The obtained blastocysts were transferred to the uterine horns of CD-1 females on day 3 of pseudopregnancy (2.5 days postcoitum), and fetuses were recovered at day 9.5 of gestation. Total RNA was isolated from the fetuses at day 9.5 of gestation using an SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). The first strand of cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA from each fetus by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was subjected to PCR, which was carried out in a 50-µl reaction buffer containing 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Japan), 1 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 250 µm dNTPs. The amplification consisted of a total of 35 cycles at 95, 63, and 72 °C, respectively, for 60 s in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primers used were 5′-TACCACAGATAACCACGGATACCTG-3′ and 5′-ATAGGCCTGCCCATGCAGTTA-3′. Quantitative analysis of gene expression was performed by means of real-time quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). By adding a fluorescently labeled probe (5′-GGATAACTGGATAGACGGATAACTGCGCA -3′) to the PCR reaction mixture, the quantity of PCR products was detected by monitoring the luminous intensity with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To identify the activated allele of the U2afbp-rs gene, biparental and parthenogenetic embryos were constructed in which these embryos contained diploid genomes from B6CBF1 and JF1 mice, respectively. Polymorphisms of the U2afbp-rs gene between B6CBF1 and JF1 mice were detected by restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism analysis using HpaII (Fig.1). In an upstream CpG island (regions I, II, and IV) and the ORF (region III) of the U2afbp-rs gene (26Shibata H. Ueda T. Kamiya M. Yoshiki A. Kusakabe M. Plass C. Held W.A. Sunahara S. Katsuki M. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Genomics. 1997; 44: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in parthenogenetic and normal biparental fetuses, the methylation pattern was analyzed by Southern hybridization using genome DNAs that had been digested by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes (Fig. 1). Extracted genome DNAs were digested by DraI and HindIII to obtain DNA fragments containing the CpG islands or byEcoT14I and PshBI for ORF. Then the DNA fragments were digested by HpaII or HhaI and subjected to electrophoresis (1.5% NuSieve:agarose (3:1)). The DNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+) and introduced into Southern hybridization. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 60 °C using AlkPhos Direct Labeling Reagent (RPN3680) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes used were derived from PCR products using primer sets of 5′-GGTTTACCTGGTAAAGCCCTT-3′ and 5′-ATAGGCCTGCCCATGCAGTTA-3′ for the CpG island and 5′-AAGATGGTACGCAGGACGAC-3′ and 5′-TTTGTGGACCTGGACTGCTG-3′ for the ORF and alkaline phosphatase labeled by the reagent. The hybridized membrane was treated with CDP-Star (RPN3682) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the intensity of the band was measured by an LAS1000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan). Chromatin conformation of the U2afbp-rs gene in parthenogenetic and control biparental fetuses was determined by DNase-I hypersensitivity assay, usingDraI-EcoRI fragments of the genome DNAs (Fig. 1). Extracted genome DNAs were treated with a solution containing 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 units/ml DNase-I at 4 °C for 5 min, as described previously (6Sasaki H. Jones P.A. Chaillet J.R. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Barton S.C. Reik W. Surani M.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1843-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The DNAs were then digested with DraI and EcoRI and introduced into Southern hybridization, using the same probe for methylation analysis of the promoter region. To confirm that the paternal expression of U2afbp-rs is maintained in uniparental fetuses, we first examined the expression of the U2afbp-rs gene in each parthenogenetic and androgenetic fetus at 9.5 days by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of the U2afbp-rs gene was unexpectedly detected in 38 of 39 parthenogenetic fetuses. The expression level was determined to be roughly 10–50% of that in the control biparental fetuses. Analysis by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, which is able to detect the precise expression level in an individual fetus, showed that expression of theU2afbp-rs gene by parthenogenetic fetuses ranged from 31 to 134% (mean 88%) of that in controls (56–124%, Fig.2). In the controls (without RT), no signal of PCR product was detected. The expression allele was detected using parthenogenones constructed from JF1 and B6CBF1 mouse genomes that contain polymorphic sequences in the exon region between the strains (Fig. 3). After digestion of the RT-PCR products (243 bp) with HpaII, two bands (194 bp for B6CBF1 and 177 bp for JF1 alleles) were detected, showing that the gene was expressed from both alleles. It was also confirmed that, in the control biparental fetuses, the gene was not expressed from the maternal allele. These results suggest that the regulation mechanism for paternal specific expression of the U2afbp-rsgene is not established in parthenogenetic fetuses. The quantitative analysis in androgenetic fetuses, which have two paternal alleles, showed that expression of the U2afbp-rs gene was almost equal (mean 83%, 45–109%) to that in the controls (Fig. 2), suggesting the presence of an underlying dose-compensation mechanism.Figure 3The expression allele of theU2afbp-rs gene was analyzed by restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism analysis in biparental and parthenogenetic fetuses at day 9.5 of gestation.The marker used was a 25-bp DNA Step Ladder (Promega, G4511). RT-PCR products (237 bp) from B6CBF1 and JF1 alleles were, respectively, digested into 194- and 177-bp fragments by HpaII. In B6CBF1 × JF1 fetuses, expression was theoretically detected only from paternal JF1-derived alleles. In parthenogenetic fetuses, which contained diploid genomes from both B6CBF1 and JF1 mice, gene expression was detected from both alleles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Generally, parental expression of imprinting genes is closely related to the methylation level of the CpG islands in the promoter regions (6Sasaki H.

Cell. 1993; 73: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not this phenomenon is seen in the expression of the U2afbp-rs in parthenogenetic fetuses, the methylation levels in the promoter and ORF regions of theU2afbp-rs gene were analyzed by Southern blot analysis (Fig.4, a and b). When the regions are undermethylated, 1317-bpDraI-HindIII fragments for the promoter and 1207-bp EcoT14I-PshBI fragments for the ORF are digested into fragments of 252 bp by HpaII, 290 bp byHhaI, and 635 bp by HpaII, respectively.MspI digestion of the regions confirmed a positive effect of the HpaII digestion. These results show that in both regions in the control fetuses, two bands of digested and nondigested fragments, using HpaII and/or HhaI were formed, suggesting that only the maternal alleles were possibly hemimethylated. However, in the parthenogenetic fetuses, no sequence was digested in the HpaII nor in the HhaI site, indicating that both alleles were entirely hypermethylated despite considerable expression of the gene. This suggests that other regulation factors may be involved in the disruption of the regulated expression of theU2afbp-rs gene in the parthenogenetic mouse fetuses. Because chromatin structure is also related to gene expression (27Shibata H. Yoshino K. Sunahara S. Gondo Y. Katsuki M. Ueda T. Kamiya M. Muramatsu M. Murakami Y. Kalcheva I. Plass C. Chapman V.M. Hayashizaki Y. Genomics. 1996; 35: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,28Feri R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 14390-14397Google Scholar), chromatin conformation of the U2afbp-rs gene was determined by the DNase-I hypersensitivity assay (Fig.5). The DNase-I hypersensitive sites in the DraI-EcoRI fragment were detected in both control and parthenogenetic fetuses (arrowheads in Fig. 5) when the fragments were digested by more than 20 units/ml DNase-I. The status of DNase-I hypersensitive sites of parthenogenetic fetuses was similar to that of the controls, suggesting that the chromosomes of the parthenogenetic fetuses have an open conformation. This perhaps caused the unregulated expression of the U2afbp-rs gene in the parthenogenetic fetuses. We reported previously that expressions of mouse paternally expressed imprinted genes Peg1/Mest (16Kaneko-Ishino T. Kuroiwa Y. Miyoshi N. Kohda T. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Viville S. Barton S.C.

Further analysis by real-time quantitative RT-PCR confirmed parental specific expression of theIgf2 gene in both the parthenogenetic and androgenetic fetuses (31Sotomaru Y. Katsuzawa Y. Domeki I. Kono T. J. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 47: 139-144Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These previously published observations show that parental expression of imprinted genes is generally maintained in uniparental fetuses. The current study demonstrated, however, that anti-theoretical gene expression of the paternally expressed imprinted gene U2afbp-rs is caused in the parthenogenetic fetuses. The expression reached an average level of 88%, ranging from 31 to 134% of that in biparental fetuses. Notably, the expression occurred at a level very different from that of leakage, suggesting that both maternal and paternal alleles are necessary for the regulated parentally specific expression of imprinted genes.U2afbp-rs was identified by the restriction landmark genome scanning procedure based on loci subject, but the subtraction method (16Kaneko-Ishino T.

During oocyte growth, the maternal genome is epigenetically modified, and maternally specific expression patterns of imprinted genes are established as a result of the primary imprinting. To demonstrate this, we obtained parthenogenetic mouse fetuses developed from constructed oocytes that contained nongrowing and fully grown oocyte-derived genomes that were derived from immature oocytes at diplotene stage and mature oocytes at metaphase II, respectively. The experiments clearly demonstrated that these fetuses develop to day 13.5 of gestation (32Kono T. Obata Y. Yoshimzu T. Nakahara T. Carroll J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and paternally expressed imprinted genes are expressed from the nongrowing oocyte alleles (30Obata Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Koide T. Takai Y. Ueda T. Domeki I. Shiroishi T. Ishino F. Kono T. Development. 1998; 125: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been found thatU2afbp-rs is activated in the nongrowing oocyte allele in such parthenogenetic fetuses 2Y. Obata and T. Kono, unpublished data.. Before fertilization, the maternal allele of the U2afbp-rs gene has been imprinted to be repressed by the methylation of the CpG island in specific sites of its promoter regions (regions II and IV). A wide range of methylation occurs in the promoter region (region I) at the two-cell stage. This methylation may play a crucial role in determining allele-specific expression, although maternal expression was maintained at later stages (26Shibata H. Ueda T. Kamiya M. Yoshiki A. Kusakabe M. Plass C. Held W.A. Sunahara S. Katsuki M. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Genomics. 1997; 44: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The question raised by the present results is whether the expression of U2afbp-rs from maternal alleles is associated with the demethylation of the regulatory region. Analysis of methylation status by Southern hybridization and HpaII-PCR (data not shown) showed that the region was hypermethylated and that expression of the U2afbp-rs gene was from the maternal allele in the control fetuses. A previous report (33Shemer R. Birger Y. Dean W.L. Reik W. Riggs A.D. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggested that methylation levels in imprinted genes Igf2 (14DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A.

In this study of theU2afbp-rs gene in parthenogenetic and androgenetic fetuses, the dose compensation was also observed in the methylation level but not in the expression level. To obtain further insight, we analyzed the chromatin conformation of the gene by DNase-I sensitivity assay (36Weintraub H. Groudine M. Science. 1976; 193: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 37Wu C. Bingham P.M. Livak K.J. Holmgren R. Elgin S.C.

A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and showed that the conformation was opened in the parthenogenones. This suggests that the expression of the U2afbp-rs gene in maternal alleles of the parthenogenones occurs because of the opened chromatin structure and that paternal alleles could be involved in the formation of a compacted chromatin structure but not in the methylation status. This discrepancy between methylation status and chromatin structure is not observed in the biparental embryos. In the mouse U2afbp-rsgene, the methylation pattern and the chromatin structure have also been correlated with the paternal specific expression of this gene (27Shibata H. Yoshino K. Sunahara S. Gondo Y. Katsuki M. Ueda T. Kamiya M. Muramatsu M. Murakami Y. Kalcheva I. Plass C. Chapman V.M. Hayashizaki Y. Genomics. 1996; 35: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,28Feri R. Boyano M.D. Allen N.D. Kelsey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 14390-14397Google Scholar). A recent report on mechanisms underlying the chromatin conformation showed that DNA methylation causes histone deacetylation to modify chromatin and silence genes (39Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). Thus a further experiment is required to clarify the unregulated expression of theU2afbp-rs gene seen in parthenogenones. The explanation for the unregulated expression of the U2afbp-rs gene in the parthenogenetic fetus has not been established. One possible reason is that de novo gene modification by paternally derived factors, which is necessary for the establishment of maternal imprinting, does not occur in the parthenogenones. The trans-acting factors may affect the ability to bind with the transcription factors to regulate the domain of the gene. A more likely possibility, however, is that a dose-compensation mechanism underlies this phenomenon. The finding that expression of the U2afbp-rs gene in androgenones was similar to that in the controls may support this conjecture, suggesting that the U2afbp-rs gene transcript may itself regulate the transcription activity. Many imprinted genes, such as Igf2,Igf2r, Peg1/Mest,Peg3, and H19, maintain their parental specific expression in uniparental embryos (13Walsh C. Glaser A. Fundele R. Ferguson-Smith A. Barton S.

However, the present results show that this is not the case for theU2afbp-rs. This suggests that both parental alleles are necessary for the establishment and maintenance of the parentally specific expression pattern. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disruption of imprinted status in parthenogenetic embryos remain to be clarified. Further investigation into this kind of disruption could provide greater insight into the characteristics of imprinting genes."

The present study has used cysteine scanning mutagenesis to examine structure-function relationships within stalk segment 5 (S5) of the yeast plasma-membrane H+-ATPase. Of 29 Cys mutants that were made and examined, two (G670C and R682C) were blocked in biogenesis, presumably due to protein misfolding. In addition, one mutant (S681C) had very low ATPase activity, and another (F685C) displayed a 40-fold decrease in sensitivity to orthovanadate, reflecting a shift in equilibrium from the E2conformational state toward E1. By far the most striking group of mutants (F666C, L671C, I674C, A677C, I684C, R687C, and Y689C) were constitutively activated even in the absence of glucose, with rates of ATP hydrolysis and kinetic properties normally seen only in glucose-metabolizing cells. Previous work has suggested that activation of the wild-type H+-ATPase results from kinase-mediated phosphorylation in the auto-inhibitory C-terminal region of the 100-kDa polypeptide.

Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes have a 100-kDa catalytic subunit that is anchored in the membrane by four hydrophobic segments (M1–4) at the N-terminal end of the molecule and six hydrophobic segments (M5–10) at the C-terminal end. They split ATP by way of a covalent β-aspartyl phosphate intermediate and alternate between two major conformational states (E1 and E2) during the reaction cycle.Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase has been solved at 2.6 Å (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), furnishing a valuable framework for further work on the transport mechanism of the P2-type ATPases. The cytoplasmic part of the molecule includes the N- and C-terminal segments, the small hydrophilic loop between M2 and M3, and the large hydrophilic loop between M4 and M5 and is organized into three domains: (a) N (ATP-binding domain), (b) P (phosphorylation), and (c) A (“actuator” or anchor for domain N). Within the membrane, the 10 hydrophobic α-helices assemble together in a complex way, with 4 of the inner helices (M4, M5, M6, and M8) providing the actual Ca2+-liganding residues.As seen earlier by cryoelectron microscopy of the sarcoplasmic reticulum enzyme (3Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and the plasma membrane H+-ATPase ofNeurospora crassa (4Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a stalk-like region connects the cytoplasmic part of the molecule to the membrane. Not surprisingly, there is growing evidence that the stalk plays a conformationally active role. In a recent study of the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, our laboratory carried out scanning mutagenesis to examine structure-function relationships in stalk segment 4 (S4), which forms a short, relatively well-conserved link between the phosphorylated aspartate residue (Asp-378) and M4. Kinetic analysis of mutants along the entire length of S4 revealed 13 consecutive positions at which amino acid substitutions led to a shift in equilibrium from the E2 state of the ATPase toward the E1 state (5Ambesi A. Miranda M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase have revealed conformationally important residues in S4 of that enzyme as well (6Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Garnett C. Sumbilla C. Belda F.F. Chen L. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11019-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In the work described here, we have turned to stalk segment 5 (S5), located at the opposite end of the large cytoplasmic loop. In the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, M5 and S5 form a continuous α-helix, 60-Å long, stretching from the membrane into the cytoplasm and seeming to serve as a “center mast” around which the rest of the molecule is organized (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). To discover whether S5 of the yeast H+-ATPase contains conformationally active residues, we performed cysteine scanning mutagenesis along the entire segment, from Ala-661 to Tyr-689, followed by kinetic analysis of each of the mutants. Based on the results, only one residue influences the equilibrium between E1 and E2 conformations. By contrast, there are seven residues at which mutations alter the regulation of the ATPase by glucose, leading to a constitutively activated form of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONThe original goal of this study was to identify amino acid residues in stalk segment 5 that play an important role in the reaction cycle of the yeast Pma1 H+-ATPase. The strategy, as described previously (5Ambesi A. Miranda M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was to screen for mutations that increase the IC50 for vanadate by shifting the conformational equilibrium away from the E2 state (to which vanadate binds) toward E1; typically, such mutants also display a reduced Km for MgATP and an alkaline change in pH optimum. Unlike stalk segment 4, where mutations of this type occurred at 13 consecutive positions, only 1 vanadate-resistant mutant (F685C) was seen in S5. At the corresponding position of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (Tyr-754), Sorensen and Andersen (34Sorensen T.L.-M. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have also observed kinetic changes upon substitution with Ala, but in this case, there was an increase in apparent affinity for vanadate, reflecting an elevated dephosphorylation rate of E2P to E2.A closer correspondence between the two ATPases was evident at Arg-682 (Arg-751 in the SERCA Ca2+-ATPase), a residue found in all known P-type ATPases. Here, substitution by Cys in the H+-ATPase or by Ala, Ile, or Glu in the Ca2+-ATPase virtually abolished expression, suggesting that the conserved Arg plays an essential role in protein folding. Indeed, in the recently published crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), Arg-751 interacts with several residues in the cytoplasmically exposed M6-M7 loop; it is easy to imagine that these interactions may serve to stabilize the protein.By far the most significant finding of the present study was that seven periodically spaced residues in S5 play a role in the regulation of yeast H+-ATPase by glucose. Rapid, reversible down-regulation of ATPase activity during glucose starvation was first observed by Serrano (33Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), who found it to be associated with a reduction in the apparent affinity for MgATP and a shift in pH optimum from pH 6.0 to pH 5.7. Since then, evidence has mounted that down-regulation is mediated by the C terminus of the ATPase, functioning as an auto-inhibitory domain. Consistent with this idea, the yeast ATPase can be activated by deleting 11 or 18 amino acid residues from the C terminus (35Portillo F. de Larrinoa I.F. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Mason A.B. Kardos T.B. Monk B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1372: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not yet fully understood in molecular terms, glucose has been shown to trigger kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the ATPase on one or more Ser/Thr residues (37Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis has identified two potential phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region (Ser-899 and Thr-912) at which amino acid substitutions modify glucose regulation (38Portillo F. Eraso P. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A recent study by Goossens et al. (39Goossens A. De la Fuente N. Forment J. Serrano R. Portillo F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7654-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) provides evidence that a novel protein kinase known as Ptk2 acts on the first of the two sites, whereas the second is a potential phosphorylation site for calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Based on all of these findings, it is attractive to think that glucose induces the phosphorylation of Ser-899 and Thr-912, somehow displacing the C terminus and releasing the ATPase from auto-inhibition. A more detailed discussion of this hypothesis can be found in a recent review by Portillo (40Portillo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).If the C terminus can indeed inhibit the activity of the yeast H+-ATPase, one would like to know how it does so. A previous study by Eraso and Portillo (41Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) took a useful step toward answering this question by isolating intragenic suppressors of the double mutant S911A/T912A, which exhibits little or no glucose activation and cannot grow on glucose medium. Fourteen second-site suppressor mutations were isolated by their ability to restore growth on glucose. Of them, four mapped in the C-terminal region, three mapped in S2, two mapped in S4, four mapped in the presumed ATP-binding domain of the large cytoplasmic loop, and two mapped toward the end of the cytoplasmic loop in the region that we have defined as S5. Direct assays of isolated plasma membranes showed that all of the suppressor mutations produced significant increases in ATPase activity in glucose-starved cells. However, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes varied, with some exhibiting changes inKm and pH optimum characteristic of the activated state, and others not doing so. Most relevant to the present study are the two suppressor mutations mapping in S5. One, G670S, led to a 7-fold increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis in starved cells, along with a significant drop in Km (from 4.0 to 1.2 mm), a rise in pH optimum (from pH 5.5 to pH 6.3), and a fall in the IC50 for vanadate (from 10.0 to 0.5 μm); it therefore met the criteria for constitutive activation as described above. The other suppressor mutant isolated by Eraso and Portillo (41Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), P669L, displayed a 10-fold elevation in the rate of hydrolysis in starved cells, accompanied by a smaller rise in pH optimum (to pH 6.0) and a fall in the IC50 (to 0.9 μm) but not by a detectable change inKm; thus, it seems to be an intermediate case. Of the related mutations that were constructed in the present study, G670C blocked biogenesis and could not be characterized, whereas P669C had reasonable specific activity, a slightly lowered Kmand IC50, and a slightly elevated pH optimum (see TableII).At the structural level, it is presumably significant that the seven constitutively activated mutants described in the present study map to one face of an α-helix, along with the P669L and G670S mutations of Eraso and Portillo (Ref. 41Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig.3). Also on the same face are F685C (a mutation affecting the equilibrium between E1 and E2 conformations; see above) and R682C (one of two mutations leading to arrest in the endoplasmic reticulum). Although it is tempting to think that this face of the S5 α-helix may interact directly with the C terminus to bring about auto-inhibition, the interaction may equally well be indirect; high-resolution structures of the ATPase in the glucose-starved and glucose-metabolizing states will be required to settle this question.In the meantime, it is interesting to consider glucose regulation of the yeast H+-ATPase in a more general framework. Although N- and C-terminal sequences have been poorly conserved among P2-type ATPases, both termini have taken on regulatory roles in various members of the group. For example, the C terminus of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which is considerably longer than that of the yeast enzyme, has been well documented to function as an auto-inhibitory domain, and inhibition is reversed by the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the C terminus (reviewed by Morsomme and Boutry (42Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar)). Once again, mutations elsewhere in the ATPase can also reverse the inhibition (43Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 44Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase of animal cells is also regulated by means of the C terminus, where calmodulin binding stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis and improves the affinities for Ca2+ and ATP (reviewed by Carafoli and Brini (45Carafoli E. Brini M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, a recently described plant endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase is thought to be activated by the binding of calmodulin to its very long N terminus (46Curran A. Hwang I. Corbin J. Martinez S. Rayle D. Sze H. Harper J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30301-30308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, as one might have predicted, the P2-type ATPases have evolved a variety of regulatory mechanisms, each involving its own auxiliary molecules and binding sites. Given the high degree of interest in this area, the next few years are likely to see continued progress toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulation. The plasma membrane H+-ATPase of yeast belongs to the P2 subfamily of cation-transporting ATPases and is structurally and functionally related to the Na+,K+-, H+,K+-, and Ca2+-ATPases of animal cells (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes have a 100-kDa catalytic subunit that is anchored in the membrane by four hydrophobic segments (M1–4) at the N-terminal end of the molecule and six hydrophobic segments (M5–10) at the C-terminal end. They split ATP by way of a covalent β-aspartyl phosphate intermediate and alternate between two major conformational states (E1 and E2) during the reaction cycle. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase has been solved at 2.6 Å (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

In the work described here, we have turned to stalk segment 5 (S5), located at the opposite end of the large cytoplasmic loop. In the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, M5 and S5 form a continuous α-helix, 60-Å long, stretching from the membrane into the cytoplasm and seeming to serve as a “center mast” around which the rest of the molecule is organized (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). To discover whether S5 of the yeast H+-ATPase contains conformationally active residues, we performed cysteine scanning mutagenesis along the entire segment, from Ala-661 to Tyr-689, followed by kinetic analysis of each of the mutants. Based on the results, only one residue influences the equilibrium between E1 and E2 conformations. By contrast, there are seven residues at which mutations alter the regulation of the ATPase by glucose, leading to a constitutively activated form of the enzyme. DISCUSSIONThe original goal of this study was to identify amino acid residues in stalk segment 5 that play an important role in the reaction cycle of the yeast Pma1 H+-ATPase. The strategy, as described previously (5Ambesi A. Miranda M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was to screen for mutations that increase the IC50 for vanadate by shifting the conformational equilibrium away from the E2 state (to which vanadate binds) toward E1; typically, such mutants also display a reduced Km for MgATP and an alkaline change in pH optimum. Unlike stalk segment 4, where mutations of this type occurred at 13 consecutive positions, only 1 vanadate-resistant mutant (F685C) was seen in S5. At the corresponding position of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (Tyr-754), Sorensen and Andersen (34Sorensen T.L.-M. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have also observed kinetic changes upon substitution with Ala, but in this case, there was an increase in apparent affinity for vanadate, reflecting an elevated dephosphorylation rate of E2P to E2.A closer correspondence between the two ATPases was evident at Arg-682 (Arg-751 in the SERCA Ca2+-ATPase), a residue found in all known P-type ATPases. Here, substitution by Cys in the H+-ATPase or by Ala, Ile, or Glu in the Ca2+-ATPase virtually abolished expression, suggesting that the conserved Arg plays an essential role in protein folding. Indeed, in the recently published crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), Arg-751 interacts with several residues in the cytoplasmically exposed M6-M7 loop; it is easy to imagine that these interactions may serve to stabilize the protein.By far the most significant finding of the present study was that seven periodically spaced residues in S5 play a role in the regulation of yeast H+-ATPase by glucose. Rapid, reversible down-regulation of ATPase activity during glucose starvation was first observed by Serrano (33Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), who found it to be associated with a reduction in the apparent affinity for MgATP and a shift in pH optimum from pH 6.0 to pH 5.7. Since then, evidence has mounted that down-regulation is mediated by the C terminus of the ATPase, functioning as an auto-inhibitory domain. Consistent with this idea, the yeast ATPase can be activated by deleting 11 or 18 amino acid residues from the C terminus (35Portillo F. de Larrinoa I.F. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Mason A.B. Kardos T.B. Monk B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1372: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not yet fully understood in molecular terms, glucose has been shown to trigger kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the ATPase on one or more Ser/Thr residues (37Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis has identified two potential phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region (Ser-899 and Thr-912) at which amino acid substitutions modify glucose regulation (38Portillo F. Eraso P. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A recent study by Goossens et al. (39Goossens A. De la Fuente N. Forment J. Serrano R. Portillo F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7654-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) provides evidence that a novel protein kinase known as Ptk2 acts on the first of the two sites, whereas the second is a potential phosphorylation site for calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Based on all of these findings, it is attractive to think that glucose induces the phosphorylation of Ser-899 and Thr-912, somehow displacing the C terminus and releasing the ATPase from auto-inhibition. A more detailed discussion of this hypothesis can be found in a recent review by Portillo (40Portillo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).If the C terminus can indeed inhibit the activity of the yeast H+-ATPase, one would like to know how it does so. A previous study by Eraso and Portillo (41Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) took a useful step toward answering this question by isolating intragenic suppressors of the double mutant S911A/T912A, which exhibits little or no glucose activation and cannot grow on glucose medium. Fourteen second-site suppressor mutations were isolated by their ability to restore growth on glucose. Of them, four mapped in the C-terminal region, three mapped in S2, two mapped in S4, four mapped in the presumed ATP-binding domain of the large cytoplasmic loop, and two mapped toward the end of the cytoplasmic loop in the region that we have defined as S5. Direct assays of isolated plasma membranes showed that all of the suppressor mutations produced significant increases in ATPase activity in glucose-starved cells. However, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes varied, with some exhibiting changes inKm and pH optimum characteristic of the activated state, and others not doing so. Most relevant to the present study are the two suppressor mutations mapping in S5. One, G670S, led to a 7-fold increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis in starved cells, along with a significant drop in Km (from 4.0 to 1.2 mm), a rise in pH optimum (from pH 5.5 to pH 6.3), and a fall in the IC50 for vanadate (from 10.0 to 0.5 μm); it therefore met the criteria for constitutive activation as described above. The other suppressor mutant isolated by Eraso and Portillo (41Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), P669L, displayed a 10-fold elevation in the rate of hydrolysis in starved cells, accompanied by a smaller rise in pH optimum (to pH 6.0) and a fall in the IC50 (to 0.9 μm) but not by a detectable change inKm; thus, it seems to be an intermediate case. Of the related mutations that were constructed in the present study, G670C blocked biogenesis and could not be characterized, whereas P669C had reasonable specific activity, a slightly lowered Kmand IC50, and a slightly elevated pH optimum (see TableII).At the structural level, it is presumably significant that the seven constitutively activated mutants described in the present study map to one face of an α-helix, along with the P669L and G670S mutations of Eraso and Portillo (Ref. 41Eraso P. Portillo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10393-10399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig.3). Also on the same face are F685C (a mutation affecting the equilibrium between E1 and E2 conformations; see above) and R682C (one of two mutations leading to arrest in the endoplasmic reticulum). Although it is tempting to think that this face of the S5 α-helix may interact directly with the C terminus to bring about auto-inhibition, the interaction may equally well be indirect; high-resolution structures of the ATPase in the glucose-starved and glucose-metabolizing states will be required to settle this question.In the meantime, it is interesting to consider glucose regulation of the yeast H+-ATPase in a more general framework. Although N- and C-terminal sequences have been poorly conserved among P2-type ATPases, both termini have taken on regulatory roles in various members of the group. For example, the C terminus of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which is considerably longer than that of the yeast enzyme, has been well documented to function as an auto-inhibitory domain, and inhibition is reversed by the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the C terminus (reviewed by Morsomme and Boutry (42Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar)). Once again, mutations elsewhere in the ATPase can also reverse the inhibition (43Morsomme P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. De Meester S. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 44Morsomme P. Dambly S. Maudoux O. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34837-34842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase of animal cells is also regulated by means of the C terminus, where calmodulin binding stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis and improves the affinities for Ca2+ and ATP (reviewed by Carafoli and Brini (45Carafoli E. Brini M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, a recently described plant endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase is thought to be activated by the binding of calmodulin to its very long N terminus (46Curran A. Hwang I. Corbin J. Martinez S. Rayle D. Sze H. Harper J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30301-30308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, as one might have predicted, the P2-type ATPases have evolved a variety of regulatory mechanisms, each involving its own auxiliary molecules and binding sites. Given the high degree of interest in this area, the next few years are likely to see continued progress toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulation.

Strikingly, molecular modeling indicated that the active site geometry is not a critical parameter for the classification of major and minor Bacillus SPases. Even though the substrate binding site of the minor SPase SipV is smaller than that of other known SPases, SipV could be converted into a major SPase without changing this site. Instead, replacement of amino-terminal residues of SipV with corresponding residues of the major SPase SipS was sufficient for conversion of SipV into a major SPase.

The type I SPases are integral membrane proteins that remove signal peptides from preproteins during or shortly after translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, thereby releasing the mature proteins from the trans side of the membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and2Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In recent years, type I SPases from many different organisms have been identified. Comparison of these SPases showed that they can be divided in two sub-families: P (prokaryotic)-type and ER (endoplasmic reticulum)-type SPases (3Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The P-type SPases are found in eubacteria and organelles of eukaryotes. In contrast, the ER-type SPases are typical for the endoplasmic reticular membrane. Strikingly, a few ER-type SPases were shown to be present in sporulating Gram-positive eubacteria such as Bacillus subtilis (3Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In fact, B. subtilis was the first eubacterium in which the presence of both P- and ER-type SPases was demonstrated. With respect to SPases,B. subtilis is not only exceptional because it contains both P- and ER-type SPases but also because it is the organism with the largest known number of type I SPases. These include the chromosomally encoded P-type SPases SipS, SipT, SipU, and SipV, the plasmid-encoded P-type SPases SipP1015 and SipP1040, and the chromosomally encoded ER-type SPase SipW (3Tjalsma H.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2448-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that at least some of the SPases of B. subtilis have specialized functions. Indeed, it was shown recently that SipS, SipT, and SipP1015 are of major importance for the secretion of degradative enzymes and cell viability, whereas SipU, SipV, and SipW have only a minor role in protein secretion and are probably involved in specific nonessential processes (3Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2448-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, SipW is specifically required for the processing of two precursors, pre-TasA and pre-YqxM, but not for cell viability (9Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7065-7069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stöver A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the presence of a single major SPase (i.e. SipS, SipT, or SipP1015) is sufficient for the growth and cell viability of B. subtilis, it seems the secretory precursor processing machinery of this organism is functionally redundant (3Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2448-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to an amino-terminal membrane anchor domain (A), all P-type SPases contain four well conserved domains (B–E) (2Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These conserved domains include residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis. Specifically, domain B contains a strictly conserved Ser residue, and domain D contains a strictly conserved Lys residue. Together, these residues form a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad (11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.-C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The domains B–E of the P-type SPases are conserved in the ER-type SPases. Nevertheless, instead of a Lys residue, domain D of the ER-type SPases contains a strictly conserved His residue, which is required for catalysis. At present, it is not known whether this His residue is part of a Ser-His catalytic dyad or a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad as described for the classic serine proteases (12Van Valkenburgh C. Chen X.M. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Tjalsma H. Stöver A.G. Driks A. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25102-25108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The distinction between P-type and ER-type SPases can readily be made on the basis of the conserved Lys or His residues in domain D. In contrast, it is not presently clear which properties determine whether a type I SPase is a major or a minor SPase of B. subtilis. A clear definition of these properties is important to understand the molecular basis for SPase substrate specificity. Therefore, the present studies were aimed at the characterization of differences between major and minor Bacillus SPases and the identification of domains in these enzymes that are critical for their specificity. The results show that major and minor Bacillus SPases can be distinguished by phylogenetic analyses and that critical information for their role in cell viability is provided by residues that are located amino-terminally of the catalytic Ser residue. Strikingly, molecular modeling of the active site of major and minor P-type SPases of B. subtilis suggests that the active site cleft of the minor SPase SipV is significantly smaller than those of the other knownBacillus P-type SPases. Nevertheless, this difference can not explain why SipV is a minor SPase. TableI lists the plasmids and bacterial strains used. Tryptone/yeast-extract medium contained Bacto tryptone (1%), Bacto yeast extract (0.5%), and NaCl (1%). If required, the media for Escherichia coli were supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) or kanamycin (20 μg/ml); the media for B. subtilis were supplemented with kanamycin (20 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (Cm) (5 μg/ml).Table IPlasmids and bacterial strainsRelevant propertiesReference no.PlasmidspGEFdSH-K83Aencodes sf-SipS-His K83A of B. subtilis; 3.6 kb; Apr19van Roosmalen M.L.

Alignments were performed with ClustalX software (14Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35403) Google Scholar) using the “Gonnet 250” and “Gonnet series” matrices as the pairwise alignment parameters and multiple alignment parameters, respectively. Default gap opening and extension parameters were applied. When the SPase of E. coli (Lep) was included in the alignments using the same parameters, the aligned sequences showed highly congruent areas that correspond to α-helices, β-strands, and previously defined conserved domains (D) of Lep and other type I SPases (2Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.-C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Therefore, the complete data set, predicted α-helices, β-strands, and conserved domains were used in the phylogenetic analyses. Autapomorphic insertions or deletions were removed from all data sets. Tree reconstructions were performed according to two different methods. First, the maximum likelihood method was used as implemented in the PUZZLE 4.02 software (15Strimmer K. Von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). The variable time matrix was applied with four γ rates. One thousand replications were used to calculate the quartet puzzling values. Second, the maximum parsimony (MP) method was used as implemented in the program PAUP 4.03b. The MP tree reconstruction was done with the branch-swapping/tree-bisection-reconnection algorithm by applying 10 random additions of sequences. One thousand replications were used to calculate the bootstrap values. Procedures for DNA purification, restriction, ligation, agarose gel electrophoresis, and the transformation of E. coli were carried out as described (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) as described (17van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequences were analyzed with the PCGene Analysis program (version 6.7, Intelligenetics, Inc.) and ClustalW (version 1.74) (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55621) Google Scholar). B. subtilis was transformed as described (3Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Correct integration of plasmids or resistance markers into the chromosome of B. subtilis was verified by Southern blotting or PCR. The plasmid pGDL90, specifying Sip (Bli) from Bacillus licheniformis, was constructed by ligating an EcoRI- and SalI-cleaved PCR-amplified fragment of sip(Bli) into the corresponding sites of pGDL48. The sip(Bli)-specific fragment was amplified with primers Lbl1 (5′-ACGCGTCGACTATGCTGTGACAGACTG-3′) and Lbl2 (5′-CGGAATTCGCAGTGCTGGCATCA-3′) using B. licheniformischromosomal DNA as a template. Plasmid pM0V, specifying a hybrid of SipS and SipV from B. subtilis, was constructed by ligating an EcoRI- and SalI-cleaved PCR-amplified fragment of sipV into the corresponding sites of pM0. ThesipV-specific fragment was amplified with primers JBV1 (5′-TGTCGTCGACGGTGACAGTATGAACCCGACCTTCC-3′) and JBV2 (5′-CGGAATTCGCTAGCGACGCCTCTTCAATTAGCA-3′) using B. subtilis chromosomal DNA as a template. Note that primer JBV1 is designed such that the resulting SipSV fusion protein contains the amino-terminal fragment of SipS (residues 1–43) that includes the active site Ser-43 residue fused to the carboxyl-terminal fragment starting at the corresponding position in SipV (residues 34–168). Polyclonal antibodies against SipS ofB. subtilis were prepared by the immunization of rabbits (Eurogentec) with a purified soluble form of this protein (sf-SipS-His K83A). This protein consists of the catalytic domain of SipS lacking residues 2–29. Furthermore, sf-SipS-His K83A ofB. subtilis (Bsu) contains a carboxyl-terminal hexa-histidine tag, facilitating the purification by metal affinity chromatography (19van Roosmalen M.L. Jongbloed J.D.H. Kuipers A. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5765-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (20Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). To detect SPases, B. subtilis or E. coli cells were separated from the growth medium by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g, room temperature), and samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were prepared as described previously (19van Roosmalen M.L. Jongbloed J.D.H. Kuipers A. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5765-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Smith H. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SPases were visualized with specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit-IgG conjugates (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Three-dimensional models of BacillusSPases were built on the basis of homology with the E. coliSPase (PDB Protein Data Bank no. 1b12) using the molecular modeling program What-If (22Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). The molecular dynamics program GroMacs (University of Groningen, MD group) was used to perform a standard energy minimization in vacuo of a pentapeptide substrate in the three-dimensional model of SipS. To investigate the relationships between major and minor SPases of the Bacillus species, phylogenetic analyses were performed by applying the maximum likelihood and MP methods. For this purpose, either the complete sequences, conserved α-helices, β-strands, or domains were used (TableII). Consistent with the fact that only few α-helices are present in type I SPases (11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.-C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the maximum likelihood analysis that was based on α-helices resulted in a tree with a poorly resolved topology, and the equivalent MP analysis in 108 “most parsimonious trees” (112 steps long, CI excluding uninformative characters = 0.8077, RI = 0.7101, RC = 0.5833). Far better results were obtained when complete sequences, β-strands, or conserved domains were used in the maximum likelihood and MP analyses (Table II). In fact, the MP analysis with complete sequences resulted in one most parsimonious tree (805 steps, CI excluding uninformative characters = 0.8188, RI = 0.7152, RC = 0.5988) (Fig. 1). One most parsimonious tree was obtained when conserved β-strands were used (283 steps, CI excluding uninformative characters = 0.8618, RI = 0.8046, RC = 0.7079), and three most parsimonious trees were obtained with the conserved domains (134 steps, CI excluding uninformative characters = 0.8319, RI = 0.7938, RC = 0.6753). Notably, all data sets are congruent with respect to the clustering of the four best supported groups of BacillusSPases: (i) the SipW group, (ii) the SipV group, (iii) the SipT of Bsu + SipT of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Bam) group, and (iv) the SipS group (Table II). As shown in Fig. 1, SipT ofBacillus anthracis (Ban) seems to be more closely related to the SipW group (bootstrap percentages/quartet puzzling values are 100/not calculated for complete sequences and 100/70 for β-strands) than to the SipT (Bsu) + SipT (Bam) group. To prevent the possible misinterpretation that SipT (Ban) is related to the major SPases SipT (Bsu) and SipT (Bam), the SipT (Ban) protein was renamed SipX (Ban). Furthermore, SipC of Bacillus caldolyticus (Bca) seems to be most closely related to SipV (Bsu) and SipV (Bam). Most importantly, the functionally defined major SPases SipS, SipT, and SipP1015 of B. subtilis cluster together (Fig. 1,circled). This clustering is supported by bootstrap percentages of 79/93 and 77/60 when complete sequences or β-strands were used for the analyses, respectively. This observation suggests that the other SPases in this cluster, SipP1040, SipS (Bam), SipT (Bam), and Sip (Bli), should also be classified as major SPases. In contrast, all enzymes not included in this cluster would be minor SPases.Table IISummary of quartet puzzling and bootstrap valuesMaximum likelihoodMaximum parsimonyCSαβDCSαβDNumber of variable (ML)/informative (MP) sites236348242159235932SipW (1)91717593100759999SipV (2)8484987299569898SipT Bsu + SipT Bam (3)7880758086SipS Bsu + SipS Bam (4)908975988772SipP (5)91605361(3) + (4) + (5) + Sip Bli9379607977(3) + (4) + (5) + Sip Bli + SipU90968580(1) + SipU62(1) + SipX Ban7010099(2) + SipC Bca66965467(3) + SipX Ban81Bootstrap values were obtained with the maximum likelihood method (1000 replications each) and quartet puzzling values with the maximum parsimony method.

Because the distinction between major and minor SPases is based on functional differences, we tested the outcome of the phylogenetic analysis in complementation experiments with two representative SPases: SipC ofB. caldolyticus (23van Roosmalen M.L. Jongbloed J.D.H. de Jong A. van Eerden J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which clusters with the minor SPases (Fig. 1), and Sip (Bli) of B. licheniformis (24Hoang V. Hofemeister J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which clusters with the major SPases. To this purpose, the sipCgene was expressed in the B. subtilis strain ΔS, which lacks the sipS gene, by transformation with the pGDL48-derived plasmid pGDL46.36. Subsequently, we tried to disrupt thesipT gene of the resulting strain with a Cm resistance marker by transformation with chromosomal DNA of B. subtilisΔT-Cm. Even though this experiment was repeated several times, no Cm-resistant transformants were obtained, indicating that SipC ofB. caldolyticus behaves as a minor SPase in B. subtilis that cannot replace SipS and SipT. A completely different result was obtained in parallel experiments with Sip (Bli). To test whether this SPase could replace SipS and SipT of B. subtilis, the sip (Bli) gene was amplified by PCR and cloned. Next, B. subtilis ΔS was transformed with the pGDL48-derived plasmid pGDL90, which carries the sip (Bli) gene, and the sipT gene of the resulting strain was disrupted with a Cm resistance marker by transformation with the chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis ΔT-Cm. Viable Cm-resistant transformants were obtained and shown to have disrupted thesipS and sipT genes (data not shown). As shown by Western blotting, these transformants produce Sip (Bli), which cross-reacts with the antibodies raised against the catalytic domain of SipS of B. subtilis (Fig. 2). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that Sip (Bli) behaves as a major SPase and SipC (Bca) as a minor SPase in B. subtilis. The view that all SPases clustering with SipS (Bsu), SipT (Bsu), SipP1015, and Sip (Bli) behave as major SPases was finally confirmed by similar complementation experiments, demonstrating that SipS (Bam), SipT (Bam), and SipP1040 can replace SipS and SipT ofB. subtilis. 2J. D. H. Jongbloed and H. Tjalsma, unpublished observations. Because the antibodies raised against SipS of B. subtiliscross-reacted with Sip (Bli) (these studies) and the major SPase SipP1015 (8Tjalsma H. van den Dolder J. Meijer W.J.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2448-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether these antibodies could be used to discriminate between major and minor SPases of B. subtilis.To this purpose, Western blotting experiments were performed with strains containing plasmids for the overproduction of the respective SPases. Only SipT was shown to cross-react with the antibodies raised against SipS, which implies that the major SPases SipS, SipT, and SipP1015 share at least one antigenic determinant that is absent from the minor SPases SipU, SipV, and SipW (Fig.3). This idea is supported by the observation that the major SPases SipS (Bam), SipT (Bam), and SipP1040 cross-reacted with the antibodies against SipS (Bsu) (data not shown). It has to be noted, however, that the antibodies against SipS also cross-reacted with the catalytic domain of SipC (Bca) upon overproduction in E. coli (data not shown), indicating that these antibodies do not allow the discrimination between major and minor Bacillus SPases in general. To investigate whether the active site geometries of the known major and minor P-type SPases of B. subtilis are significantly different, three-dimensional models of these SPases were constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of the E. coli SPase as determined by Paetzel et al. (11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.-C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the sequences of these SPases were aligned with the ClustalW program (Fig.4). SipS (Bsu) and the E. coliSPase show an overall sequence identity of 26%, which is low for modeling by homology. However, the four conserved domains B–E of these SPases show 62% sequence identity. Notably, the active site of theE. coli SPase is almost entirely composed of these four conserved domains that are typical for all P-type SPases (11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.-C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We have therefore based our conclusions exclusively on modeled active site regions of Bacillus SPases. The homology modeling program What-If was used to generate the three-dimensional models of various known SPases of bacilli. As shown for SipS of B. subtilis(Fig. 5), Met-44 and Leu-48 (marked inblue), Val-39 and Val-82 (marked in green), and Lys-83 form the S1 substrate binding pocket, whereas Tyr-37, Val-54, Val-73, and His-80 (marked in yellow) together with the residues marked in green form the S3 pocket. These findings are in good agreement with the structure of the S1 and S3 substrate binding pockets of the SPase of E. coli (25Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 27-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the idea that the latter residues make contact with the substrate (i.e. the SPase recognition sequence in a precursor protein) was supported by a molecular dynamics analysis in which a pentapeptide of five Ala residues in a β-strand conformation was modeled into the substrate binding pockets of SipS (Fig. 5). This pentapeptide was placed at the position that corresponds to that of the penem inhibitor in the crystal structure of the E. coli SPase I (11Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.-C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).Figure 5Active site models for SipS and SipV.Stereo pictures of residues in the modeled active site regions of SipS (top) and SipV (bottom). Residues rendered in spheres are likely to be involved in the formation of the S1 pocket (Met-44 and Leu-48 of SipS, blue), S1 and S3 pockets (Val-39 and Val-82 of SipS, green), or S3 pocket (Tyr-37, Val-54, Val-73, and His-80 of SipS, yellow) for substrate binding. The SipS model contains a pentapeptide of Ala residues, which are docked in the substrate binding pocket. The P1 and P3 residues of this model substrate are shown in orange. The active site Ser-43 and Lys-83 residues as well as Tyr-81 of SipS and the corresponding Leu residue of SipV are shown as “ball and stick” models. The latter residues are probably involved in substrate stabilization by interaction with P2 residues of the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The comparison of our models for the P-type SPases of B. subtilis showed that the substrate binding pockets of SipS, SipT, SipP1015, and SipP1040 were highly similar, whereas that of SipV was significantly smaller (Fig. 5). Conversely, the substrate binding site of SipU seemed to have a wider S1 pocket than the equivalent sites of the other P-type SPases of B. subtilis. Upon close examination, the volume of the substrate binding pocket of SipV is relatively small because the side chains of Leu-73, Ile-82, and possibly Leu-54 (SipS numbering) protrude into the S3 pocket (Fig. 5). The latter side chains are larger than those of the equivalent residues in SipS of B. subtilis (Val-73, Val-82, and Val-54, respectively) and other SPases (Fig. 4). Taken together, these observations indicate that the active site geometries of the minor SPases SipU and SipV of B. subtilis are different from the active site geometries of the known major SPases. To investigate whether the active site geometry is a critical determinant for major and minor Bacillus SPases, a SipS-SipV hybrid protein (denoted SipSV) was constructed, which is specified by plasmid pM0V. Notably, this fusion between SipS and SipV of B. subtiliswas made at the catalytic Ser residue of these SPases. Consequently, SipSV consists of the first 43 residues of SipS and the carboxyl-terminal part of SipV. The major advantage of this approach is that the active site geometry of SipSV is nearly identical to that of SipV (data not shown). Next, we tested whether SipSV is a major or minor SPase by introducing pM0V into B. subtilis ΔST as described above for the sipC (Bca) and sip (Bli) genes. Strikingly, viable ΔST transformants containing pM0V were obtained, showing that SipSV can replace SipS and SipT. As shown in Fig. 2, SipSV is not recognized by the antibodies raised against SipS. In conclusion, these observations show that SipSV is a major SPase and that SipV is not a minor SPase because of the geometry of its catalytic site but rather that some residues of its amino-terminal stretch determine SipV to belong to the class of minor SPases. Furthermore, the antibodies against SipS do not distinguish between major and minor SPases. On the basis of their importance for cell viability, we previously have classified the type I SPases of B. subtilis as major (SipS, SipT, and SipP) and minor SPases (SipU, SipV, and SipW) (3Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Tjalsma H. van den Dolder J. Meijer W.J.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2448-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, it was not clear which properties of these SPases are important for this functional distinction, particularly with respect to the P-type SPases. Consequently, simple amino acid sequence alignments could not be used to predict the group to which certainBacillus P-type SPases would belong. In the present studies, we show for the first time that major and minor SPases can be distinguished via phylogenetic analyses. Surprisingly, the subsequent molecular analyses demonstrate that the distinction between major and minor SPases does not relate specifically to the catalytic domain of aBacillus P-type SPase but rather to its amino-terminal domain, which contains the membrane anchor. The latter result was unexpected, because it was shown recently by Carlos et al.(26Carlos J.L. Paetzel M. Brubaker G. Karla A. Ashwell C.M. Lively M.O. Cao G.Q. Bullinger P. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38813-38822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that the transmembrane domains of P-type SPases are not important determinants for cleavage fidelity in vitro. The most important outcome of the phylogenetic analyses of theBacillus type I SPases is that the major SPases form a distinct cluster, which is well supported by the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Moreover, these phylogenetic analyses have predictive value, as exemplified by the complementation experiments with SipC (Bca) and Sip (Bli), showing that these behave as minor and major SPases, respectively, when the corresponding genes are expressed in B. subtilis. This, however, does not exclude the possibility that SipC is a major SPase in B. caldolyticus. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analyses indicate the existence of two clusters of minor SPases: the SipC/SipV, and SipW clusters. The latter cluster was identified previously because it contains the known ER-type SPases of bacilli (3Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Tjalsma H. Stöver A.G. Driks A. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25102-25108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Only two Bacillus SPases, SipU (Bsu) and SipX (Ban), do not belong to the three clusters of major SPases, SipC/SipV, or SipW. This suggests that these two SPases represent possible evolutionary intermediates between different clusters, which is particularly interesting in the case of SipX ofB. anthracis, because this P-type SPase might represent a link between the P- and ER-type Bacillus SPases. The present observation that a SipSV hybrid protein containing the largest part of the catalytic domain of the minor SPase SipV behaves as a major SPase indicates that the catalytic domain of the P-type SPases is not the most important determinant for the difference between major and minor SPases. This view is supported by the fact that, according to our models, the active site geometry of SipSV is identical to that of the minor SPase SipV. In this respect it is important to bear in mind that the S3 substrate binding pockets of SipV and SipSV are relatively small compared with those of other P-type SPases of B. subtilis, particularly SipU. Nevertheless, the possibility that subtle changes in the active site geometry of SipSV caused by the fusion between the SipS and SipV moieties result in the conversion of a minor SPase into a major SPase can presently not be excluded. The idea that the catalytic domain is not important for the difference between major and minor SPases would explain why the antibodies raised against the catalytic domain of SipS (Bsu) can not be used to distinguish between these two functionally defined groups of SPases. What could be the role of the amino-terminal residues of SipS in determining its role as a major SPase? Carlos et al. (26Carlos J.L. Paetzel M. Brubaker G. Karla A. Ashwell C.M. Lively M.O. Cao G.Q. Bullinger P. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38813-38822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have recently provided compelling evidence that the transmembrane segments of type I SPases such as SipS are not important for substrate cleavage site selection. Furthermore, we have shown recently that the membrane anchor of SipS is not required for its activity (23van Roosmalen M.L. Jongbloed J.D.H. de Jong A. van Eerden J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Together with our present results, these observations imply that the major-minor difference of SPases is not based on the recognition of residues at the −1,−3 positions, relative to the scissile peptide bond per se. This leaves at least three alternative possibilities open. First, the amino-terminal residues might position the catalytic site of a major SPase in such a way in the membrane that it can interact with the cleavage site of one or more as yet unidentified preproteins that have to be processed for cell viability. Second, the amino-terminal residues might be required for an as yet unidentified essential interaction of a major SPase with preprotein translocases. Third, the amino-terminal residues might target the respective SPases to topologically distinct regions of the membrane such as the septa of dividing cells. Notably, the regions preceding the active site Ser residues of Bacillus SPases, which include their membrane anchor, show a relatively high degree of sequence variation (23van Roosmalen M.L. Jongbloed J.D.H. de Jong A. van Eerden J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the amino-terminal region in SPase function, we are presently investigating the role of the first 42 residues of SipS by site-directed mutagenesis. We thank Dr. Gert Vriend and Dr. Rob Veltman for critical discussions on the modeling of BacillusSPases, Drs.

Previously, we identified a 201-nucleotide instability element (FIE3) in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the ftz mRNA. Here we report on the identification of two additional elements in the protein-coding region of the message: the 63-nucleotide-long FIE5-1 and the 69-nucleotide-long FIE5-2. The function of both elements was position-dependent; the same elements destabilized RNAs when present within the coding region but did not when embedded in the 3′ UTR of the hybrid mRNAs. We conclude that ftzmRNA has three redundant instability elements, two in the protein-coding region and one in the 3′ UTR. Although each instability element is sufficient to destabilize a heterologous mRNA, the destabilizing activity of the two 5′-elements depended on their position within the message.

Although each instability element is sufficient to destabilize a heterologous mRNA, the destabilizing activity of the two 5′-elements depended on their position within the message. untranslated region polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) aldolase Drosophila embryonic development depends on the precise temporal and spatial expression of maternal and zygotic pattern-forming genes (1Ingham P.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Maternal pattern-forming genes are transcribed during oogenesis, and their mRNA abundance decreases rapidly in the early embryo. Moreover, many mRNAs encoded by zygotic pattern-forming genes undergo dramatic changes in abundance and spatial distribution during early embryogenesis. To achieve these rapid changes, especially for rapid down-regulation, transcriptional control alone is insufficient, and regulation at the level of mRNA stability is essential. For instance, the maternal bicoid mRNA is completely stable during the first 2 h of embryogenesis but is rapidly destabilized at cellularization of the blastoderm (2Surdej P. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2892-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed in the following text, the zygotic fushi tarazu(ftz) mRNA is one of the most unstable eukaryotic mRNAs known. Given that most mRNAs in the Drosophilaembryo are constitutively stable (30Fontes A.M. Ito J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 44: 171-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the question arises how selected mRNAs in the same embryo cytoplasm are targeted for degradation. Recognition of the targeted RNAs by the RNA degrading machinery must involve cis-acting sequences. These sequences are the focus of the present study. ftz is a member of the pair-rule class of segmentation genes and one of the best characterized early zygotic genes. In early embryosftz mRNA is detected only from about 1.5 to 4.5 h after fertilization. When first expressed, ftz mRNA is uniformly distributed through the embryo (4Weiner M.P. Kornberg T. Nature. 1985; 318: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As development progresses, its distribution first becomes restricted to a region comprising from 15 to 65% of egg length, then to four broad bands, and finally to seven narrow stripes that encircle the embryo (4Weiner M.P. Kornberg T. Nature. 1985; 318: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Hafen E. Kuroiwa A. Gehring W.J. Cell. 1984; 37: 833-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Yu Y. Pick L. Mech. Dev. 1995; 50: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The seven stripes are short-lived, and no ftz mRNA is detected by 5 h after fertilization. This rapid change of expression pattern and formation of stripes in a short time span can be attributed to the termination of transcription in interstripe regions coupled with rapid mRNA turnover. The need for rapid mRNA turnover is emphasized by the fact that the FTZ protein activates its own transcription in a positive feedback loop (7Hiromi Y. Gehring W.J. Cell. 1987; 50: 963-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important during the evolution of the spatial pattern of ftzexpression that both mRNA and protein be rapidly cleared from the interstripe regions. Edgar et al. (8/deleted in proof.Google Scholar) measured ftz mRNA stability in embryos and found that its half-life changes from 14 min at 2.5 h to 6 min at 4 h after fertilization. This makesftz mRNA one of the shortest-lived mRNAs among higher eukaryotes (3Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Stabilization of ftz mRNA and FTZ protein results in developmental delay and defects, suggesting thatftz mRNA and FTZ protein instability are crucial for normal development (9Edgar B.A. Odell G.M. Schubiger G. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1226-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Kellerman K.A. Mattson D.M. Duncan I.

Earlier studies from this laboratory using hybrid genes that fuseftz sequences to the stable ribosomal protein A1(rpA1) mRNA provided evidence for at least two destabilizing elements in ftz mRNA (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One consisted of a 201-nucleotide element, including an essential 68-nucleotide sequence, located in the 3′ UTR1 and termed FIE3 (f tz instabilityelement 3′). The other element(s) were assigned to the 5′-one-third of the ftz mRNA but remained otherwise uncharacterized. Here we report on the identification of two separate 5′-instability elements within the first 600 nucleotides of theftz mRNA. Both 5′-elements are located within the protein-coding region of the message. Each 5′-instability element is sufficient to destabilize the stable rpA1 mRNA, but the destabilizing activity is dependent on their position within the mRNA. The first letter of the name of each construct designates the promoter that drives it. Thus, F = ftz, r =rpA1, and S = sgs-3 promoter attached to the hsp26 nurse cell enhancer. Numbering in the following text uses +1 as the position of transcription initiation, which corresponds to position 901 in the sequence deposited in GenBankTM (accession numbers X00854and K01951). We found that ftz genomic clone λA439 (13Weiner A.J. Scott M.P. Kaufman T.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 843-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) had a nine-nucleotide deletion in the protein-coding region (from 260 to 268) when compared with the sequence deposited in the data base. To resolve this discrepancy, the ftz 5′-region was amplified by PCR using DNA from yellow-white flies, the recipient strain for P-element transformation. Sequencing revealed that the same nine nucleotides were missing. Moreover, with the exception of the nine-base deletion and four one-base polymorphisms (C instead of T at 126 and 222, C instead of A at 516, and G instead of C at 551), the sequence of the entire 5′-one-third of the ftz mRNA (from 1 to 636) matched the sequence deposited in GenBankTM. These hybrid genes were reported previously (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 7.9-kb KpnI-SalI fragment (Ff5) and the 4.0-kbSalI-KpnI fragment (f3) were obtained from theftz genomic clone λA439 (13Weiner A.J. Scott M.P. Kaufman T.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 843-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 1.1-kbBamHI-SalI fragment (Rr5) and the 1.3-kbSalI-BamHI fragment (r3) were obtained from the plasmid pD5 (14Qian S. Zhang J.-Y. Kay M.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 987-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that contained the 2.4-kb BamHI fragment of the rpA1 gene. Each fragment of ftz and therpA1 gene was combined reciprocally and subcloned into pGEM3 (Promega). The 0.7-kb fragment (from 856 to 1557, where +1 is the transcription initiation site) of rat aldolase B(aldB) cDNA (15Tsutsumi K. Mukai T. Tsutsumi R. Mori M. Daimon M. Tanaka T. Yatsuki H. Hori K. Ishikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized by PCR with primers ald1 and ald2 (Table I). This PCR fragment contained the 3′-one-third of the protein-coding region and entire 3′ UTR of the aldB cDNA, including the polyadenylation signal (16Tsutsumi K. Mukai T. Tsutsumi R. Hidaka S. Arai Y. Hori K. Ishikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), provided by the primer ald2. The PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), digested with EcoRI, and inserted into the EcoRI site of the 3′ UTR of f3. In turn, this f3+aldB fragment was fused to Ff5 to produce Fftz+aldB. A f3-FIE3 fragment that lacks the 201-base pair FIE3 sequence was obtained as previously described (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fftz+aldB-FIE3 was constructed as described for Fftz+aldB, except that f3-FIE3 was used instead of f3.Table IOligonucleotides used for making constructsOligonucleotideSequence1-aBoldface type indicates endonuclease restriction sites.

Open table in a new tab The PCR products synthesized from Ff5r3 with primers 1 and 2, 1 and 4, and 3 and 2 (Table I) were digested with NgoMI and inserted into the NgoMI site in the 3′ UTR of the rpA1 gene in plasmid pD5. They were named Rr-abc, Rr-ab, and Rr-bc, respectively. PCR products were synthesized with the following primers (Table I): Ss-abc, primers 5 and 6; Ss-ab, primers 5 and 8; Ss-bc, primers 7 and 6; Ss-a, primers 5 and 10; Ss-b, primers 7 and 8; Ss-c, primers 9 and 6; Ss-b1, primers 7 and 12; Ss-b2, primers 11 and 8; Ss-b3, primers 15 and 16; Ss-c1, primers 9 and 14; Ss-c2, primers 13 and 6; Ss-c3, primers 9 and 18; Ss-c4, primers 13 and 14; Ss-c5, primers 17 and 6. For PCR fragments that lacked a translation initiation site, s-bc, b, c, b1–3, and c1–5, a seven-base sequence (GATATGG) was provided by the primer to obtain the same efficient translation initiation site as intact ftz mRNA (17Cavener D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 18Cavener D.R. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The PCR products were fused to r3. All constructs were sequenced to confirm that the PCR fragments had no errors and that the reading frame was maintained. Constructs Rr-abc, ab, bc, Fftz+aldB, and Fftz+aldB-FIE3 were introduced into CaSpeR vector (19Pirrotta V. Rodriguez R. Denhart D. Vectors: A Survey of Molecular Cloning Vectors and Their Uses. Butterworth, Boston1988: 437-456Crossref Google Scholar). To provide Ss constructs with a promoter, they were introduced into the CaSpeR4/GERM4 vector (2Surdej P. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2892-2900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contained CaSpeR, polylinker from Gehring's pW8, a nurse cell-specific enhancer from the heat shock 26 gene hsp26, and the sgs3 promoter. All constructs (500 μg/ml) were mixed with the phs-π helper (20Steller H. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1640-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (100 μg/ml) and injected into yellow-whitemutant embryos (19Pirrotta V. Rodriguez R. Denhart D. Vectors: A Survey of Molecular Cloning Vectors and Their Uses. Butterworth, Boston1988: 437-456Crossref Google Scholar, 21Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). Embryos were collected on fresh yeast plates at 25 °C for 1 h and left at 25 °C to age for different lengths of time. Embryos were collected, washed with embryo washing buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C. Embryo developmental synchrony was checked by staging an aliquot of each collection at 2–3 h of development. Collections containing more than 10% older embryos (retained) or unfertilized eggs were discarded. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated from frozen embryos by homogenization in TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (22Ito J. Kuzumaki T. Otsu K. Iuchi Y. Ishikawa K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in 1–2% agarose gels containing 18% formaldehyde, and RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNAs were fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking and hybridized with α-32P-labeled probes synthesized by random primer labeling. For hybridization with a different probe, the membrane was boiled 5 min to remove the first probe, following the manufacturer's recommendations. The plasmid pD5, containing therpA1 gene, Ff5, and f3 were used to prepare probes for Northern blot hybridization. Estimates of the half-life of mRNAs were obtained from the quantification of the radioactive signal with the Molecular Imager system (Bio-Rad). For each transgenic strain, Northern blot hybridization was repeated at least three times with RNA from separate embryo collections. The stability of transgenic mRNAs in developing embryos was measured by a strategy previously developed for this purpose (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The critical feature is the use of promoters that are strongly expressed during oogenesis but silent in early embryogenesis. The two promoters used in this study are rpA1 (14Qian S. Zhang J.-Y. Kay M.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 987-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) andhsp26/sgs3 (24Garfinkel M.D. Pruitt R.E. Meyerowitz E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 765-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Serano T.L. Cheung H.K. Frank L.H. Cohen R.S. Gene. 1994; 138: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The latter promoter contains the nurse cell-specific enhancer from the hsp26 gene linked to the basal sgs3 promoter. Another key feature is that theftz mRNA is stable in ovaries and is destabilized at fertilization. 2Fontes, A. M., Riedl, A., and Jacobs-Lorena, M. (2001) Genesis, in press. As a consequence, transcripts containing ftz sequences accumulate to high abundance during oogenesis and start decaying when the egg is fertilized.2 Because the rpA1 andhsp26/sgs3 promoters are silent in early embryos, decay of transgenic mRNA abundance (as measured by Northern blot analysis) serves as a direct measure of mRNA stability. This strategy avoids the use of drugs that may cause artifacts (27Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). TherpA1 mRNA is stable in both ovaries and embryos and served as an internal loading control. In an earlier study (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the stability of the 5′-one-third (here called f5; nucleotides 1–636) and the 3′-two-thirds (here called f3) of the ftz mRNA was investigated separately. One of these fragments (f5) was fused to the 3′-two-thirds (r3) and the other (f3) to the 5′-one-third (r5) of the stablerpA1 mRNA to yield the Ff5r3 and Rr5f3 hybrid mRNAs, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Both hybrid transcripts were unstable (Fig.2 A). Rr5f3 is transcribed maternally, and its mRNA decayed rapidly after fertilization. Ff5r3 is transcribed only transiently from the ftz promoter during early embryogenesis, and its rapid decay after 4 h of development (compare 3–4 h and 4–5 h in Fig. 2 A) indicates that this mRNA is highly unstable. We concluded that in addition to the previously characterized 201-nucleotide FIE3 in the 3′ UTR, the 5′-one-third of the ftz mRNA also contains destabilizing sequences.Figure 2Evidence for destabilizing elements in the 5′-region of the ftz mRNA. Each construct was transformed into the Drosophila germ line. Total RNAs from synchronized embryos were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization withftz and rpA1 probes. The structure of each construct is illustrated next to its name. Embryo age ranges (in h) are indicated below the autoradiograms. The rpA1 mRNA served as a loading control. A, hybridftz/rpA1 mRNAs. The r5f3 construct is driven by the rpA1 promoter, and the f5r3 construct is driven by the ftz promoter. mRNA sizes are as follows:ftz, 1.8 kb; r5f3, 1.4 kb; f5r3, 0.6 kb; rpA1, 0.6 kb.B, deletion of the FIE3 sequences from the ftzmRNA. A 700-nucleotide rat aldolase B fragment was inserted in theftz 3′ UTR to distinguish the transgenic mRNA from the endogenous ftz mRNA. The second construct differs from the first by the absence of the 201-nucleotide FIE3 element. Both constructs are driven by the ftz promoter. mRNA sizes: ftz+aldB, 2.5 kb; and ftz+aldB-FIE3, 2.3 kb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Fftz+ald-FIE3 construct provided further evidence for the presence of RNA-destabilizing sequences in f5. This construct consisted of a deletion of FIE3 from the intact ftz mRNA (Fig.1 B). This construct also contained a rat aldolase B mRNA (aldB) tag, to allow the transgenic mRNA to be distinguished on Northern blots from the endogenousftz transcript. To verify that insertion of the aldolase tag does not affect ftz mRNA stability, a control construct (Fftz+ald; Fig. 1 B) containing the intact ftzmRNA tagged with the aldB fragment was analyzed in parallel. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both constructs were unstable inDrosophila embryos, indicating that ftz mRNA contains instability elements other than FIE3. The destabilizing element of f3 is FIE3 (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The identification and characterization of the f5-destabilizing sequences (termed FIE5) was the object of this study. Previously, we have inserted FIE3 into the 3′ UTR of the stable rpA1 gene to demonstrate that this element is sufficient for mRNA destabilization (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We created similar constructs to investigate whether FIE5 is also sufficient for RNA destabilization. The entire f5 sequence (1), the 5′-two-thirds (1), and the 3′-two-thirds (211) were inserted into the 3′ UTR of rpA1 to yield constructs Rr-abc, Rr-ab, and Rr-bc, respectively (Fig. 1 C). Transcription in all constructs was driven by the rpA1 promoter. Surprisingly, the resulting three transcripts were stable in transgenic embryos (Fig. 3). These results suggest that FIE5 destabilizing activity is position-dependent and that unlike FIE3, FIE5 is not functional when located in the 3′ UTR. Next, we initiated a deletion analysis by placing the f5 fragment at its original position 5′ of the rpA1 sequences. Construct Ss-abc contained the whole f5 sequence (from 1 to 636), Ss-ab contained the 5′-two-thirds (from 1 to 423), and Ss-bc contained the 3′-two-thirds (from 217 to 636) (Fig. 1 D). All transcripts decayed rapidly during early embryogenesis (Fig. 4). These results suggest that FIE5 destabilizing sequences are likely to be present in the Ss-ab/Ss-bc overlap region. Alternatively, more than one destabilizing sequence may occur within f5. The results also indicate that the maternal hsp26/sgs3 promoter can be used for measurement of mRNA stability despite the presence of 41 additional sgs3-encoded nucleotides at the 5′-end of all transcripts driven by this promoter. Separate experiments showed that these 41 nucleotides contain no destabilizing sequences (cf. constructs Ss-a, Ss-b2, Ss-c3, and Ss-c5). A second generation of constructs placed each third of f5 next to 5′-rpA1 sequences (Ss-a, Ss-b, and Ss-c; Fig. 1 D). As shown in Fig.5, s-a mRNA was stable, whereas s-b and s-c mRNAs decayed rapidly during early embryogenesis. These results suggest that f5 has at least two destabilizing elements, one (FIE5-1) within fragment b (from 217 to 423) and the other (FIE5-2) within fragment c (from 406 to 636). Each element is sufficient for destabilization of an otherwise stable mRNA, and both elements are located in the protein-coding region of ftz mRNA. Additional deletion constructs (Ss-b1 to Ss-b3; Fig. 1 D) were generated to further map FIE5-1. Initial analysis of embryos carrying two overlapping constructs, Ss-b1 and Ss-b2, indicated that the s-b1 mRNA was unstable whereas s-b2 mRNA was stable (Fig.6). These results suggested that FIE5-1 is located in a region of Ss-b1 (250) that does not overlap with the two stable sequences, SS-a and SS-b2 (Fig. 1 D). This assumption was confirmed with a third construct, Ss-b3 (235), which encodes an unstable mRNA (Fig. 6). Thus, FIE5-1 is located within a 63-nucleotide sequence of the ftz protein-coding region (the stated length takes into account that our construct andyellow-white flies have nine fewer nucleotides than the sequence deposited in the data base; cf. “Experimental Procedures”). Additional deletion constructs (Ss-c1 to Ss-c5; Fig. 1 D) were also generated to further map FIE5-2. As shown in Fig. 7, the s-c1 and s-c2 mRNAs were both unstable in early embryos, indicating that an instability element is located in the region of overlap or that multiple instability elements are located in ftz fragment c. To clarify these issues, three more constructs (Ss-c3 to Ss-c5; Fig.1 D) were analyzed. Of the three constructs, only Ss-c4 (from 520 to 588) encoded an unstable mRNA (Fig. 7), indicating that FIE5-2 must reside within this 69-nucleotide region. In some experiments, the s-c3 mRNA was observed to decline slightly from 0–1 to 1–2 h but remained stable during the remaining time points (data not shown). In an earlier study (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we developed a new method for thein vivo analysis of mRNA stability in earlyDrosophila embryos that does not require the use of drugs or any experimental interference. This method led to the identification of a mRNA-destabilizing element (FIE3) in the ftz 3′ UTR. In this work the method was used to identify two additional instability elements, both in the 5′-protein-coding region. Hence, ftzmRNA has three redundant destabilizing elements, each of which is sufficient to promote mRNA degradation in early embryos. Although the significance of the occurrence of three redundant elements in the same message can only be speculated on, redundancy may be tied to the fact that ftz mRNA instability is crucial for normal embryonic development (see the Introduction). The half-life of a hybrid mRNA containing FIE3 was previously estimated to be about 50 min (12Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3047-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study we estimated the half-life of the FIE5-1-containing s-b mRNA and the FIE5-2-containing s-c mRNA to be about 51 and 65 min, respectively. 3J. Ito and M. Jacobs-Lorena, unpublished observations. Thus, each element appears to have similar “strength.” Each element can act independently, and we found no evidence that the destabilizing activity of these elements is additive or synergistic. The estimated half-lives cited above are significantly longer than the 14–6-min half-life reported previously for the endogenous ftzmRNA (8/deleted in proof.Google Scholar). One reason for this difference may be that our measurements started early during embryonic development (from fertilization to 4 h), whereas endogenous ftztranscription occurs between 1.5 and ∼4.5 h. The gradual decrease offtz mRNA half-life from 14 to 6 min between 2.5 and 4 h of development (8/deleted in proof.Google Scholar) suggests that degrading activity increases as embryonic development progresses. Thus, the degrading activity may be low at the very beginning of embryogenesis. Another conceivable reason for the difference in estimated half-lives might be the cytoplasmic localization of the mRNAs (28Mason J.O. Williams G.T. Neuberger M.S. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Zambetti G. Stein J. Stein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2683-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Endogenousftz mRNA is located in the apical cytoplasm, whereas the distribution of the hybrid mRNAs in the transgenic embryos is unknown (30Fontes A.M. Ito J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 44: 171-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Apical localization requires the last 53 nucleotides of the ftz 3′ UTR (31Davis I. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1991; 67: 927-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Lall S. Francis-Lang H. Flament A. Norvell A. Schüpbach T. Ish-Horowics D. Cell. 1999; 98: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), 43 nucleotides of which overlap with FIE3. Deletion of FIE3 (which comprises most of the apical localization sequence) in ftz+aldB-FIE3 did not seem to substantially affect stability when compared with the FIE3-containing ftz+aldB mRNA, suggesting that mRNA stability and localization are independent of each other. The r-abc and s-abc mRNAs both contain the identical 5′-ftz sequence; yet their stability in the early embryo differs dramatically. The main difference between the two mRNAs is the position of the ftz sequences within the mRNA: in the 3′ UTR for r-abc and in the original 5′-position for s-abc. Therefore, the structure and sequence of the RNA elements are not sufficient for destabilizing activity, and position within the mRNA is crucial. Note that when FIE3 was inserted at the same position in the rpA1 3′ UTR as were the FIE5s in r-abc, FIE3 had full destabilizing activity. Thus, FIE3 is active, and FIE5s are inactive when inserted at the identical position of the rpA1mRNA. These results suggest that FIE5s and FIE3 destabilize mRNAs by different mechanisms. This position dependence of the FIE5 elements suggests that translation is required for degradation to occur. Precedents exist for a connection between mRNA stability and translation (30Fontes A.M. Ito J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 44: 171-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Hennigan A.N. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Oliveira C.C. McCarthy J.E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8936-8943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Schiavi S.C. Wellington C.L. Shyu A.-B. Chen C.-Y.A. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. J. Biol.

The suggested dependence of FIE5 activity on mRNA translation is consistent with the results of Edgar et al. (8/deleted in proof.Google Scholar), who reported that general inhibition of embryonic protein synthesis by cycloheximide injection stabilizes the ftzmRNA. However, these results do not rule out the alternative possibility that cycloheximide prevents the synthesis of an unstable protein required for mRNA degradation. The three cis-acting ftz instability elements are likely to act by providing a binding site for a factor or a protein complex that mediates mRNA degradation. A sequence comparison among the three elements and a search for similarity with sequences deposited in data bases did not yield any significant homologies. Binding sites could be recognized as secondary structures rather than primary sequences (37Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no stable secondary structure that has more than a four-base straight stem or a common secondary structure among the three elements was predicted when a computer program of Zuker (26Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 38Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288 (presence of 41 additional sgs3-encoded nucleotides at the 5′-end of all): 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar) was used to fold these sequences. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of certain nucleotides within FIE3 did not alter the destabilizing activity of this element.2 Thus, it is presently unclear how these cis-acting elements are recognized in the embryo. Recently, a protein that binds to the ftz apical localization element was identified (32Lall S. Francis-Lang H. Flament A. Norvell A. Schüpbach T. Ish-Horowics D. Cell. 1999; 98: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The identification of proteins that recognize the three instability elements characterized in this and in previous work will bring significant insights to the questions of sequence recognition and mechanism of RNA degradation.
