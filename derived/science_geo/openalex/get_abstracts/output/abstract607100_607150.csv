https://openalex.org/W2791599654,"Interleukin (IL-)6 is the major pro-inflammatory cytokine within the IL-6 family. IL-6 signals via glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and the membrane-bound or soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), referred to as classic or trans-signaling, respectively. Whereas inflammation triggers IL-6 expression, eventually rising to nanogram/ml serum levels, soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) and soluble gp130 (sgp130) are constitutively present in the upper nanogram/ml range. Calculations based on intermolecular affinities have suggested that systemic IL-6 is immediately trapped in IL-6·sIL-6R and IL-6·sIL-6R·sgp130 complexes, indicating that sIL-6R and sgp130 constitute a buffer system that increases the serum half-life of IL-6 or restricts systemic IL-6 signaling. However, this scenario has not been experimentally validated. Here, we quantified IL-6·sIL-6R and IL-6·sIL-6R·sgp130 complexes over a wide concentration range. The amounts of IL-6 used in this study reflect concentrations found during active inflammatory events. Our results indicated that most IL-6 is free and not complexed with sIL-6R or sgp130, indicating that the level of endogenous sgp130 in the bloodstream is not sufficient to block IL-6 trans-signaling via sIL-6R. Importantly, addition of the single-domain antibody VHH6, which specifically stabilizes IL-6·sIL-6R complexes but did not bind to IL-6 or sIL-6R alone, drove free IL-6 into IL-6·sIL-6R complexes and boosted trans-signaling but not classic signaling, demonstrating that endogenous sIL-6R has at least the potential to form complexes with IL-6. Our findings indicate that even though high concentrations of sIL-6R and sgp130 are present in human serum, the relative ratio of free IL-6 to IL-6·sIL-6R allows for simultaneous classic and trans-signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2790225110,"There are widespread concerns about abuse of care home residents. We report, in the largest care home survey, prevalence of staff anonymously-reported, perpetrated/witnessed abusive behaviours towards care home residents over 3 months. We also report positive care behaviours.1544 staff in 92 English care home units completed the revised Modified Conflict Tactics Scale and Maslach Burnout Inventory.Most staff reported positive care behaviours, but specific person-centred activities were sometimes infrequent. Many care home staff were never or almost never aware of a resident being taken out of the home for their enjoyment (34%, n = 520); or an activity planned around a resident's interests (15%, n = 234). 763 (51%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 47% to 54%) of care home staff reported carrying out or observing potentially abusive or neglectful behaviours at least sometimes in the preceding 3 months; some abuse was reported as happening ""at least sometimes"" in 91/92 care homes. Neglect was most frequently reported: making a resident wait for care (n = 399, 26%), avoiding a resident with challenging behaviour (n = 391, 25%), giving residents insufficient time for food (n = 297, 19%), and taking insufficient care when moving residents (n = 169, 11%). 1.1% of staff reported physical and 5% verbal abuse. More staff reported abusive/neglectful behaviour in homes with higher staff burnout-depersonalisation scores (adjusted odds ratio 1.191, CI 1.052-1.349).Staff anonymous reports of abusive behaviour and neglect could be used to monitor care quality, as cases currently reported are probably tip of the iceberg, and be an outcome in intervention studies."

https://openalex.org/W2795372495,"Chemoresistance remains a major obstacle to successful treatment of breast cancer. Although soluble tumor necrosis factor-α (sTNF-α) has been implicated in mediating drug-resistance in human cancers, whether transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-α (tmTNF-α) plays a role in chemoresistance remains unclear. Here we found that over 50% of studied patients expressed tmTNF-α at high levels in breast cancer tissues and tmTNF-α expression positively correlated with resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. Alteration of tmTNF-α expression changed the sensitivity of primary human breast cancer cells and breast cancer cell lines to doxorubicin (DOX). Overexpression of N-terminal fragment (NTF) of tmTNF-α, a mutant form with intact intracellular domain of tmTNF-α to transmit reverse signals, induced DOX-resistance. Mechanistically, the tmTNF-α/NTF-ERK-GST-π axis and tmTNF-α/NTF-NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic functions were required for tmTNF-α-induced DOX-resistance. In a xenograft mouse model, the combination of tmTNF-α suppression with chemotherapy significantly enhanced the efficacy of DOX. Our data indicate that tmTNF-α mediates DOX-resistance through reverse signaling and targeting tmTNF-α may be beneficial for the treatment of DOX-resistant breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2794407781,"Background Except for the northern region, where the Amazonian black scorpion, T. obscurus, represents the predominant and most medically relevant scorpion species, Tityus serrulatus, the Brazilian yellow scorpion, is widely distributed throughout Brazil, causing most envenoming and fatalities due to scorpion sting. In order to evaluate and compare the diversity of venom components of Tityus obscurus and T. serrulatus, we performed a transcriptomic investigation of the telsons (venom glands) corroborated by a shotgun proteomic analysis of the venom from the two species. Results The putative venom components represented 11.4% and 16.7% of the total gene expression for T. obscurus and T. serrulatus, respectively. Transcriptome and proteome data revealed high abundance of metalloproteinases sequences followed by sodium and potassium channel toxins, making the toxin core of the venom. The phylogenetic analysis of metalloproteinases from T. obscurus and T. serrulatus suggested an intraspecific gene expansion, as we previously observed for T. bahiensis, indicating that this enzyme may be under evolutionary pressure for diversification. We also identified several putative venom components such as anionic peptides, antimicrobial peptides, bradykinin-potentiating peptide, cysteine rich protein, serine proteinases, cathepsins, angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelin-converting enzyme and chymotrypsin like protein, proteinases inhibitors, phospholipases and hyaluronidases. Conclusion The present work shows that the venom composition of these two allopatric species of Tityus are considerably similar in terms of the major classes of proteins produced and secreted, although their individual toxin sequences are considerably divergent. These differences at amino acid level may reflect in different epitopes for the same protein classes in each species, explaining the basis for the poor recognition of T. obscurus venom by the antiserum raised against other species."
https://openalex.org/W2792421777,"Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies. The presence and the abundance of taxa in aerobiological samples can be very variable and impaired by changeable climatic conditions. Because many fungi produce mycotoxins and both their mycelium fragments and spores are potential allergens, monitoring the presence of these taxa is of key importance. So far data on exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens are mainly based on the assessment of few, easily identifiable taxa and focused only on certain environments. The microscopic method used to analyze aerobiological samples and the inconspicuous fungal characters do not allow a in depth taxonomical identification. Here, we present a first assessment of fungal diversity from airborne samples using a DNA metabarcoding analysis. The nuclear ITS2 region was selected as barcode to catch fungal diversity in mixed airborne samples gathered during two weeks in four sites of North-Eastern and Central Italy. We assessed the taxonomic composition and diversity within and among the sampled sites and compared the molecular data with those obtained by traditional microscopy. The molecular analyses provide a tenfold more comprehensive determination of the taxa than the traditional morphological inspections. Our results prove that the metabarcoding analysis is a promising approach to increases quality and sensitivity of the aerobiological monitoring. The laboratory and bioinformatic workflow implemented here is now suitable for routine, high-throughput, regional analyses of airborne fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2791636384,"Hyaluronan is abundant in the extracellular matrix of many desmoplastic tumors and determines in large part the tumor biochemical and mechanical microenvironment. Additionally, it has been identified as one of the major physiological barriers to the effective delivery of drugs to solid tumors and its targeting with the use of pharmaceutical agents has shown to decompress tumor blood vessels, and thus improve tumor perfusion and efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. In this study, we investigated the contribution of hyaluronan to the accumulation of mechanical forces in tumors. Using experimental data from two orthotopic breast tumor models and treating tumors with two clinically approved anti-fibrotic drugs (tranilast and pirfenidone), we found that accumulation of growth-induced, residual forces in tumors are associated with hyaluronan content. Furthermore, mechanical characterization of the tumors revealed a good correlation of the accumulated forces with the elastic modulus of the tissue. Our results provide important insights on the mechano-pathology of solid tumors and can be used for the design of therapeutic strategies that target hyaluronan."
https://openalex.org/W2789290221,"Genetic factors are known to significantly contribute to the etiology of psychiatric diseases such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum and bipolar disorders, but the underlying molecular processes remain largely elusive. The dopamine transporter (DAT) has received continuous attention as a potential risk factor for psychiatric disease, as it is critical for dopamine homeostasis and serves as principal target for ADHD medications. Constrain metrics for the DAT-encoding gene, solute carrier family 6 member 3 (SLC6A3), indicate that missense mutations are under strong negative selection, pointing to pathophysiological outcomes when DAT function is compromised. Here, we systematically characterized six rare genetic variants of DAT (I312F, T356M, D421N, A559V, E602G, and R615C) identified in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. We evaluated dopamine uptake and ligand interactions, along with ion coordination and electrophysiological properties, to elucidate functional phenotypes, and applied Zn2+ exposure and a substituted cysteine–accessibility approach to identify shared structural changes. Three variants (I312F, T356M, and D421N) exhibited impaired dopamine uptake associated with changes in ligand binding, ion coordination, and distinct conformational disturbances. Remarkably, we found that all three variants displayed gain-of-function electrophysiological phenotypes. I312F mediated an increased uncoupled anion conductance previously suggested to modulate neuronal excitability. T356M and D421N both mediated a cocaine-sensitive leakage of cations, which for T356M was potentiated by Zn2+, concurrent with partial functional rescue. Collectively, our findings support that gain of disruptive functions due to missense mutations in SLC6A3 may be key to understanding how dopaminergic dyshomeostasis arises in heterozygous carriers.

The main purpose of this study was to prevent mine accidents more effectively by proposing a composite risk analysis model. First, the weights of the assessment indicators were determined by the revised integrated weight method, in which the objective weights were determined by a variation coefficient method and the subjective weights determined by the Delphi method. A new formula was then adopted to calculate the integrated weights based on the subjective and objective weights. Second, after the assessment indicator weights were determined, gray relational analysis was used to evaluate the safety of mine enterprises. Mine enterprise safety was ranked according to the gray relational degree, and weak links of mine safety practices identified based on gray relational analysis. Third, to validate the revised integrated weight method adopted in the process of gray relational analysis, the fuzzy evaluation method was used to the safety assessment of mine enterprises. Fourth, for first time, bow tie model was adopted to identify the causes and consequences of weak links and allow corresponding safety measures to be taken to guarantee the mine’s safe production. A case study of mine safety assessment was presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed composite risk analysis model, which can be applied to other related industries for safety evaluation."

https://openalex.org/W2792011518,"Wind turbines represent a source of hazard for bats, especially through collision with rotor blades. With increasing technical development, tall turbines (rotor-swept zone 50–150 m above ground level) are becoming widespread, yet we lack quantitative information about species active at these heights, which impedes proposing targeted mitigation recommendations for bat-friendly turbine operation. We investigated vertical activity profiles of a bat assemblage, and their relationships to wind speed, within a major valley of the European Alps where tall wind turbines are being deployed. To monitor bat activity we installed automatic recorders at sequentially increasing heights from ground level up to 65 m, with the goal to determine species-specific vertical activity profiles and to link them to wind speed. Bat call sequences were analysed with an automatic algorithm, paying particular attention to mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii) and the European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis), three locally rare species. The most often recorded bats were the Common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Mouse-eared bats were rarely recorded, and mostly just above ground, appearing out of risk of collision. T. teniotis had a more evenly distributed vertical activity profile, often being active at rotor level, but its activity at that height ceased above 5 ms-1 wind speed. Overall bat activity in the rotor-swept zone declined with increasing wind speed, dropping below 5% above 5.4 ms-1. Collision risk could be drastically reduced if nocturnal operation of tall wind turbines would be restricted to wind speeds above 5 ms-1. Such measure should be implemented year-round because T. teniotis remains active in winter. This operational restriction is likely to cause only small energy production losses at these tall wind turbines, although further analyses are needed to assess these losses precisely."
https://openalex.org/W2792808032,"Previous evidence has identified potential racial disparities in access to community water and sewer service in peri-urban areas adjacent to North Carolina municipalities. We performed the first quantitative, multi-county analysis of these disparities. Using publicly available data, we identified areas bordering municipalities and lacking community water and/or sewer service in 75 North Carolina counties. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the relationship between race and access to service in peri-urban areas, controlling for population density, median home value, urban status, and percent white in the adjacent municipality. In the peri-urban areas analyzed, 67% of the population lacked community sewer service, and 33% lacked community water service. In areas other than those with no black residents, odds of having community water service (p<0.01) or at least one of the two services (p<0.05) were highest for census blocks with a small proportion of black residents and lowest in 100% black census blocks, though this trend did not hold for access to community sewer service alone. For example, odds of community water service were 85% higher in areas that were greater than 0% but less than 22% black than in 100% black areas (p<0.001). Peri-urban census blocks without black populations had the lowest odds of community water service, community sewer service, and at least one of the two services, but this difference was only statistically significant for sewer. Peri-urban areas lacking service with no black residents were wealthier than 100% black areas and areas with any percent black greater than 0%. Findings suggest two unserved groups of differing racial and socioeconomic status: (1) lower-income black populations potentially excluded from municipal services during the era of legal racial segregation and (2) higher-income non-black populations. Findings also suggest greater racial disparities in community water than community sewer services statewide."
https://openalex.org/W2790433792,"Birds in U.S. national parks find strong protection from many longstanding and pervasive threats, but remain highly exposed to effects of ongoing climate change. To understand how climate change is likely to alter bird communities in parks, we used species distribution models relating North American Breeding Bird Survey (summer) and Audubon Christmas Bird Count (winter) observations to climate data from the early 2000s and projected to 2041-2070 (hereafter, mid-century) under high and low greenhouse gas concentration trajectories, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6. We analyzed climate suitability projections over time for 513 species across 274 national parks, classifying them as improving, worsening, stable, potential colonization, and potential extirpation. U.S. national parks are projected to become increasingly important for birds in the coming decades as potential colonizations exceed extirpations in 62-100% of parks, with an average ratio of potential colonizations to extirpations of 4.1 in winter and 1.4 in summer under RCP8.5. Average species turnover is 23% in both summer and winter under RCP8.5. Species turnover (Bray-Curtis) and potential colonization and extirpation rates are positively correlated with latitude in the contiguous 48 states. Parks in the Midwest and Northeast are expected to see particularly high rates of change. All patterns are more extreme under RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6. Based on the ratio of potential colonization and extirpation, parks were classified into overall trend groups associated with specific climate-informed conservation strategies. Substantial change to bird and ecological communities is anticipated in coming decades, and current thinking suggests managing towards a forward-looking concept of ecological integrity that accepts change and novel ecological conditions, rather than focusing management goals exclusively on maintaining or restoring a static set of historical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2792768117,"With fewer than 200 tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) left in Nepal, that are generally confined to five protected areas across the Terai Arc Landscape, genetic studies are needed to provide crucial information on diversity and connectivity for devising an effective country-wide tiger conservation strategy. As part of the Nepal Tiger Genome Project, we studied landscape change, genetic variation, population structure, and gene flow of tigers across the Terai Arc Landscape by conducting Nepal’s first comprehensive and systematic scat-based, non-invasive genetic survey. Of the 770 scat samples collected opportunistically from five protected areas and six presumed corridors, 412 were tiger (57%). Out of ten microsatellite loci, we retain eight markers that were used in identifying 78 individual tigers. We used this dataset to examine population structure, genetic variation, contemporary gene flow, and potential population bottlenecks of tigers in Nepal. We detected three genetic clusters consistent with three demographic sub-populations and found moderate levels of genetic variation (He = 0.61, AR = 3.51) and genetic differentiation (FST = 0.14) across the landscape. We detected 3–7 migrants, confirming the potential for dispersal-mediated gene flow across the landscape. We found evidence of a bottleneck signature likely caused by large-scale land-use change documented in the last two centuries in the Terai forest. Securing tiger habitat including functional forest corridors is essential to enhance gene flow across the landscape and ensure long-term tiger survival. This requires cooperation among multiple stakeholders and careful conservation planning to prevent detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities on tigers."
https://openalex.org/W2794195016,"Insular wildlife is more prone to extinction than their mainland relatives. Thus, a basic understanding of non-natural mortality sources is the first step in the development of conservation management plans. The Canary Islands are an important tourist destination due to their unique climate and rich scenery and biodiversity. During the last few decades, there has been significant development of urban areas and busy road networks. However, there have been no studies describing the effects of road mortality on wildlife in this archipelago. We describe the temporal and spatial patterns of wildlife roadkill in Lanzarote (UNESCO Biosphere Reserve), using counts from cars for an entire annual cycle. A total of 666 roadkills were recorded (monthly average of 0.09 birds/km and 0.14 mammals/km) comprising at least 37 species including native birds and introduced mammals. Seasonal abundance, richness and diversity of roadkills showed a high peak during summer months for both mammals and birds. GLMs indicated that accidents (including birds and mammals) have a higher probability of occurrence close to houses and on roads with high speed limits. When analysed separately, mammal kills occurred in sectors with high speed limits, close to houses and in areas surrounded by exotic bushes, while bird roadkills appeared in road sectors with high speed limits, close to houses and low traffic volume. Our findings highlight that roads are a potential threat to native birds in the eastern Canary Islands. Detailed studies on the local population dynamics of highly affected species, such as the Houbara Bustard, Eurasian Stone Curlew, Barn Owl or Southern Shrike, are urgently needed to determine whether these levels of road mortality are sustainable."
https://openalex.org/W2791779962,"Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and “reclaimed” for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canada’s Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2789495149,"This paper calculates the distribution of an adjusted measure of income that deducts damages due to exposure to air pollution from reported market income in the United States from 2011 to 2014. The Gini coefficient for this measure of adjusted income is 0.682 in 2011, as compared to 0.482 for market income. By 2014, we estimate that the Gini for adjusted income fell to 0.646, while the market income Gini did not appreciably change. The inclusion of air pollution damage acts like a regressive tax: with air pollution, the bottom 20% of households lose roughly 10% of the share of income, while the top 20% of households gain 10%. We find that, unlike the case for market income, New England is not the most unequal division with respect to adjusted income. Further, the difference between adjusted income for white and Hispanics is smaller than expected. However, the gap in augmented income between whites and African-Americans is widening."
https://openalex.org/W2790746098,"Cryptochromes 1 and 2 (CRY1/2) are key components of the negative limb of the mammalian circadian clock. Like many peripheral tissues, Cry1 and -2 are expressed in the retina, where they are thought to play a role in regulating rhythmic physiology. However, studies differ in consensus as to their localization and function, and CRY1 immunostaining has not been convincingly demonstrated in the retina. Here we describe the expression and function of CRY1 and -2 in the mouse retina in both sexes. Unexpectedly, we show that CRY1 is expressed throughout all retinal layers, whereas CRY2 is restricted to the photoreceptor layer. Retinal period 2::luciferase recordings from CRY1-deficient mice show reduced clock robustness and stability, while those from CRY2-deficient mice show normal, albeit long-period, rhythms. In functional studies, we then investigated well-defined rhythms in retinal physiology. Rhythms in the photopic electroretinogram, contrast sensitivity, and pupillary light response were all severely attenuated or abolished in CRY1-deficient mice. In contrast, these physiological rhythms are largely unaffected in mice lacking CRY2, and only photopic electroretinogram rhythms are affected. Together, our data suggest that CRY1 is an essential component of the mammalian retinal clock, whereas CRY2 has a more limited role.-Wong, J. C. Y., Smyllie, N. J., Banks, G. T., Pothecary, C.

https://openalex.org/W2790131623,"In wild vertebrates, young parents are less likely to successfully rear offspring relative to older ones because of lower parental skills (‘the constraint hypothesis’), lower parental investment (‘the restraint hypothesis’) or because of a progressive disappearance of lower-quality individuals at young ages (‘the selection hypothesis’). Because it is practically difficult to follow an offspring during its entire life, most studies have only focused on the ability of individuals to breed or produce young, while neglecting the ability of such young to subsequently survive and reproduce. Several proxies of individual quality can be useful to assess the ability of young to survive and recruit into the population. Among them, telomere length measurement appears especially promising because telomere length has been linked to longevity and fitness in captive and wild animals. By sampling 51 chicks reared by known-aged parents, we specifically tested whether parental age was correlated to offspring telomere length and body condition in a long-lived bird species, the Black-browed Albatross (Thalassarche melanophrys). Young Black-browed albatrosses produced chicks with shorter telomere relative to those raised by older ones. Short offspring telomeres could result from poor developmental conditions or heritability of telomere length. Moreover, young parents also had chicks of lower body condition when compared with older parents, although this effect was significant in female offspring only. Overall, our study demonstrates that parental age is correlated to two proxies of offspring fitness (body condition and telomere length), suggesting therefore that older individuals provide better parental cares to their offspring because of increased parental investment (restraint hypothesis), better foraging/parental skills (constraint hypothesis) or because only high-quality individuals reach older ages (selection hypothesis)."

In this study, we describe a comprehensive genome and transcriptome-wide analysis of proteins involved in mRNA maturation, translation, and mRNA decay across representative organisms from the six eukaryotic super-groups. We demonstrate that eukaryotes share common pathways for mRNA metabolism that were almost certainly present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, and show for the first time a correlation between intron density and a selective absence of some Exon Junction Complex (EJC) components in eukaryotes.

In contrast, the role of each amino acid in the simple maquette structure has been rationalized at the outset, so changes to structure and function become more predictable. The maquettes used in this study are based on the BT6 maquette developed by Farid et al. (28Farid T.A. Kodali G. Solomon L.A. Lichtenstein B.R. Sheehan M.M. Fry B.A. Bialas C. Ennist N.M.

Histidine residues within the maquette cavity ligate hemes, producing artificial proteins resembling b-type cytochromes and myoglobin (29Choma C.T. Lear J.D. Nelson M.J. Dutton P.L. Robertson D.E.

Here, three different maquette variants were utilized, each with a different heme b binding capacity (Fig. 1). Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy we show that binding two, one, or no hemes (Fig. 1, A–C, respectively) imparts changes in the extent of folding of the maquette variants. The archetypal trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (TorA) Tat signal peptide was fused to the N terminus of the three proteins and the E. coli Tat machinery was challenged to differentiate between the folding variants. We show that the Tat apparatus is able to sense the conformational flexibility of the different maquette substrates, and that increasingly well-folded maquettes are exported with enhanced efficiency. The aim of this study was to test whether the E. coli Tat system could recognize and export a de novo–designed di-heme protein, and then to use variants of this protein with experimentally confirmed differences in conformational flexibility to test if the Tat apparatus selectively processes the more folded proteins. As described above and depicted in the computationally-generated structures presented in Fig. 1, three variants of the BT6 maquette were produced, facilitating the incorporation of two (BT6), one (BT6M1), or no (BT6M0) heme b cofactors. The requirement for bis-histidine ligation of heme b in the artificial constructs enabled the generation of the one and no heme-binding variants through H53A, and H53A/H88A (histidine to alanine) point mutations, respectively (Table 1). The computational models in Fig. 1 extend the theoretical structure of the BT6 maquette outlined by Farid et al. (28Farid T.A. Kodali G. Solomon L.A. Lichtenstein B.R. Sheehan M.M. Fry B.A. Bialas C.

Open table in a new tab Maquettes are typically overproduced in E. coli in large amounts, with bound heme largely absent following purification (see “Experimental procedures”) because the native tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway cannot keep pace with the induced synthesis of maquette (Fig. S1A). Apoproteins were reconstituted in vitro with an excess of heme and unbound pigment was removed by anion exchange chromatography. The Soret absorption bands for the BT6, BT6M1, and BT6M0 maquettes were normalized for protein concentration (absorbance at 280 nm) and had maxima at 413, 412, and 396 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A), with the amplitudes corresponding to binding two, one, and no hemes, respectively. The weak, blue-shifted absorption of the BT6M0 maquette suggested a low level of adventitiously bound heme. We compared heme absorption in the maquette-bound, and solvated (buffer or DMSO) states, which had respective maxima at 413, 404, and 384 nm (Fig. S1B). The blue-shifted absorption maxima for solvated heme are consistent with the weak, blue-shifted absorption for BT6M0 (Fig. 2A) arising from residual, weakly bound heme; ligation into the internal cavity of BT6 and BT6M1 causes a red-shift absorption of the heme. Temperature-dependent CD spectroscopy was performed to assess the effect of heme ligation on the thermal stability of each maquette scaffold. At 15 °C the CD spectra of all three maquette variants, with or without bound heme, were typical of α-helical structures (Fig. S2, black lines). Likewise, irrespective of heme binding heating to 80 °C resulted in spectra typical of that of a denatured protein (31Greenfield N.J. Using circular dichroism collected as a function of temperature to determine the thermodynamics of protein unfolding and binding interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 (17406506): 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2, from black to red to gray lines). Ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored during temperature cycling from 15 to 80 to 15 °C to observe denaturing and subsequent re-folding of protein (Fig. 2, B–D). For BT6, heme incorporation displaced the midpoint of the melting curve from 22 to 56 °C, the 34 °C difference indicating increased stabilization following heme binding. The same procedure with BT6M1 increased stabilization by only 16 °C (25 to 41 °C), and had very little effect on the BT6M0 scaffold (32 to 35 °C) (Table 2). Thus, bis-histidine ligation of two hemes within the maquette cavity of BT6 significantly stabilizes the four-helix bundle structure, and there is a smaller effect with only one bis-histidine ligation in BT6M1. In the case of BT6M0, where heme ligation is not possible, there is correspondingly no significant stabilization of maquette structure in the presence of heme.Table 2Melting temperatures (Tm) and folding temperatures (Tf) of maquettes in the absence (apo) or presence of hemeMaquetteApo+HemeTmaThe Tm and Tf (temperature at which 50% of the protein is unfolded or folded, respectively) values were determined from Boltzman distribution fits as shown in Fig. 2, B–D.TfTmTf°C°CBT622175654BT6M125244139BT6M032323536a The Tm and Tf (temperature at which 50% of the protein is unfolded or folded, respectively) values were determined from Boltzman distribution fits as shown in Fig. 2, B–D. Open table in a new tab One-dimensional proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy was used to assess conformational changes in tertiary structure upon heme binding to maquettes. A 1H NMR spectrum characteristic of a protein with limited tertiary structure was observed for all maquette scaffolds in the absence of heme (Fig. 3A, Fig. S3). Addition of heme to BT6 showed greater dispersion of resonances in the amide proton region, with a notable increase in the number of peaks at around 10 ppm, suggesting that the heme is binding to the scaffold and stabilizing the protein tertiary structure (Fig. 3B). BT6M1 showed a small increase in resonance dispersion following heme addition (Fig. 3C), whereas BT6M0 showed no significant change in amide proton dispersion (Fig. 3D). The increase in the chemical shift dispersion observed in the methyl proton region (at around 1.0–0.0 ppm) for BT6, BT6M1, and BT6M0 mirrored the behavior observed for the amide proton resonances (Fig. S4). Together, the increase in 1H NMR dispersion in both backbone amide and methyl regions confirm the ligation of heme into the BT6 and BT6M1 variants and indicate an increase in protein folding upon ligation. These results are consistent with a previous NMR study that showed poor dispersion for a related apo-maquette, and progressive structuring of the maquette when 1 then 2 eq of heme were added (28Farid T.A.

Constructs in which the sequence encoding the TorA signal peptide (residues 1–39) and first 4 amino acids of the mature TorA protein (residues 40–43) were added in-frame to the 5′ terminus of the genes encoding the BT6 maquette variants followed by a C-terminal His6 tag (Fig. S5) were synthesized and cloned into the pEXT22 vector (Table S1). In the TorA–BT6 variants residues His-95 and His-130 correspond to His-53 and His-88 in the maquette scaffolds presented in Fig. 1. The resulting plasmids were co-transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) along with empty pET-21a(+).

Following growth and protein production, periplasmic fractions were prepared from harvested cells as described under “Experimental procedures” and analyzed alongside cell-free extracts prepared from identically grown cells. The C-terminal His6 tag allows immunodetection of the recombinant protein; the predicted molecular mass of the unprocessed precursor protein is ∼21 kDa, whereas the Tat-processed mature protein is ∼17 kDa. Anti-GroEL was used to probe the degree of cytoplasmic contamination in the periplasmic preparations (Fig. 4A); for all samples only a faint signal was detectable in the periplasm compared with that detected in cell-free extracts, indicating the level of contamination was very low. The Tat export assays were performed in cells that also maintained the pET-21a(+) vector, allowing immunoblot signals to be normalized by immunodetection of β-lactamase (Fig. 4B), allowing direct comparison of the degree of Tat transport between samples. For TorA–BT6, a 17-kDa signal was present for both periplasmic and cell-free extract (Fig. 4C) preparations with no signal detected at 21 kDa, indicating complete processing and export of TorA–BT6. To confirm the periplasmic localization was Tat-dependent, a R12K/R13K (KK) variant of the TorA signal peptide was generated and fused to BT6 (Table 1); it has previously been demonstrated that the KK motif completely abolishes Tat-transport (12Halbig D.

When this construct was tested, a 21-kDa signal corresponding to the unprocessed apoprotein is observed in blots of total lysates and no processed protein was detectable in the periplasm (Fig. 4C). Together these data indicate that the BT6 scaffold is able to acquire heme from the native biosynthetic pathway and fold in vivo, and that this folding event can be detected by the Tat system, with the TorA signal peptide sufficient for Tat-mediated recognition and transport of heme-loaded BT6 to the E. coli periplasm. To probe the proofreading ability of the Tat machinery to recognize and efficiently export only folded proteins, similar constructs were generated in which the TorA signal peptide was fused to the BT6M1 and BT6M0 maquettes, which, in the presence of heme, are either partially folded (BT6M1) or unfolded (BT6M0) relative to BT6 (Figure 2, Figure 3). Compared with BT6, considerably less protein was found in the periplasm for BT6M1, and almost none for BT6M0 (Fig. 4C). Conversely, blots of cell-free extracts of the same strains reveal a significant signal for the unprocessed maquettes for BT6M0, and to a lesser extent BT6M1, as observed for the TorA–KK–BT6 control, showing that the preprotein accumulates in the cytoplasm when it is less well folded (Fig. 4B). The cellular levels of maquette variants should be very similar as all the proteins are identical apart from 1 or 2 point mutations and were expressed from the same plasmid in the same cell line under the same conditions. Indeed, the data presented in Fig. 4C shows that the total signal (preprotein plus exported protein where relevant) for all three maquettes is similar. However, to further confirm that the differential periplasmic targeting of the three BT6 variants by the Tat system was due to differences in their heme loading and associated folding and not in expression, synthesis, or stability, we performed two additional control experiments. First we produced each maquette under the same conditions as for t"
https://openalex.org/W2793337729,"Seed dispersal is a key process driving the structure, composition, and regeneration of tropical forests. Larger frugivores play a crucial role in community structuring by dispersing large seeds not dispersed by smaller frugivores. We assessed the hypothesis that brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans) provide seed dispersal services for a wide assemblage of plant species in both small and large Atlantic forest fragments. Although fruit availability often decreases in small fragments compared with large ones, we predicted that brown howlers are efficient seed dispersers in quantitative and qualitative terms in both forest types given their high dietary flexibility. After a 36-month study period and 2,962 sampling hours, we found that howlers swallowed and defecated intact the vast majority of seeds (96%-100%) they handled in all study sites. Overall, they defecated ca. 315,600 seeds belonging to 98 species distributed in eight growth forms. We estimated that each individual howler dispersed an average of 143 (SD = 49) seeds >2 mm per day or 52,052 (SD = 17,782) seeds per year. They dispersed seeds of 58% to 93% of the local assemblages of fleshy-fruit trees. In most cases, the richness and abundance of seed species dispersed was similar between small and large fragments. However, groups inhabiting small fragments tended to disperse a higher diversity of seeds from rarely consumed fruits than those living in large fragments. We conclude that brown howlers are legitimate seed dispersers for most fleshy-fruit species of the angiosperm assemblages of their habitats, and that they might favor the regeneration of Atlantic forest fragments with the plentiful amount of intact seeds that they disperse each year."
https://openalex.org/W2735567063,"X-ray and γ-ray photons have been widely used for studying radiobiological effects of ionizing radiations. Photons are indirectly ionizing radiations so they need to set in motion electrons (which are a directly ionizing radiation) to perform the ionizations. When the photon dose decreases to below a certain limit, the number of electrons set in motion will become so small that not all cells in an “exposed” cell population can get at least one electron hit. When some cells in a cell population are not hit by a directly ionizing radiation (in other words not irradiated), there will be rescue effect between the irradiated cells and non-irradiated cells, and the resultant radiobiological effect observed for the “exposed” cell population will be different. In the present paper, the mechanisms underlying photon interactions in radiobiological experiments were studied using our developed NRUphoton computer code, which was benchmarked against the MCNP5 code by comparing the photon dose delivered to the cell layer underneath the water medium. The following conclusions were reached: (1) The interaction fractions decreased in the following order: 16O > 12C > 14N > 1H. Bulges in the interaction fractions (versus water medium thickness) were observed, which reflected changes in the energies of the propagating photons due to traversals of different amount of water medium as well as changes in the energy-dependent photon interaction cross-sections. (2) Photoelectric interaction and incoherent scattering dominated for lower-energy (10 keV) and high-energy (100 keV and 1 MeV) incident photons. (3) The fractions of electron ejection from different nuclei were mainly governed by the photoelectric effect cross-sections, and the fractions from the 1s subshell were the largest. (4) The penetration fractions in general decreased with increasing medium thickness, and increased with increasing incident photon energy, the latter being explained by the corresponding reduction in interaction cross-sections. (5) The areas under the angular distribution curves of photons exiting the medium layer and subsequently undergoing interactions within the cell layer became smaller for larger incident photon energies. (6) The number of cells suffering at least one electron hit increased with the administered dose. For larger incident photon energies, the numbers of cells suffering at least one electron hit became smaller, which was attributed to the reduction in the photon interaction cross-section. These results highlighted the importance of the administered dose in radiobiological experiments. In particular, the threshold administered doses at which all cells in the exposed cell array suffered at least one electron hit might provide hints on explaining the intriguing observation that radiation-induced cancers can be statistically detected only above the threshold value of ~100 mSv, and thus on reconciling controversies over the linear no-threshold model."
https://openalex.org/W2790299333,"Background Identifying patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery at high risk of Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infection (SSI) is a prerequisite for implementing effective preventive interventions. The objective of this study was to develop a risk prediction model for S. aureus SSI or bacteremia after cardiothoracic surgery based on pre-operative variables. Materials/Methods Data from the Merck Phase IIb/III S. aureus vaccine (V710-P003) clinical trial were analyzed. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, the effect of preoperative vaccination against S. aureus was investigated in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. The primary outcome was deep/superficial S. aureus SSI or S. aureus bacteremia through day 90 after surgery. Performance, calibration, and discrimination of the final model were assessed. Results Overall 164 out of 7,647 included patients (2.1%) developed S. aureus infection (149 SSI, 15 bacteremia, 28 both). Independent risk factors for developing the primary outcome were pre-operative colonization with S. aureus (OR 3.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23–4.22), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.34–2.60), BMI (OR 1.02 per kg/m2, 95% CI 0.99–1.05), and CABG (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.91–3.78). Although vaccination had a significant (albeit modest) protective effect, it was omitted from the model because its addition did not significantly change the coefficients of the final model and V710-vaccine development has been discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. The final prediction model had moderate discriminative accuracy (AUC-value, 0.72). Conclusion Pre-operative S. aureus colonization status, diabetes mellitus, BMI, and type of surgical procedure moderately predicted the risk of S. aureus SSI and/or bacteremia among patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2791739470,"Aims Atherosclerosis is a well-known cause of cardiovascular disease and is associated with a variety of inflammatory reactions. However, an adequate large-animal model of advanced plaques to investigate the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis is lacking. Therefore, we developed and assessed a swine model of advanced atherosclerotic plaques with macrophage polarization. Methods Mini-pigs were fed a 2% high-cholesterol diet for 7 weeks followed by withdrawal periods of 4 weeks. Endothelial denudation was performed using a balloon catheter on 32 coronary and femoral arteries of 8 mini-pigs. Inflammatory proteins (high-mobility group box 1 [HMGB1] or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were injected via a micro-infusion catheter into the vessel wall. All lesions were assessed with angiography and optical coherence tomography and all tissues were harvested for histological evaluation. Results Intima/plaque area was significantly higher in the HMGB1- and TNF-α-injected groups compared to the saline-injected group (p = 0.002). CD68 antibody detection and polarization of M1 macrophages significantly increased in the inflammatory protein-injected groups (p<0.001). In addition, advanced atherosclerotic plaques were observed more in the inflammatory protein-injected groups compared with the control upon histologic evaluation. Conclusion Direct injection of inflammatory proteins was associated with acceleration of atherosclerotic plaque formation with M1 macrophage polarization. Therefore, direct delivery of inflammatory proteins may induce a pro-inflammatory response, providing a possible strategy for development of an advanced atherosclerotic large-animal model in a relatively short time period."
https://openalex.org/W2790974329,"A subset of the study population from a cross-sectional study of carriership of ESBL/pAmpC-producing E. coli (ESBL-E) in the general population was followed up by five successive samples over an approximate half year period, leading to six samples in 333 persons. Fecal samples were cultured and analyzed for the presence of E. coli types as characterized by MLST, and ESBL/pAmpC genes were analysed by PCR and sequencing. The study included 255 persons who had a negative first sample, to allow observations of acquiring carriership of ESBL-E. Any individual record thus consisted of a series of snapshots of episodes of presence and absence of ESBL-E carriage. A survival model was built to estimate times to acquire or lose carriership, allowing for any combination of ESBL/pAmpC gene and E. coli MLST type. In carriers, the mean time to lose carriership was 1.1 (95% range 0.8-1.6) years. The estimated mean time to acquire carriership was 3.0 (95% range 1.6-6.3) years. Analysis of these times by ESBL/pAmpC gene found substantial variation among resistance genes both in persistence of carriership and in rates of acquiring carriership: blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-27 and blaSHV-12 were easily acquired, but blaCTX-M-1 and blaSHV-12 were also easily lost, while blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-27 and blaCMY-2 were more likely to persist. When in addition bacterial host types were included, some combinations appeared more persistent than others (blaCTX-M-1 in ST10 and ST58; blaCTX-M-14, blaCMY-2, and blaSHV-12 in ST69), or were acquired with higher frequency (blaCTX-M-14 in ST38, ST69, and ST131; blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-27 in ST131; blaSHV-12 in ST69). The relatively short duration of carriership means that when an intervention drastically reduces the exposure of humans to ESBL-E, the prevalence will be halved in 0.66 years. The observed differences between carriage rates of ESBL/pAmpC genes and E. coli strains need further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2792791362,"Background The updated national guidelines for cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modification in the UK and US expand the indications for statin therapy in primary prevention to adults with moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but many adults at high CVD risk remain untreated in both countries. We set out to identify treatment gaps in English and American adults at moderate and high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to estimate the number of CVD events that would be prevented from expanding statin therapy to those who are currently untreated. Methods We used nationally representative samples of 10,375 English adults and 7,687 US adults aged 40–75 years and free of existing CVD from the Health Survey for England 2009–2013, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2012 in the US. We used the risk algorithms and the risk thresholds for statin therapy recommended by each country’s national guideline to categorize the survey participants into moderate-risk (≥10% to <20% 10-year risk of CVD in England and ≥7.5% to <20% risk in the US) or high-risk (≥20%risk) and simulated the number of events that would be prevented from expansion of statin therapy to those currently untreated. Results Close to half of adults at high CVD risk in England (46.0%) and the US (49.7%) were not receiving statins. Expanding statin use to 1.45 million high-risk adults in England would save 101,000 (95% CI = 81,000–120,000) CVD events in the next 10 years compared with 128,000 (103,000–154,000) CVD events that would be prevented from expanding treatment to 3.64 million untreated moderate-risk adults. In the US, expanding statin use to 5.27 million untreated high-risk adults would save 384,000 (305,000–461,000) CVD events over 10 years compared with 616,000 (493,000–738,000) CVD events that would be prevented from treating 20.29 million untreated moderate-risk adults. Conclusions In both England and the US, expanding statin therapy to untreated moderate-risk adults would prevent a comparable number of events as expanding statin use to a much smaller number of currently untreated high-risk adults. A large potential for CVD prevention remains from improving coverage of statin therapy among high-risk adults."

This study measured the body posture, muscle activation, and subjective discomfort scores of 12 male schoolchildren (age: 12.3 (range 12.1-13.0) y, height: 151.3 (range 144.2-154.6) cm, weight: 46.6 (range 43.6-49.7) kg) carrying backpacks weighing 5%, 10%, and 15% of their respective body weights (BWs) and walking for 10 min on a treadmill. For each load, three positions along the spinal column (T7, T12, and L3) were examined. Participants carrying a backpack weighing 15% of BW exhibited higher head flexion, trunk flexion, and corresponding muscle activation, and a lower lumbosacral angle compared with those carrying loads of 5% and 10% of BW. The waist received the highest discomfort scores when the backpacks were carried at the L3 position. Conversely, the discomfort rating for the neck and shoulders where the highest when the backpack was at the T7 position; this high backpack position also caused more head flexion than the other two positions. For the musculoskeletal health of children, the findings suggest that carrying a school backpack weighing 15% of BW should be avoided, and carrying at the T12 position may be recommended for schoolboys."
https://openalex.org/W2793521095,"Flip-flops may change walking gait pattern, increase muscle activity and joint loading, and predispose wearers to foot problems, despite that quantitative evidence is scarce. The purpose of this study was to examine the lower limb muscle co-contraction and joint contact force in flip-flops gait, and compare with those of barefoot and sports shoes walking. Ten healthy males were instructed to perform over-ground walking at self-selected speed under three footwear conditions: 1) barefoot, 2) sports shoes, and 3) thong-type flip-flops. Kinematic, kinetic and EMG data were collected and input to a musculoskeletal model to estimate muscle force and joint force. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to compare footwear conditions. It was hypothesized that flip-flops would induce muscle co-contraction and produce different gait kinematics and kinetics. Our results demonstrated that the musculoskeletal model estimation had a good temporal consistency with the measured EMG. Flip-flops produced significantly lower walking speed, higher ankle and subtalar joint range of motion, and higher shear ankle joint contact force than sports shoes (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between flip-flops and barefoot conditions in terms of muscle co-contraction index, joint kinematics, and joint loading of the knee and ankle complex (p > 0.05). The variance in walking speed and footwear design may be the two major factors that resulted in the comparable joint biomechanics in flip-flops and barefoot walking. From this point of view, whether flip-flops gait is potentially harmful to foot health remains unclear. Given that shod walking is more common than barefoot walking on a daily basis, sports shoes with close-toe design may be a better footwear option than flip-flops for injury prevention due to its constraint on joint motion and loading."
https://openalex.org/W2790353612,"Bovine milk intake has been associated with various disease outcomes, with modulation of the gastro-intestinal microbiome being suggested as one potential mechanism. The aim of the present study was to explore the oral microbiota in relation to variation in self-reported milk intake. Saliva and tooth biofilm microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA sequencing, PCR and cultivation in 154 Swedish adolescents, and information on diet and other lifestyle markers were obtained from a questionnaire, and dental caries from clinical examination. A replication cohort of 31,571 adults with similar information on diet intake, other lifestyle markers and caries was also studied. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) modelling separated adolescents with low milk intake (lowest tertile with <0.4 servings/day) apart from those with high intake of milk (≥3.7 servings/day) based on saliva and tooth biofilm, respectively. Taxa in several genera contributed to this separation, and milk intake was inversely associated with the caries causing Streptococcus mutans in saliva and tooth biofilm samples by sequencing, PCR and cultivation. Despite the difference in S. mutans colonization, caries prevalence did not differ between milk consumption groups in the adolescents or the adults in the replication cohort, which may reflect that a significant positive association between intake of milk and sweet products was present in both the study and replication group. It was concluded that high milk intake correlates with different oral microbiota and it is hypothesized that milk may confer similar effects in the gut. The study also illustrated that reduction of one single disease associated bacterial species, such as S. mutans by milk intake, may modulate but not prevent development of complex diseases, such as caries, due to adverse effects from other causal factors, such as sugar intake in the present study."

Phylogenetic relationships of clinid ceratomyxids based on the SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA and ITS regions were assessed additionally to the investigation of population genetic structure of Ceratomyxa cottoidii and subsequent comparison with the data known from type fish host Clinus cottoides.Seven Ceratomyxa species including previously described Ceratomyxa dehoopi and C. cottoidii were recognized in clinids. They represent a diverse group of rapidly evolving, closely related species with a remarkably high prevalence in their hosts, little host specificity and frequent concurrent infections, most probably as a result of parasite radiation after multiple speciation events triggered by limited host dispersal within restricted spaces. C. cottoidii represents the most common clinid parasite with a population structure characterized by young expanding populations in the south west and south east coast and by older populations in equilibrium on the west coast of its distribution. Parasite and fish host population structures show overlapping patterns and are very likely affected by similar oceanographic barriers possibly due to reduced host dispersal enhancing parasite community differentiation. While fish host specificity had little impact on parasite population structure, the habitat preference of the alternate invertebrate host as well as tidal water exchange may be additional crucial variables affecting the dispersal and associated population structure of C. cottoidii."

Even young human children can use causal reasoning to explain observations, make predictions, and design actions to bring about specific outcomes in the physical world. Weight is an interesting type of cause because it is an invisible property. Here, we tested preschool children with causal problem-solving tasks that assessed their understanding of weight. In an experimental setting, 2- to 5-year-old children completed three different tasks in which they had to use weight to produce physical effects—an object displacement task, a balance-scale task, and a tower-building task. The results showed that the children’s understanding of how to use object weight to produce specific object-to-object causal outcomes improved as a function of age, with 4- and 5-year-olds showing above-chance performance on all three tasks. The younger children’s performance was more variable. The pattern of results provides theoretical insights into which aspects of weight processing are particularly difficult for preschool children and why they find it difficult."

The effect of a maternal death in the related social group has multiplier effects, since it involves family dislocation, economic impact and disruption of the orphans' normal social development. Two perspectives that causes of maternal mortality were analyzed, on one hand, their relationship with social determinants and on the other, factors directly related to the health system. Evidence shows that comparing populations based on group of selected variables according to social conditions and health care access, statistically significant differences prevail according to education and marginalization levels, and access to medical care. In addition, the Age-Period-Cohort model raised, shows significant progress in terms of a downward trend in maternal mortality in a generational level. Those women born before 1980 had a greater probability of maternal death in relation to recent generations, which is a reflection of the improvement in social determinants and in the Health System. The age effect shows a problem in maternal mortality in women under 15 years old, so teen pregnancy is a priority in health and must be addressed in short term. There is no clear evidence of a period effect."

Generally, Tibetan chickens exhibited analogous methylation patterns to that of lowland chickens. A total of 3.92% of genomic cytosines were methylcytosines and 51.22% of cytosines in CG contexts were methylated, which was less than those in lowland chicken (55.69%). Moreover, the base adjacent to the methylcytosines of mCHGs in Tibetan chickens had a preference for T, which was different from that in lowland chickens. In Tibetan chickens, the methylation levels in the promoter were relatively low, while the gene body was also maintained in a hypomethylated state. DNA methylation levels in regions upstream of the transcription start site of genes were negatively correlated with the level of gene expression, and DNA methylation of gene body regions was also negatively related to gene expression.We generated the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in Tibetan chickens and our results will be helpful for future epigenetic studies related to adaptations to high-altitude conditions."

In addition, unknown mechanisms facilitating DNA methylation–mediated gene silencing may exist. Therefore, identification of novel compounds that can derepress certain genes repressed by DNA methylation, without directly inhibiting DNMTs and HDACs, are of research interest. Herein, we developed a cell-based screening system and screened against a chemical library containing ∼300,000 small molecules. We identified several classes of small molecules that could derepress various sets of genes repressed by DNA methylation. One group of these small molecules targets the p38 MAPK pathway and can activate endogenous MAPK target genes repressed by DNA methylation without directly inhibiting DNMTs and HDACs. To identify novel small molecules targeting gene repression, we devised a cell-based high-throughput screening system. To generate the reporter cell line, we first constructed a plasmid containing an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter that was driven by a CMV promoter. We then methylated it in vitro with SssI methyltransferase and co-transfected it into HEK293 cells, together with a construct containing a hygromycin B-resistant gene (Fig. S1). After hygromycin B selection, a stable cell line, termed B2-17, was chosen for screening. B2-17 cells displayed a low background EGFP signal (Fig. 1A) and were highly methylated at the CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). Treatment with 5 μm 5-aza-dC resulted in robust EGFP reactivation, and treatment with 100 nm trichostatin A (TSA), a potent HDAC inhibitor, also reactivated the reporter gene, albeit to a lesser extent than 5-aza-dC treatment (Fig. 1A). Using the B2-17 cell line, we performed an image-based compound screening using a chemical library containing 308,251 small molecules (Fig. 1C). This library had no specific focus and was a collection purposed for unbiased compound screening, which had been used in a variety of studies (32Sun L. Wang H. Wang Z. He S. Chen S. Liao D. Wang L.

The cells were treated with 10 μm aliquots of each compound for 72 h before imaging, and the mean percentage of EGFP+ cells (RGFP) was calculated for each compound. In summary, 1,597 compounds (0.5%) reactivated the EGFP reporter in at least 15% of cells, and 363 compounds (0.12%) reactivated the EGFP reporter in >50% of cells (Fig. 2A). We chose these 363 compounds as the primary hits and then evaluated them with two additional reporter cell lines, C3-2 (with a methylated CMV-EGFP) and 5C46-11 (with a methylated CMV-RFP), which were established using similar protocols (Figs. S1 and S2). One hundred eighty-five compounds reactivated reporter genes in >50% of cells in all three cell lines, and these were selected as the secondary hits. Next, we performed titration experiments for all of the secondary hits in the B2-17 cell line. The efficacy of each compound was evaluated by its maximal RGFP value (Fig. 2B) and relative half-maximal effect concentration (EC50) (Fig. 2C). In parallel, we also analyzed the toxicity of each secondary hit by measuring the number of viable cells in each treatment, based on quantitation of ATP, an indicator of metabolically active cells. For each compound, we calculated the relative half-maximal growth-inhibitory concentration (IC50), based on the above-mentioned assay (Fig. 2C). After these measurements, we decided to focus on seven hit compounds that met the following three criteria: maximal RGFP > 60% (good response rate) (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3A), EC50 < 5 μm (good efficacy) (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3B), and IC50 > 3 μm (less toxic) (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3C). We termed these seven compounds LX-1 to LX-7 for simplicity (Fig. 2D). Notably, the molecular formulae of the seven hit compounds were distinct from each other and did not resemble known compounds that target epigenetic regulators. To understand whether these hit compounds directly target DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylases, we examined the levels of DNA methylation and bulk histone acetylation. UHPLC-MRM MS/MS results showed that no significant changes in bulk 5mC level were observed in C3-2 cells treated with any of these compounds (72-h treatment), whereas 5-aza-dC treatment clearly reduced the bulk 5mC level (Fig. 3A). We also tested whether these hit compounds caused site-specific DNA demethylation at the reporter gene. Bisulfite sequencing results of the CMV promoter of the integrated reporter gene revealed that the changes in DNA methylation level after treatment with TSA or the hit compounds were relatively modest, whereas the effect of 5-aza-dC treatment was apparent (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that none of the hit compounds directly targeted the DNA methylation machinery. We then examined the bulk histone acetylation level of cells treated with these hit compounds. The positive controls, sodium butyrate and TSA, caused a robust global increase in histone H4 acetylation. However, none of the seven hit compounds was able to do so (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that none of the hit compounds were pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors. We next tested whether these hit compounds could activate endogenous genes. First, to focus on genes silenced by DNA methylation, we performed MeDIP-seq (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) experiments in B2-17 cells and selected a list of genes with a high level of DNA methylation at promoters or CpG islands, including TNF, EGR1, LY6K, and ISG20 (Fig. S4). Among these, TNF (36Pieper H.C. Evert B.O. Kaut O. Riederer P.F. Waha A. Wüllner U. Different methylation of the TNF-α promoter in cortex and substantia nigra: implications for selective neuronal vulnerability.Neurobiol.

Park J.H. The regulatory mechanism of the LY6K gene expression in human breast cancer cells.J. Biol.

These genes could be activated by 5-aza-dC treatment (Fig. 4A). Treatment with compounds LX-1, LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 effectively activated the expression of all of the above selected genes. Compounds LX-2 and LX-6 activated a portion of these genes with less efficiency, and compound LX-7 selectively activated the expression of TNF and ISG20 (Fig. 4A). These results suggested that some of the above compounds probably have different targets. To further study the roles of these hit compounds in regulating gene expression, we performed RNA-seq experiments using B2-17 cells treated with these seven compounds, 5-aza-dC, or RG108, another inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (39Brueckner B. Garcia Boy R. Siedlecki P. Musch T. Kliem H.C. Zielenkiewicz P. Suhai S. Wiessler M. Lyko F. Epigenetic reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by a novel small-molecule inhibitor of human DNA methyltransferases.Cancer Res. 2005; 65 (16024632): 6305-631110.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Genes up- or down-regulated >2-fold upon compound treatment, compared with DMSO-treated control samples, were defined as up- or down-regulated genes for each compound treatment. Several compounds displayed a clear effect on gene activation because treatments with these compounds resulted in far more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes. These compounds include LX-1 (981 up versus 406 down), LX-3 (1,223 up versus 364 down), LX-4 (1,064 up versus 422 down), LX-5 (1,492 up versus 460 down), and LX-6 (209 up versus 39 down) (Fig. 4B). A similar biased effect was much less apparent for compounds LX-2 and LX-7 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that these two compounds were unlikely to play direct roles in gene activation. We then performed unsupervised clustering analysis and noticed that hit compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 appeared to be closely related (Fig. 4C). Indeed, the majority of genes up-regulated by compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 overlapped with each other (Fig. 4D), although these three compounds have distinct molecular structures (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that these three compounds may function in the same pathway, and we decided to focus our study on them. To understand what kind of biological processes and pathways were targeted by compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the 795 genes that were commonly up-regulated by treatments with compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5. The clustering map of GO terms and the corresponding gene sets showed two major categories. One of these was related to secreted proteins and membrane proteins, and the other was related to the viral infection response (Fig. 5A). Consistently, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis also revealed the enrichment of several signaling pathways and immune-related processes, including the MAPK pathway and the closely related TNF pathway (Fig. 5B). In general, MAPKs are categorized into four subgroups: 1) extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), 2) c-Jun N-terminal or stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK), 3) ERK5/big MAPK 1 (BMK1), and 4) the p38 group of protein kinases (40Ono K. Han J. The p38 signal transduction pathway activation and function.Cell. Signal. 2000; 12 (10676842): 1-1310.1016/S0898-6568(99)00071-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Among these, ERKs, JNK/SAPK, and p38 kinase constitute the main network (Fig. S5). To further examine the relationship between the MAPK pathway and treatment with compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to compare the >795 genes that were commonly up-regulated by treatment with compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 with published gene sets that were regulated by TNF signaling (41Phong M.S. Van Horn R.D. Li S. Tucker-Kellogg G. Surana U.

Biol. 2010; 30 (20516219): 3816-382610.1128/MCB.00949-09Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (MSigDB set M2496), the ERK1/2 cascade (genes annotated under GO:0070372, MSigDB set M12990), and JNK knockdown (42Gazel A. Banno T. Walsh R. Blumenberg M. Inhibition of JNK promotes differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes.J. Biol.

The gene set responsive to TNF signaling was significantly enriched, and the gene set responsive to the ERK1/2 cascade was also enriched (Fig. 5C). These data also suggest that compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 may affect the MAPK pathway. MAPK pathway activation regulates gene expression through its downstream transcription factors, and many of these are also up-regulated upon MAPK pathway activation (43Pearson G. Robinson F.

We focused on transcription factors that were up-regulated upon treatment, and we identified 21 such transcription factors whose binding sites were enriched around the transcription start sites (TSSs) (TSS ± 2 kb) of the 795 genes commonly up-regulated by compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 (Fig. 5D). Notably, these factors included several oncogenic factors, including JUN, JUND, FOS, and FOSB. We next analyzed these 21 transcription factors with the STRING database, which contains known and predicted protein-protein interactions, including physical and functional associations (46Szklarczyk D. Morris J.H. Cook H. Kuhn M. Wyder S. Simonovic M. Santos A. Doncheva N.T. Roth A. Bork P. Jensen L.J. von Mering C. The STRING database in 2017: quality-controlled protein–protein association networks, made broadly accessible.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (27924014): D362-D36810.1093/nar/gkw937Crossref PubMed Scopus (4325) Google Scholar). STRING analysis of these 21 transcription factors identified a functionally linked network with high confidence (>0.7), which contained several proteins related to the MAPK pathway (FOS, FOSB, FOSL1, FOSL2, JUNB, JUN, JUND, BCL3, and EGR1) and centered on JUN, JUNB, and FOS (Fig. 5E). This network probably serves as a core regulatory module for the gene activation role of compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5. Taken together, the above analyses suggest that the activation effects of compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 are probably via the activation of the MAPK pathway and its downstream transcription factors. To further study the mechanism of gene activation mediated by treatment with compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5, we examined whether activation of ERKs, JNK/SAPK, and p38 occurred upon treatment with these compounds. In human HEK293 cells, human acute myeloid leukemia cell line MOLM13, and mouse NIH 3T3 cells, treatments with compounds LX-3, LX-4, and LX-5 induced phosphorylation of p38, but these treatments did not cause apparent increases in phosphorylation of ERKs or JNKs (Fig. 6A and Fig. S6). In control experiments, anisomycin treatment induced activation of both"
https://openalex.org/W2791244870,"Rationale Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing in utero may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis. Results Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism. Conclusion ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism."
https://openalex.org/W2793845333,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) comprises a group of uncommon disorders that present with marked proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, progressive renal failure and characteristic glomerular lesions on histopathology. The current standard of care for patients with FSGS include immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids followed by calcineurin inhibitors, if needed for intolerance or inadequate response to glucocorticoids. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) blockers are also used to control proteinuria, an important signature of FSGS. Existing treatments, however, achieved only limited success. Despite best care, treatment failure is common and FSGS is causal in a significant proportion of end stage renal disease. Thus, an unmet need exists for novel disease modifying treatments for FSGS. We employed two widely-used murine models of FSGS to test the hypothesis that systemic inhibition of chemokine receptor CCR2 would have therapeutic benefit. Here we report that administration CCX872, a potent and selective small molecule antagonist of CCR2, achieved rapid and sustained attenuation of renal damage as determined by urine albumin excretion and improved histopathological outcome. Therapeutic benefit was present when CCX872 was used as a single therapy, and moreover, the combination of CCX872 and RAAS blockade was statistically more effective than RAAS blockade alone. In addition, the combination of CCR2 and RAAS blockade was equally as effective as endothelin receptor inhibition. We conclude that specific inhibition of CCR2 is effective in the Adriamycin-induced and 5/6 nephrectomy murine models of FSGS, and thus holds promise as a mechanistically distinct therapeutic addition to the treatment of human FSGS."

Here we explore the capacity of creative language to transport complex multisensory information in a controlled experiment, where our participants improvised onomatopoeias from noisy moving objects in audio, visual and audiovisual formats. We found that consonants communicate movement types (slide, hit or ring) mainly through the manner of articulation in the vocal tract. Vowels communicate shapes in visual stimuli (spiky or rounded) and sound frequencies in auditory stimuli through the configuration of the lips and tongue. A machine learning model was trained to classify movement types and used to validate generalizations of our results across formats. We implemented the classifier with a list of cross-linguistic onomatopoeias simple actions were correctly classified, while different aspects were selected to build onomatopoeias of complex actions. These results show how the different aspects of complex sensory information are coded and how they interact in the creation of novel onomatopoeias."

The results of the analysis support the second hypothesis by demonstrating that the Byzantine Negev pigeons were like wild pigeon (Columba livia) in shape, albeit small-sized. The inferred extensive management system is then discussed in the context of pigeon domestication and human micro-ecologies in marginal regions."
https://openalex.org/W2794040761,"Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) could be a good short term option to help achieve global targets regarding road transport greenhouse gas emissions. Several common and country-specific public policies based on price or tax rebates are established in order to encourage the adoption of HEVs. The present research empirically assesses market preferences for HEVs in Spain, looking at the role of subsidies. An interactive internet-based survey was conducted in a representative sample (N = 1,200) of Spanish drivers. Drivers are willing to pay an extra amount of €1,645 for a HEV model compared to a conventional vehicle, premium which is well below the price markup for these cars. Therefore, current levels of economic subsidies applied in isolation to promote these types of vehicles may have a quite limited effect in extending their use. Overall, it is found that drivers have clear misconceptions about HEVs, which affect their purchasing choices and perceptions. Therefore, a policy mix of various incentives (including informational campaigns) may be required in order to stimulate the demand for HEVs."
https://openalex.org/W2789905519,"Operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR, China) imposes a new water fluctuation regime, including a prolonged winter submergence in contrast to the natural short summer flooding of the rivers. The contrasting water temperature regimes may remarkably affect the survival of submerged plants in the TGR. Plant survival in such prolonged flooding might depend on the carbohydrate status of the plants. Therefore, we investigated the effects of water temperature on survival and carbohydrate status in a flood-tolerant plant species and predicted that both survival and carbohydrate status would be improved by lower water temperatures.A growth chamber experiment with controlled water temperature were performed with the flood-tolerant species Arundinella anomala from the TGR region. The plants were submerged (80 cm deep water above soil surface) with a constant water temperature at 30°C, 20°C or 10°C. The water temperature effects on survival, plant biomass and carbohydrate content (glucose, fructose and sucrose and starch) in the viable and dead tissues were investigated.The results showed that the survival percentage of A.anomala plants was greatly dependent on water temperature. The two-month submergence survival percentage was 100% at 10°C, 40% at 20°C and 0% at 30°C. Decreasing the water temperature led to both later leaf death and slower biomass loss. Temperature decrease also induced less reduction in glucose, fructose and sucrose in the roots and leaves (before decay, p < 0.05), but only marginally significant in the stems (p < 0.05). However, the starch content level did not differ significantly between the water temperature treatments (p > 0.05). Different water temperatures did not alter the carbon pool size in the stems, leaves and whole plants (p > 0.05), but a clear difference was found in the roots (p < 0.05), with a larger pool size at a lower temperature.We concluded that (1) A. anomala is characterized by high flooding tolerance and sustained capability to mobilize carbohydrate pool. (2) The survival percentage and carbohydrate status of submerged A. anomala plants were remarkably improved by lower water temperatures. The survival of submergence seemed to be closely associated with the sugar content and carbohydrate pool size of the roots, which contained the lowest amount of carbohydrates. Three Gorges reservoir impoundment in winter is beneficial to the survival of submerged A. anomala in riparian area of the reservoir due to the low water temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2790454230,"Artificial selection has been demonstrated to have a rapid and significant effect on the phenotype and genome of an organism. However, most previous studies on artificial selection have focused solely on genomic sequences modified by artificial selection or genomic sequences associated with a specific trait. In this study, we generated whole genome sequencing data of 126 cattle under artificial selection, and 24,973,862 single nucleotide variants to investigate the relationship among artificial selection, genomic sequences and trait. Using runs of homozygosity detected by the variants, we showed increase of inbreeding for decades, and at the same time demonstrated a little influence of recent inbreeding on body weight. Also, we could identify ~0.2 Mb runs of homozygosity segment which may be created by recent artificial selection. This approach may aid in development of genetic markers directly influenced by artificial selection, and provide insight into the process of artificial selection."
https://openalex.org/W2791261928,"Polar seabirds adopt different over-wintering strategies to survive and build condition during the critical winter period. Penguin species either reside at the colony during the winter months or migrate long distances. Tracking studies and survey methods have revealed differences in winter migration routes among penguin species and colonies, dependent on both biotic and abiotic factors present. However, scan sampling methods are rarely used to reveal non-breeding behaviors during winter and little is known about presence at the colony site over this period. Here we show that Adélie penguins on the Yalour Islands in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) are present year-round at the colony and undergo a mid-winter peak in abundance during winter. We found a negative relationship between daylight hours and penguin abundance when either open water or compact ice conditions were present, suggesting that penguins return to the breeding colony when visibility is lowest for at-sea foraging and when either extreme low or high levels of sea ice exist offshore. In contrast, Adélie penguins breeding in East Antarctica were not observed at the colonies during winter, suggesting that Adélie penguins undergo differential winter strategies in the marginal ice zone on the WAP compared to those in East Antarctica. These results demonstrate that cameras can successfully monitor wildlife year-round in areas that are largely inaccessible during winter."
https://openalex.org/W2791987522,"Chronic handicap in early life may have a long-term impact on children’s psychosocial well-being. Here, we investigated whether Brachialis Plexus Birth Injury (BPBI)—an unpredictable injury at birth—is associated with worse mental health later on, as indicated by prescription and use of psychotropic drugs in adolescence. We explored further whether this association is different depending on socioeconomic characteristics of the child’s family, as well as sex. Of the 641 151 children born to native parents in Sweden 1987–1993 (alive and still living in Sweden at the end of 2008), identified in the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, 1587 had suffered a BPBI. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of socioeconomic characteristics and associations with later psychosocial health. Results show that beyond the known increased risks for females as compared to males, BPBI, but also lower family income, further increased the risk of burdened mental health requiring psychotropic drug use in adolescence. The effects were additive. Thus, compared to unaffected peers, teenagers who suffered a BPBI at birth are at higher risk of suffering poor mental health during adolescence, independently of surgical intervention and its outcome. Girls growing up in families with lower socioeconomic status have this risk added to their already increased risk of poor mental health during adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2790385009,"In this paper we explored the effects of exposure to images of the suffering and vulnerability of others on altruistic, trust-based, and reciprocated incentivized economic decisions, accounting for differences in participants' dispositional empathy and reported in-group trust for their recipient(s). This was done using a pictorial priming task, framed as a memory test, and a triadic economic game design. Using the largest experimental sample to date to explore this issue, our integrated analysis of two online experiments (total N = 519), found statistically consistent evidence that exposure to images of suffering and vulnerability (vs. neutral images) increased altruistic in-group giving as measured by the ""triple dictator game"", and that the manipulation was significantly more effective in those who reported lower trust for their recipients. The experimental manipulation also significantly increased altruistic giving in the standard ""dictator game"" and trust-based giving in the ""investment game"", but only in those who were lower in in-group trust and also high in affective or cognitive empathy. Complementary qualitative evidence revealed the strongest motivations associated with increased giving in the experimental condition were greater assumed reciprocation and a lower aversion to risk. However, no consistent effects of the experimental manipulation on participants' reciprocated decisions were observed. These findings suggest that, as well as altruistic decision-making in the ""triple dictator game"", collaboratively witnessing the suffering of others may heighten trust-based in-group giving in the ""investment game"" for some people, but the effects are heterogeneous and sensitive to context."
https://openalex.org/W2790987700,"The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for measuring self-care performance (the CAT-SC) in children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged from 6 months to 12 years in a content-inclusive, precise, and efficient fashion.The study was divided into 3 phases: (1) item bank development, (2) item testing, and (3) a simulation study to determine the stopping rules for the administration of the CAT-SC. A total of 215 caregivers of children with DD were interviewed with the 73-item CAT-SC item bank. An item response theory model was adopted for examining the construct validity to estimate item parameters after investigation of the unidimensionality, equality of slope parameters, item fitness, and differential item functioning (DIF). In the last phase, the reliability and concurrent validity of the CAT-SC were evaluated.The final CAT-SC item bank contained 56 items. The stopping rules suggested were (a) reliability coefficient greater than 0.9 or (b) 14 items administered. The results of simulation also showed that 85% of the estimated self-care performance scores would reach a reliability higher than 0.9 with a mean test length of 8.5 items, and the mean reliability for the rest was 0.86. Administering the CAT-SC could reduce the number of items administered by 75% to 84%. In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson r = 0.98).The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank. Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings."
