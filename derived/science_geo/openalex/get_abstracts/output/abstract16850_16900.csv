https://openalex.org/W2021263701,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) binds with high affinity to the type II receptor, a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain. We show that the type II receptor requires both its kinase activity and association with another TGF beta-binding protein, the type I receptor, to signal growth inhibition and early gene responses. Receptors I and II associate as interdependent components of a heteromeric complex: receptor I requires receptor II to bind TGF beta, and receptor II requires receptor I to signal. This mode of operation points to fundamental differences between this receptor and the protein-tyrosine kinase cytokine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1567647424,"Thioredoxin, despite its function as an intracellular disulfide reducing enzyme and its lack of a signal sequence, has been found to play some roles extracellularly. Here we show that thioredoxin is actively secreted by a variety of normal and transformed cells, including fibroblasts, airway epithelial cells, and activated B and T lymphocytes. Neither brefeldin A nor dinitrophenol, two drugs that block transport through the exocytic pathway, inhibit secretion of thioredoxin, indicating that the latter does not follow the classical ER-Golgi route. The secretory mechanism for thioredoxin shares several features with the alternative pathway described for interleukin-1 beta, such as the potentiating effect on secretion of several unrelated drugs and the sensitivity to methylamine. However, unlike interleukin-1 beta, thioredoxin is not detected in membrane-bound compartments of secreting cells. In addition, when COS7 are transfected with plasmids encoding pro-interleukin-1 beta or thioredoxin, only the latter is detectable extracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W1507472194,"A20 is an inducible zinc finger protein that confers resistance to tumor necrosis factor alpha cytotoxicity. A survey of various cell lines revealed that A20 was constitutively expressed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B-cells. Transfection experiments demonstrated that the EBV latent membrane protein LMP1 induced A20 expression. LMP1 is a transforming protein of EBV that has dramatic effects on cell growth, activation, and survival. An integral membrane phosphoprotein, LMP1 bears no homology to other recognized membrane signaling molecules, and its signal transduction pathway is not known. However, studies using the A20 promoter demonstrated that LMP1 transcriptionally activates the A20 gene through cis-acting kappa B sites. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed LMP1-inducible binding of an NF-kappa B-like factor to kappa B sequences within the A20 promoter. This is the first report implicating NF-kappa B in signaling by LMP1, a fundamentally important viral transforming protein."
https://openalex.org/W1531194664,"The nucleus is an important target of signal transduction by growth factor receptors that stimulate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. We tested the hypothesis that MAP kinases have a signaling role within the nucleus by examining the effect of the expression of a human MAP kinase isoform (p41mapk) in tissue culture cells. The expressed p41mapk was found to be localized in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the cells. Significantly, the expression of p41mapk caused an increase in the phosphorylation of a nuclear substrate: Ser62 of c-Myc. Phosphorylation at Ser62 stimulated the activity of the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of c-Myc. Thus, p41mapk causes the phosphorylation and regulation of a physiologically significant nuclear target of signal transduction. These data establish that at least one MAP kinase isoform has a nuclear role during signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1518265004,"The thiol reagent, thimerosal, has been shown to cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in several cell types, and to cause Ca2+ spikes in unfertilized hamster eggs. Using single cell video-imaging we have shown that thimerosal evokes repetitive Ca2+ spikes in intact Fura-2-loaded HeLa cells that were similar in shape to those stimulated by histamine. Both thimerosal- and histamine-stimulated Ca2+ spikes occurred in the absence of extracellular (Ca2+ o), suggesting that they result from mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Whereas histamine stimulated formation of inositol phosphates, thimerosal, at concentrations that caused sustained Ca2+ spiking, inhibited basal and histamine-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates. Thimerosal-evoked Ca2+ spikes are therefore not due to the stimulated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). The effects of thimerosal on Ca2+ spiking were probably due to alkylation of thiol groups on intracellular proteins because the spiking was reversed by the thiol-reducing compound dithiothreitol, and the latency between addition of thimerosal and a rise in [Ca2+]i was greatly shortened in cells where the intracellular reduced glutathione concentration had been decreased by preincubation with DL-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine. In permeabilized cells, thimerosal caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ accumulation, which was entirely due to inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into stores because thimerosal did not affect unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux from stores preloaded with 45Ca2+. Thimerosal also caused a concentration-dependent sensitization of InsP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization: half-maximal mobilization of Ca2+ stores occurred with 161 +/- 20 nM InsP3 in control cells and with 62 +/- 5 nM InsP3 after treatment with 10 microM thimerosal. We conclude that thimerosal can mimic the effects of histamine on intracellular Ca2+ spiking without stimulating the formation of InsP3 and, in light of our results with permeabilized cells, suggest that thimerosal stimulates spiking by sensitizing cells to basal InsP3 levels."
https://openalex.org/W1496680932,"The muscle isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase is potently activated by the allosteric ligand AMP, whereas the liver isozyme is not. In this study we have investigated the metabolic impact of expression of muscle phosphorylase in liver cells. To this end, we constructed a replication-defective, recombinant adenovirus containing the muscle glycogen phosphorylase cDNA (termed AdCMV-MGP) and used this system to infect hepatocytes in culture. AMP-activatable glycogen phosphorylase activity was increased 46-fold 6 days after infection of primary liver cells with AdCMV-MGP. Despite large increases in phosphorylase activity, glycogen levels were only slightly reduced in AdCMV-MGP-infected liver cells compared to uninfected cells or cells infected with wild-type adenovirus. The lack of correlation of phosphorylase activity and glycogen content suggests that the liver cell environment can inhibit the muscle phosphorylase isozyme. This inhibition can be overcome, however, by addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which increases AMP levels by 30-fold and causes a much larger decrease in glycogen levels in AdCMV-MGP-infected cells than in uninfected or wild-type adenovirus-infected controls. CCCP treatment also caused a preferential decrease in glycogen content relative to glucagon treatment in AdCMV-MGP-infected hepatocytes (74% versus 11%, respectively), even though the two drugs caused equal increases in phosphorylase a activity. Introduction of muscle phosphorylase into hepatocytes therefore confers a capacity for glycogenolytic response to effectors that is not provided by the endogenous liver phosphorylase isozyme. The remarkable efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer into primary hepatocytes and the demonstration of altered regulation of glycogen metabolism as a consequence of expression of a non-cognate phosphorylase isozyme may have implications for gene therapy of glycogen storage diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1607971762,"Whether calcium is the only major intracellular activator of calpain has not yet been established. Here we demonstrate that polyphosphoinositides may play critical roles in the activation process of mu-calpain. Experiments with purified enzyme, substrate (fodrin), and phospholipids show that only polyphosphoinositides but not other lipids significantly promote calpain action in the physiological intracellular calcium range of 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. The effect of polyphosphoinositide is exerted through both a reduction in the calcium concentration required for calpain autolysis and an increase in the Vmax of the proteolytic reaction. Neomycin, a polyphosphoinositide-binding antibiotic, inhibits both polyphosphoinositide-assisted proteolysis in test tubes and calcium-induced calpain activation coupled with substrate proteolysis in intact cells. This implies that the presence of polyphosphoinositides may actually be a prerequisite for calpain activation inside cells."
https://openalex.org/W1480533478,"Heparin lyase I has been purified from Flavobacterium heparinum and has been partially characterized (Yang, V. C., Linhardt, R. J., Berstein, H., Cooney, C. L., and Langer, R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1849-1857). There has been no report of the purification of the other polysaccharide lyases from this organism. Although all three of these heparin/heparan sulfate lyases are widely used, with the exception of heparin lyase I, there is no information on their purity or their physical and kinetic characteristics. The absence of pure heparin lyases and a lack of understanding of the optimal catalytic conditions and substrate specificity has stood in the way of the use of these enzymes as reagents for the specific depolymerization of heparin and heparan sulfate into oligosaccharides for structure and activity studies. This paper describes a single, reproducible scheme to simultaneously purify all three of the heparin lyases from F. heparinum to apparent homogeneity. Heparin lyase I (heparinase, EC 4.2.2.7), heparin lyase II (no EC number), and heparin lyase III (heparitinase, EC 4.2.2.8) have molecular weights (by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and isoelectric points (by isoelectric focusing) of M(r) 42,800, pI 9.1-9.2, M(r) 84,100, pI 8.9-9.1, M(r) 70,800, pI 9.9-10.1, respectively. Their amino acid analyses and peptide maps demonstrate that while these proteins are different gene products they are closely related. The kinetic properties of the heparin lyases have been determined as well as the conditions to optimize their activity and stability. These data should improve the application of these important enzymes in the study of heparin and heparan sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W2093736722,"We find that expression of the membrane dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) enhances presentation of certain endogenously synthesized peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. ACE appears to function only in an intracellular secretory compartment of antigen-presenting cells. ACE-enhanced antigen presentation requires the expression of the putative antigenic peptide transporters, TAP1 and TAP2. These findings demonstrate that a protease can influence the processing of endogenously synthesized antigens and strongly suggest that longer peptides can be transported from the cytosol to a secretory compartment where trimming of antigenic peptides to the lengths preferred by MHC class I molecules can occur if the appropriate protease is present."
https://openalex.org/W2056257769,"torso encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (torso) required for anterior and posterior terminal development of the Drosophila embryo. Injecting eggs with in vitro synthesized torso mRNAs revealed that torso activation is governed by an extracellular molecule, presumably the torso ligand, produced at terminal regions of the egg during early embryogenesis. In the absence of torso, the ligand shows no apparent localization, indicating that it is diffusible and normally bound by an excess of torso receptor at the egg poles. Mutant ligand-binding torso proteins can suppress telson formation in a dominant negative manner, suggesting that the ligand is limited in amount. Analysis of torso mutations indicates that torso functions as a tyrosine kinase and that gain-of-function mutations causing ligand-independent activation are located in the extracellular domain."
https://openalex.org/W1500634278,"Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) has been shown to act as an opsonin in the phagocytosis of viruses by alveolar macrophages. To determine whether SP-A binds to viral proteins and which part of the SP-A molecule is involved in this interaction, binding studies were undertaken. SP-A was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, and its binding to herpes simplex virus type 1-infected HEp-2 cells, as a model for virus-infected cells in general, was studied using flow cytometry. The binding of SP-A to virus-infected cells was saturable, reversible, and both time- and concentration-dependent, reaching a maximal level after 30 min at an SP-A concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. An approximately 4-fold increase in binding of SP-A to infected cells over control cells was observed. Yeast mannan, a mannose homopolysaccharide, did not influence the binding. However, heparin inhibited binding of SP-A in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, heparin could also dissociate cell-bound SP-A, indicating that polyanionic oligosaccharides are involved in the binding of SP-A to virus-infected cells. Deglycosylated SP-A, obtained by digestion with N-glycosidase F, did not bind to infected cells. Heparin or deglycosylation of SP-A had no effect on the stimulation of alveolar macrophages by SP-A. It is concluded that the carbohydrate moiety of SP-A is involved in the recognition of viruses by SP-A and may play a role in the antiviral defenses of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1607924429,"Thyrotropin (TSH) and IgG preparations from patients with Graves' disease increase inositol phosphate as well as cAMP formation in Cos-7 cells transfected with rat TSH receptor cDNA. Mutation of alanine 623 in the carboxyl end of the third cytoplasmic loop of the TSH receptor, to lysine or glutamic acid, results in the loss of TSH- and Graves' IgG-stimulated inositol phosphate formation but not in stimulated cAMP formation. There is no effect of the mutations on basal or P2-purinergic receptor-mediated inositol phosphate formation. The mutations do not affect transfection efficiency or the synthesis, processing, or membrane integration of the receptor, as evidenced by the unchanged amount and composition of the TSH receptor forms on Western blots of membranes from transfected cells. The mutations increase the affinity of the TSH receptor for [125I]TSH and decrease Bmax; however, cells with an equivalently decreased Bmax as a result of transfection with lower levels of wild type receptor do not lose either TSH-induced inositol phosphate formation or cAMP signaling activity. Thus, in addition to discriminating between ligand-induced phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and cAMP signals, the mutation appears to cause an altered receptor conformation which affects ligand binding to its large extracellular domain."

https://openalex.org/W1506764244,"The cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) of retinal rods plays a central role in phototransduction. Illumination leads to its activation by a rod G-protein (Gt, transducin), thus causing a decrease in intracellular cGMP concentration, closure of plasma membrane cationic channels gated by cGMP, and development of the photoresponse. The PDE holoenzyme is an alpha beta gamma 2 tetramer. The alpha- and beta-subunits each contain one catalytic and one, or possibly two, noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites. Two identical gamma-subunits serve as protein inhibitors of the enzyme. Their inhibition is removed when they bind to Gt-GTP during PDE activation. Here we report that the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites regulate the binding of PDE alpha beta with PDE gamma and as a result determine the mechanism of PDE activation by Gt. If the noncatalytic sites are empty, Gt-GTP physically removes PDE gamma from PDE alpha beta upon activation. Alternatively, if the noncatalytic sites are occupied by cGMP, Gt-GTP releases PDE gamma inhibitory action but remains bound in a complex with the PDE heterotetramer. The kinetic parameters of activated PDE in these two cases are indistinguishable. This mechanism appears to have two implications for the physiology of photoreceptor cells. First, the tight binding of PDE gamma with PDE alpha beta when the noncatalytic sites are occupied by cGMP may be responsible for the low level of basal PDE activity observed in dark-adapted cells. Second, occupancy of the noncatalytic sites ultimately controls the rate of PDE inactivation (cf. Arshavsky, V. Yu., and Bownds, M. D. (1992) Nature 357, 416-417), for the GTPase activity that terminates PDE activity is slower when these sites are occupied and Gt stays in a complex with PDE holoenzyme. In contrast GTPase acceleration is maximal when the noncatalytic sites are empty and Gt-PDE gamma dissociates from PDE alpha beta. Because cGMP levels are known to decrease upon illumination over a concentration range corresponding to the binding constants of the noncatalytic sites, the binding might be involved in determining the lifetime of activated PDE, after a single flash and/or during dark adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1606732154,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in GH3 cell membranes. The stimulation of the phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI/PLC) activity can be blocked by incubation of GH3 membranes with polyclonal antibodies directed against a peptide derived from the C-terminal region of G alpha q and G alpha 11. Antibodies directed against the C-terminal region of other G alpha-subunits had no detectable effect. The inhibition was specific since addition of the peptide that was used to prepare the antibody completely reversed the inhibition. Further evidence for the coupling of the TRH receptor to G alpha q or G alpha 11 comes from a reconstitution experiment in which human embryonic kidney cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs corresponding to the TRH receptor, G alpha q or G alpha 11. The PIP2 hydrolysis detected with membranes from cells that over-expressed the TRH receptor alone was low, however, co-expression with the G alpha q or G alpha 11 subunits produced a synergistic stimulation of PI-PLC activity. In contrast, co-expression of these alpha-subunits with the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor induced a weak stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis. The results presented here suggest that the TRH-dependent stimulation of PI-PLC in GH3 cells is mediated through the G-protein alpha-subunits, G alpha q and/or G alpha 11."

https://openalex.org/W2033330049,"The gastric mucosa consists of the epithelium, which lines the lumen, the lamina propria, and the muscularis mucosae. The targets of drugs used to treat stomach and duodenal ulcers are thought to be the acid-secreting parietal cells of the epithelium. However, immune cells in the lamina propria are the only cells that showed detectable messenger RNAs for histamine, muscarinic, gastrin, and dopamine receptors by in situ hybridization histochemistry. None of the epithelial cells expressed any of these messenger RNAs. Thus, the targets of antiulcer drugs seem to be cells of the immune system in the gut and not parietal cells, as generally believed. This conclusion may revise the thinking about ulcer formation and may shed light on the etiology of such chronic small intestinal diseases as Crohn's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1603514812,"We purified phosphatidic acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.4) 2300-fold from porcine thymus membranes. The enzyme was solubilized with beta-octyl glucoside and Triton X-100 and fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The purification was then achieved by chromatography in the presence of Triton X-100 with Sephacryl S-300, hydroxylapatite, heparin-Sepharose, and Affi-Gel Blue. The final enzyme preparation gave a single band of M(r) = 83,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The native enzyme, on the other hand, was eluted at M(r) = 218,000 in gel filtration chromatography with Superose 12 in the presence of Triton X-100. The enzyme was judged to be specific to phosphatidic acid, since excess amounts of dicetylphosphate or lysophosphatidic acid did not inhibit the enzyme activity. In this respect, the enzyme was inhibited by 1,2-diacylglycerol but not by 1- or 2-monoacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. The enzyme required Triton X-100 or deoxycholate for its activity. Although the enzyme appeared to be an integral membrane protein, we could not detect its phospholipid dependencies. The activity was independent of Mg2+, and other cations were strongly inhibitory. The specific enzyme activity was 15 mumol/min/mg of protein when assayed using phosphatidic acid as Triton X-100 mixed micelles. The Km for the surface concentration of phosphatidic acid was 0.30 mol%. The enzyme was inhibited by sphingosine and chloropromazine, and less potently, by propranolol and NaF. The enzyme was insensitive to thio-reactive reagents like N-ethylmaleimide."
https://openalex.org/W1607595973,"Single-stranded DNA molecules containing a 15-nucleotide consensus sequence have been reported to inhibit thrombin activity. The mechanism of the inhibition was studied using a consensus 15-mer oligonucleotide and two recombinant mutant thrombins: the anion-binding exosite mutant thrombin R70E, and thrombin K154A, in which the mutation was located in a surface loop outside of the exosite. The consensus 15-mer oligonucleotide inhibited both fibrinogen-clotting and platelet-activation activities of plasma-derived thrombin, recombinant wild type thrombin, and mutant thrombin K154A in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner, whereas it did not inhibit either activity of mutant thrombin R70E. The 15-mer oligonucleotide also inhibited thrombomodulin-dependent protein C activation by plasma-derived thrombin. In competition equilibrium binding experiments, binding of 125I-labeled diisopropyl phosphoryl-thrombin to thrombomodulin was completely inhibited by the consensus 15-mer oligonucleotide with a Kd value of 2.68 +/- 0.16 nM. These results suggest that Arg-70 in the anion-binding exosite of thrombin is a key determinant for interaction with specific single-stranded DNA molecules, and that binding of single-stranded DNA molecules to the exosite prevents the interaction of thrombin with fibrinogen, the platelet thrombin receptor, and thrombomodulin."

Interaction between the GTP-bound form of rod G-protein alpha-subunit (alpha t) and PDE inhibitory gamma-subunit (P gamma) is a key event for effector enzyme activation. This interaction has been studied using P gamma labeled with the fluorescent probe, lucifer yellow vinyl sulfone, at Cys-68 (P gamma LY) and sites of interaction on alpha t and P gamma have been investigated. Addition of alpha tGTP gamma S to P gamma LY produced a 3.2-fold increase in the fluorescence of P gamma LY. The Kd for alpha tGTP gamma S.P gamma LY interaction was 36 nM. Addition of 1 microM alpha tGDP had no effect, but in the presence of A1F4-, alpha tGDP increased P gamma LY fluorescence by 85%. When P gamma LY was reconstituted with P alpha beta to form fluorescent holo-PDE, alpha tGTP gamma S increased the fluorescence of holo-PDE with a K0.5 = 0.7 microM. Also, alpha tGTP gamma S stimulated the activity of this PDE over an identical range of concentrations with a similar K0.5 (0.6 microM). alpha tGTP gamma S enhanced the fluorescence of a COOH-terminal P gamma fragment, P gamma LY-46-87, as well (Kd = 1.5 microM). We demonstrate that an alpha t peptide, alpha t-293-314, which activated PDE (Rarick, H. M., Artemyev, N. O., and Hamm, H. E. (1992) Science 256, 1031-1033), mediates PDE activation by interacting with the P gamma-46-87 region. Peptide alpha t-293-314 bound to P gamma LY (K0.5 = 1.2 microM) as well as to the carboxyl-terminal P gamma fragment, P gamma LY-46-87 (K0.5 = 1.7 microM) as measured by fluorescence increase, while other alpha t peptides had no effect. A peptide from the P gamma central region, P gamma-24-46, blocked the interaction between alpha tGTP gamma S and P gamma LY. The Kd for alpha tGTP gamma S.P gamma-24-46 interaction was 0.7 microM. On the other hand, P gamma-24-46 had no effect on alpha t-293-314 interaction with P gamma LY. Our data suggest that there are at least two distinct sites of interaction between alpha tGTP gamma S and P gamma. The interaction between alpha t-293-314 and P gamma-46-87 is important for PDE activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1531083747,"Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with a subsaturating concentration of recombinant Pasteurella multocida toxin (rPMT) markedly potentiated the production of inositol phosphates induced by bombesin, vasopressin, and endothelin but not by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (AA and BB homodimers). Similarly, the neuropeptides but not PDGF caused a shift in the dose-dependent increase in inositol phosphates induced by rPMT. The rate of accumulation of inositol phosphates induced by bombesin was increased 2-fold by rPMT treatment while that of PDGF was unaffected. rPMT treatment also enhanced bombesin-induced inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate, the direct product of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis. In contrast, treatment of cells with rPMT had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma. Depletion of protein kinase C increased rPMT-induced inositol phosphates in a manner similar to that observed for bombesin but not PDGF. Thus, rPMT selectively potentiates neuropeptide-mediated inositol phosphate production. The action of rPMT on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis persisted in streptolysin O-permeabilized cells. Addition of guanosine 5'-O-(beta-thiodiphosphate) to permeabilized cells markedly reduced rPMT-induced inositol phosphates in a time- and dose-dependent manner. rPMT also increased the sensitivity of phospholipase C for free calcium. Our results strongly suggest that the action of rPMT facilitates the coupling of G protein to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1670677674,"Isoform 4b of the human plasma membrane Ca2+ pump was expressed in COS cells and in the baculovirus system (Sf9 cells). A 105-kDa pump fragment lacking the first two transmembrane domains and the so-called transduction domain was also expressed. The expression level was 2-4 times the background in COS cells and at least 7 times in the baculovirus system. Tests on membranes from both systems showed that the expressed pump was active. The expressed pump and the 105-kDa fragment were isolated from Sf9 cell membranes by calmodulin affinity chromatography. The pump had Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity with a calmodulin stimulation factor of 3, formed a La(3+)-stabilized phosphoenzyme, and had a KM (Ca2+) in the presence of calmodulin of about 1 microM. The 105-kDa fragment, assayed by the phosphoenzyme test on COS or Sf9 cell membranes or by ATPase measurements after isolation from Sf9 cells, proved inactive. Laser confocal microscopy on Sf9 cells showed that both the pump and the 105-kDa fragment were apparently associated with the plasma membrane.

The inhibition was reversed by micromolar concentrations of the histamine H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide and was sensitive to cholera or pertussis toxin treatment. Using [3H]N alpha-MeHA as specific tracer, high affinity binding sites were demonstrated with a Bmax of 54 +/- 3 fmol/mg of protein and a KD of either 0.61 +/- 0.04 or 2.2 +/- 0.4 nM, in the absence or presence of 50 microM GTP[gamma]S, respectively. The binding sites were solubilized by Triton X-100 and prepurified by gel chromatography. They were separated from the histamine H2 receptor sites by filtration through Sepharose-famotidine and finally retained on Sepharose-thioperamide. The purified sites concentrated in one single silver-stained protein band of 70 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They specifically bound [3H]N alpha-MeHA with a KD of 1.6 +/- 0.1 nM and a Bmax of 12,000 +/- 750 pmol/mg of protein. This corresponds to a 90,225-fold purification over cell lysate and a purity degree of 84%. Binding was competitively displaced by N alpha-MeHA (IC50 = 5.8 +/- 0.7 nM), (R) alpha-MeHA (IC50 = 9 +/- 1 nM), and thioperamide (IC50 = 85 +/- 10 nM), but not by famotidine (H2 antagonist) or by mepyramine (H1 antagonist). These findings provide the first evidence for solubilization, purification, and molecular mass characterization of the histamine H3 receptor protein and for the negative coupling of this receptor phosphatidylinositol turnover through a so far unidentified G protein."
https://openalex.org/W2102384621,"Abstract A major function of human neutrophils (PMN) during inflammation is formation of oxygen radicals through activation of the respiratory burst enzyme, NADPH oxidase. Stimulus-induced production of both phosphatidic acid (PA) and diglyceride (DG) has been suggested to mediate oxidase activity; however, transductional mechanisms and cofactor requirements necessary for activation are poorly defined. We have utilized PMN permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin to elucidate the signal pathway involved in eliciting oxidase activity and to investigate whether PA or DG act as second messengers. PMN were permeabilized in cytoplasmic buffer supplemented with ATP and EGTA for 15 min before addition of NADPH and various cofactors. Oxidase activation was assessed by superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome C; PA and DG levels were measured by radiolabeled product formation or by metabolite mass formation. Both superoxide (O2-) and PA formation were initiated by 10 microM GTP gamma S; addition of cytosolic levels of calcium ions (Ca2+, 120 nM) enhanced O2- and PA formation 1.5-2 fold. DG levels showed little change during these treatments. PA formation preceded O2- production and varying GTP gamma S levels had parallel effects on O2- and PA formation. However, while PA formation and oxidase activation occurred in tandem at Ca2+ levels of < 1 microM, higher calcium enhanced PA formation but inhibited O2- production. Removal of ATP completely blocked O2- production but had little effect on PA formation; in contrast, if ATP was replaced with ATP gamma S, parallel production of PA and O2- occurred in the absence of other cofactors. Finally, while inhibition of PA production by ethanol pretreatment led to inhibition of O2- formation in PMN treated with GTP gamma S alone, in cells stimulated with a combination of GTP gamma S and Ca2+, ethanol continued to inhibit PA formation but had no effect on O2- production. Our results do not support a role for DG in the signal transduction path leading to oxidase activation and, while we show a close correlation between oxidase activation and PA production under many physiologic conditions, we also demonstrate that PA is not sufficient to induce oxidase activation and O2- formation can occur when PA production is inhibited."

Both induced and basal levels of CAT expression were severely repressed upon co-transfection of expression vectors encoding the adenoviral E1A289R or E1A243R protein. The conserved region 1 of E1A proteins was required for this activity. IL-6-CAT expression could also be induced by co-transfecting expression vectors containing cDNAs of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A or c-jun. E1A repressed transcriptional induction by these agents as well. Similar inhibition was observed when a CAT gene driven by the NF kappa B element of the IL-6 gene was used as a reporter plasmid. In a cell line stably transfected with the E1A gene, IL-1 or TNF-alpha failed to induce IL-6 mRNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out with nuclear extracts of these cells using, as probes, the NF kappa B element or the multiple regulatory element of the IL-6 gene. With either probe, additional faster migrating DNA-protein complexes were formed in the extracts of E1A-expressing cells as compared with the extracts of the corresponding control cells. Experiments with NF kappa B antibody revealed differences between the different DNA-protein complexes formed in the extract of E1A-expressing cells. These observations suggest that E1A represses IL-6 gene transcription by interfering with the formation of appropriate DNA-protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1601240528,"Abstract The interaction of netropsin, a minor groove binding drug, with T-A-T triple helix and A-T double helix was studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy and thermal denaturation. The triple helix was made by an oligonucleotide (dA)12-x-(dT)12-x-(dT)12, where x is a hexaethylene glycol chain bridged between the 3' phosphate of one strand and the 5' phosphate of the following strand. This oligonucleotide is able to fold back on itself to form a very stable triplex. Changing the conditions allows the same oligonucleotide in a duplex form with a (dT)12 dangling arm. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrates that netropsin can bind to the triple helical structure. Spectral analysis shows that the bound drug exhibits a conformation and an environment similar in double-stranded and in triple-stranded structure. However, the binding constant to the triple-stranded structure is found smaller than the binding constant to the double-stranded one. Thermal denaturation experiments demonstrate that netropsin destabilizes the triplex whereas it stabilizes the duplex."
https://openalex.org/W1508899729,"Oscillations of free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) are known to occur in many cell types during physiological cell signaling. To identify the basis for the oscillations, we measured both [Ca2+]i and extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) to follow the fate of Ca2+ during stimulation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. [Ca2+]i oscillations were initiated by either t-butyloxycarbonyl-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-Tyr-Nle-Asp-2-phenylethyl ester (CCK-J), which mobilized Ca2+ from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-insensitive pool, or low concentration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP), which mobilized Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive internal pool. Little Ca2+ efflux occurred during the oscillations triggered by CCK-J or CCK-OP in spite of a large average increase in [Ca2+]i. When internal store Ca2+ pumps were inhibited with thapsigargin (Tg) during [Ca2+]i oscillations, a rapid Ca2+ efflux occurred similar to that measured in intensely stimulated, nonoscillatory cells. Tg also stimulated 45Ca efflux from internal pools of cells stimulated with CCK-J or a low concentration of CCK-OP. Hence, a large fraction of the Ca2+ released during each spike is reincorporated by the internal store Ca2+ pumps. Surprisingly, when the increase in [Ca2+]i during stimulation of oscillations was prevented by loading the cells with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, a persistent activation of Ca2+ release and Ca2+ efflux occurred. This was reflected as a persistent increase in [Ca2+]o in cells suspended at low [Ca2+]o or persistent efflux of 45Ca from internal stores of cells maintained at high [Ca2+]o. Since agonist-stimulated Ca2+ release evidently remains activated when [Ca2+]i is highly buffered, the primary mechanism determining Ca2+ oscillations must include an inhibition of Ca2+ release by [Ca2+]i. Loading the cells with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid had no apparent effect on the levels or kinetics of IP3 formation in agonist-stimulated cells. This suggests that [Ca2+]i regulated the oscillation by inhibition of Ca2+ release independent of its possible effects on cellular levels of IP3."
https://openalex.org/W1538830561,"Abstract Thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TRH (< Glu-His-Proamide), and [N tau-Me-His]TRH (MeTRH) are present as neutral and positively charged forms at physiologic pH, and it was possible that they bind to the TRH receptor (TRH-R) as charged (protonated) species. Binding affinities of TRH and MeTRH to endogenous rat TRH-Rs and to transfected wild type mouse TRH-Rs decreased below pH 7.1. Half-maximal decreases in binding occurred at the approximate pK alpha values of these ligands. Asp to Ala mutations in extracellular loop 1, TM-4, and TM-5 did not decrease binding affinity, but an Asp to Ala mutation in TM-2 caused the affinity to decrease 8-fold. The pH dependences of binding of MeTRH, however, were similar in wild type and all mutant receptors and were consistent with the protonated form of MeTRH binding less well. Thus, the binding of TRH to its receptor does not involve ionic interactions and may be a prototype for binding of neutral peptide ligands to G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1521867551,"The gene for human cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II (CRABP-II) has been cloned. It was isolated from a human placenta genomic library and is contained within one bacteriophage clone. The gene spans 6 kilobases and consists of 4 exons. One major transcription initiation site was mapped to an A residue 137 nucleotides upstream of the ATG initiation codon. The upstream region contains a TATA box and potential AP2, Sp1, and Krox-24 binding sites, as well as a direct repeat with homology to a retinoic acid-responsive element. The CRABP-II mRNA was rapidly induced within 2-6 h in cultured human skin fibroblasts by retinoic acid, reaching a plateau after 6 h of treatment. The rapid increase of CRABP-II message was mainly due to an increased rate of transcription as determined by nuclear run-on experiments. Increased transcription could be detected as early as 1 h after addition of retinoic acid, peaked at 2 h, and returned to basal levels within 6 h. On-going protein synthesis was required for this transient increase of transcription, since the induction was blocked by cycloheximide. These data suggest that the human CRABP-II gene is transcriptionally regulated by a newly synthesized regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1513410790,"Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) regulates the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine. It is very abundant in liver cytosol and earlier studies have shown it to be present in high concentrations in the pancreas. We have previously reported that liver GNMT is allosterically inhibited by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate pentaglutamate (5-CH3-H4PteGlu5), and proposed that this represents a metabolic control mechanism which links the de novo synthesis of methyl groups to the methylating ability of the liver. We now report that pancreatic GNMT also contains bound folate in vivo. Purified pancreatic GNMT is inhibited by reduced folate polyglutamates in vitro. The KI for the synthetic (R,S)5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 is 2.4 x 10(-7) M. The natural (S) form of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu5 is tightly bound and has a Kd of 1.3 x 10(-7) M. One mole is bound per enzyme tetramer. These studies suggest that GNMT is important in the regulation of methyl group metabolism in the pancreas as well as in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1522044645,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a functionally important component of the normal human neutrophil host defense system. This enzyme possesses a dimeric structure composed of two heavy subunit (55-63 kDa)/light subunit (10-15 kDa) protomers, each of which is associated with a heme-like prosthetic group. In addition, MPO species of approximately 38 and 22 kDa have been reported by many different investigators, but their nature and mode of origin are not understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that when MPO is heated under nonreducing, denaturing conditions, these two species are produced via a novel autolytic cleavage of the heavy subunit. The 38-kDa species was isolated by fast-protein liquid chromatography and identified by sequencing as the carboxyl-terminal portion of the heavy subunit, and the cleavage was shown to occur exclusively between Met409 and Pro410. In order to further characterize this unusual cleavage reaction, the 22-kDa species was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, and the peptide corresponding to its carboxyl terminus was isolated and analyzed by sequencing and mass spectrometry. These data indicated that during cleavage of the heavy subunit, Met409 was converted to homoserine lactone. Thus, the cleavage appeared to formally resemble the cyanogen bromide-dependent cleavage of Met-X peptide bonds. Recent x-ray crystallographic data for canine MPO have indicated that Met409 is in close proximity to the heme-like prosthetic group of MPO. Our studies suggest that interaction of Met409 with this group leads to the formation of a methionyl sulfonium derivative which undergoes intramolecular rearrangement with subsequent peptide cleavage under nonreducing conditions. This derivative may be, at least in part, responsible for the unusual spectral characteristics and enzymatic properties of the enzyme. The primary structure of the 22-kDa MPO species is also reported, and direct evidence is provided for asparagine-linked oligosaccharide moieties at two of the three predicted glycosylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W2117350325,"Maitotoxin (MTX) is a water-soluble polyether, isolated from the marine dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus, that stimulates hormone release and Ca2+ influx. We have investigated the action by which MTX induces Ca2+ influx and stimulates prolactin (PRL) release from GH4C1 rat pituitary cells. PRL release elicited by MTX is abolished in a concentration-dependent manner by nimodipine, a dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonist of type L voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC), indicating that MTX-enhanced PRL release occurs via activation of type L-VDCC. As an initial approach to determine whether MTX interacts directly with VDCC, we examined whether MTX affects the binding of [3H]PN 200-110, a DHP class antagonist, in intact GH4C1 cells. MTX increased the Bmax of [3H]PN 200-110 binding to intact GH4C1 cells from 4.6 +/- 0.03 to 12.5 +/- 2.2 fmol/10(6) cells, without changing the Kd. This indicates that MTX does not bind to the DHP site, but rather suggests that MTX may have an allosteric interaction with the DHP binding site. The effect of MTX on DHP binding was largely (65%) calcium-dependent. We next examined whether MTX alters the membrane potential of GH4C1 cells using the potential sensitive fluorescent dye bisoxonol. Addition of 100 ng/ml MTX to GH4C1 cells caused a membrane depolarization within 2.5 min which reached a plateau at 5 min. The MTX-induced depolarization was not prevented by substitution of impermeant choline ions for Na+. It was similarly unaffected by K+ channel blockers or by depleting the K+ chemical concentration gradient with gramicidin, a monovalent cation pore-forming agent. By contrast, low extracellular Ca2+ totally abolished the depolarization response, and nimodipine at 100 nM substantially reduced the MTX-induced membrane depolarization. These results indicate that the predominant effect of MTX on depolarization is Ca2+ influx through L-VDCC. Taken together, our results indicate that MTX-enhanced PRL release occurs exclusively via activation of type L-VDCC in GH4C1 cells. We suggest that MTX induces an initial slow calcium conductance, possibly via an allosteric interaction with a component of the VDCC complex, which, in turn, initiates a positive feedback mechanism involving calcium-dependent membrane depolarization and voltage-dependent activation of calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1934749285,"The baculovirus-based expression system was adapted to express alpha subunits of the complete (alpha i3) and an amino-terminally truncated (alpha i3') form of Gi3 and of two complete forms of Gs (alpha s-L and alpha s-S). Subunits encoded in full length cDNAs were obtained with yields of 40-60 mg of recombinant protein/liter of cells, of which alpha i3 was between 30 and 50% soluble, but alpha s subunits were only 5-10% soluble. Only the complete alpha i3 was myristoylated. alpha i3 was purified in four steps. The purified protein bound 0.8-0.9 mol of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) per mol of protein and had one predominant contaminant which was identified as a truncated form that begins with methionine 18 instead of methionine 1. Both the full length alpha i3 and the truncated alpha i3' formed trimers with human erythrocyte beta gamma as seen by their migration in sucrose density gradients and by an increased rate of ADP ribosylation by pertussis toxin, but compared to alpha i3, alpha i3' interacted with beta gamma with a reduced affinity and dissociated upon warming. At 32 degrees C, only full length alpha i3 was ADP-ribosylated; at 4 degrees C, alpha i3 and alpha i3' were both ADP-ribosylated, with the truncated form requiring approximately 200-fold higher concentrations of beta gamma. A genetically engineered alpha i3' (alpha i3[18-354]) was also expressed in Sf9 cells. Yields, assessed as saturable GTP gamma S binding sites, were 3-5 mg per liter. Scatchard analysis showed that truncation of the amino terminus interferes with the ability of Mg2+ to promote high affinity binding of GTP gamma S. We conclude that the G protein alpha subunit amino terminus is not essential for interaction with beta gamma dimers, but rather is important in determining the affinity of the alpha subunit for both the beta gamma dimers and guanine nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W33975413,"Visual excitation in cones is thought to involve a cone-specific G protein (cone transducin) that transduces the light signal detected by the cone visual pigment into an increase in the enzymatic activity of a cGMP phosphodiesterase. In the preceding paper, we have shown that the G beta 3 isoform of G proteins is specifically localized in bovine cone photoreceptors and proposed that it might be a component of cone transducin. We reported here the purification from bovine retinal extract of a cone-specific T beta 3 gamma complex (where T is transducin), which is composed of a G beta 3 subunit and an immunochemically distinct G gamma subunit. Our purification of this complex is based on a two-stage procedure; the first stage consists of a series of column chromatographies that yield a mixture of purified T beta gamma substantially enriched in T beta 3 gamma, and the second stage involves the removal of all of the rod-specific T beta 1 gamma from the mixture using an affinity column of immobilized monoclonal antibodies directed against the rod T gamma subunit of transducin. Using this procedure, we were able to obtain sufficient amounts of T beta 1 gamma and T beta 3 gamma to begin a comparative study of their properties. We showed that T beta 3 gamma is distinguishable from T beta 1 gamma by isoelectric focusing under nondenaturing conditions. The G beta 3 polypeptide of T beta 3 gamma also migrates slightly slower than the G beta 1 polypeptide of T beta 1 gamma on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Analysis of the interactions of T beta 3 gamma with other retinal proteins indicated that it has a lower affinity for the T alpha subunit of rod transducin but appears to complex with a phosducin-like protein. The differences in the intrinsic biochemical properties of T beta 3 gamma as compared to T beta 1 gamma may partially account for the lower light sensitivity of cones."
https://openalex.org/W1947032542,"Posttranscriptional mechanisms play important roles in insulin receptor gene regulation; variability in cellular insulin receptor number and the growth arrest-mediated increases in insulin receptor mRNA are secondary to changes in insulin receptor mRNA stability. Therefore, further characterization of the pathways and kinetics of insulin receptor mRNA degradation were investigated. The insulin receptor mRNA in the insulin receptor-rich Hep G2 cells is more stable compared with the insulin receptor-sparse MCF-7 cells. Growth arrest results in a significant rise in insulin receptor mRNA in both cell lines. The increase in mRNA is caused by changes in mRNA stability. The half-life of the insulin receptor mRNA in growth-arrested cells is approximately three times that of proliferating cells. The insulin receptor gene contains four polyadenylation sites that produce four species of mRNA of 5.4, 6.9, 8.0, and 9.4 kilobases (kb). The mRNA species are not coordinately regulated. The ratio of the most abundant species (9.4/6.9) is significantly larger in growth-arrested cells compared with proliferating cells. By utilizing a specific cDNA probe for the 9.4-kb mRNA species, it was determined that the diminished 9.4/6.9 ratio in proliferating cells was caused by a more rapid rate of the 9.4-kb mRNA degradation. The kinetics of insulin receptor mRNA degradation were investigated. Insulin receptor mRNA levels were reduced to 56% of their base line within 6 h when growth-arrested cells were stimulated to proliferate; protein inhibition with cycloheximide completely inhibited the decline in insulin receptor mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1485343520,"It is known that in respiratory burst oxidase preparations engaged in O2- production, cytochrome b558, a characteristic oxidase component, is partly reduced. This result has been interpreted in terms of a mechanism in which cytochrome b558 functions as an electron-carrying component of the respiratory burst oxidase, its level of reduction reflecting a steady-state partitioning of the cytochrome between reduced and oxidized forms as it ferries electrons from NADPH to oxygen. Kinetic arguments based on this interpretation have supported the proposal that the cytochrome is reduced at a rate sufficient to account for the rate of O2- production by activated neutrophils. We have confirmed the partial reduction of cytochrome b558 in neutrophil cytoplasts and in oxidase preparations exposed to NADPH, but have found that the reduction of the cytochrome bears no apparent relation to the activity of the oxidase, and can occur when NADPH is added to neutrophil membrane preparations that are unable to manufacture O2-. We therefore conclude that the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome b558 seen in these preparations is unlikely to be a reflection of a catalysis-related steady state and that inferences drawn from such observations regarding the kinetic competence of the cytochrome may need to be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W1496383199,"The 5'-flanking DNA of the mouse RII beta subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase gene was characterized by transient transfection of RII beta-CAT constructs into mouse neuroblastoma cells (NB2a) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and by gel mobility shift and footprinting assays. The minimal promoter of the RII beta gene was composed of two adjacent functional elements. A 3'-element which supported enhanced CAT activity was located between base pairs (bp) -267/-168 from the translation initiation start site. CAT plasmids containing these RII beta sequences showed 12- and 16-fold increased CAT activity in the NB2a and CHO cells, respectively, compared to the basic CAT vector. Plasmids containing 20 additional bp 5' to the -267/-168 fragment showed 2-fold more CAT activity than the shorter fragment in NB2a cells, while CAT activity in CHO cells was nearly the same for both constructs. CAT plasmids containing only this 20-bp fragment showed 9- and 13-fold increased CAT activity in NB2a and CHO cells, respectively. The core promoter of the RII beta gene lacked classical TATA and CAT sequences, but contained 3 copies of the Sp1 core consensus sequence. Gel mobility shift assays using 32P-labeled 5'-flanking DNA containing bp -291/-49 and nuclear extracts from NB2a and CHO cells displayed several retarded bands in the gels suggesting complex formation with nuclear DNA-binding factors. Unlabeled DNA containing bp -291/-49 blocked the appearance of all retarded bands. Competition using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the Sp1 DNA-binding site effectively blocked the appearance of the two more slowly migrating bands but did not affect the major rapidly migrating bands. DNase I footprinting analysis using purified Sp1 protein confirmed that Sp1 could bind to the Sp1 sites. Methylation interference and mutational analysis showed that one of the faster migrating bands was the result of factor binding to the DNA sequence adjacent to the Sp1 sites. Additional tissue-specific nuclear-binding factor sequences were detected upstream of the core promoter. Our data suggest that the core promoter of the RII beta gene can initiate transcription from the DNA around the Sp1 sites but that there are tissue-specific nuclear factor-binding sites located distal to the Sp1 sites."
https://openalex.org/W1507833244,"A nuclear extract from Acanthamoeba castellanii which contains all of the components necessary for specific transcription of a 5 S RNA gene was separated into fractions required for specific transcription initiation and an additional fraction needed in the reconstituted system to produce the 3' end characteristic of mature 5 S RNA. The latter fraction contained a novel processing activity characterized by an exonuclease specific for highly structured RNAs, including 5 S RNA. An intact helical stem formed between the 5' and 3' ends of the 5 S RNA precursor determines the 3' nucleotide. In addition, the presence of ATP is required for specific processing. However, the possibility has not been ruled out that ATP inhibits a nonspecific ribonuclease in the extract since processing proceeds into the helical stem in its absence."
