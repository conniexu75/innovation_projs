https://openalex.org/W2058124777,"Two approaches--molecular cloning and immunochemical analysis--have identified one of the components of Alzheimer's disease amyloid deposits as the serine protease inhibitor alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. An antiserum against isolated Alzheimer amyloid deposits detected immunoreactivity in normal liver. The antiserum was then used to screen a liver cDNA expression library, yielding three related clones. DNA sequence analysis showed that these clones code for alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. Antisera against purified alpha 1-antichymotrypsin stained Alzheimer amyloid deposits, both in situ and after detergent extraction from brain. The anti-amyloid antiserum recognizes at least two distinct epitopes in alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, further supporting the presence of this protein in Alzheimer amyloid deposits. In addition to being produced in the liver and released into the serum, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin is expressed in Alzheimer brain, particularly in areas that develop amyloid lesions. Models by which alpha 1-antichymotrypsin could contribute to the development of Alzheimer amyloid deposits are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2047817815,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine that mediates the acute phase reaction. Many of the actions of IL-1 involve direct effects on the central nervous system. However, IL-1 has not previously been identified as an intrinsic component within the brain, except in glial cells. An antiserum directed against human IL-1 beta was used to stain the human brain immunohistochemically for IL-1 beta-like immunoreactive neural elements. IL-1 beta-immunoreactive fibers were found innervating the key endocrine and autonomic cell groups that control the central components of the acute phase reaction. These results indicate that IL-1 may be an intrinsic neuromodulator in central nervous system pathways that mediate various metabolic functions of the acute phase reaction, including the body temperature changes that produce the febrile response."
https://openalex.org/W1503388237,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) regulates the growth, differentiation, or function of nearly all cell types. We now report that TGF-beta 1 increases steady-state levels of its own message in six different normal and transformed cells in culture. Accumulation of TGF-beta 1 mRNA can be detected by Northern blot analysis within 3 h of addition of the peptide to cells, and enhanced message levels persist as long as TGF-beta 1 is present in the culture medium. This autoinduction is half-maximal at approximately 10 PM TGF-beta 1, and maximal stimulation corresponds to a 2-3-fold increase in transcript levels. In normal rat kidney cells, the rise in TGF-beta 1 mRNA is actinomycin D-sensitive and is accompanied by a parallel (approximately 3-fold) increase in secretion of TGF-beta 1 protein in the culture medium of treated cells, as detected by immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled 35S-labeled TGF-beta 1 using specific anti-TGF-beta 1 antibodies. Treatment of normal rat kidney cells with either epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor also results in an increase in TGF-beta 1 mRNA (2-3-fold), although epidermal growth factor and TGF-beta 1 appear to act via distinct mechanisms since their combined effects are greater than additive."

https://openalex.org/W2103788710,"Transgenic mice were constructed with a functional T cell receptor beta gene. Transcription of the introduced gene is largely confined to T cells, but low levels of transcripts are also seen in B cells and in other tissues. Serological analyses show that most, if not all, of the T lymphocytes express the transgenic beta chain on the cell surface and lack beta chains encoded by endogenous beta genes. Molecular genetic analyses of uncloned and cloned T lymphocytes demonstrate that rearrangement of endogenous beta genes is incomplete. Partial D beta 1-J beta 1 rearrangements are found preferentially, while complete VDJ rearrangements are not seen. These findings show that expression of the transgene regulates the rearrangement of endogenous beta genes. Although the alpha beta T cell receptors of the transgenic mice are homogeneous with respect to the beta chain, they are fully functional, at least in a variety of allogeneic responses."
https://openalex.org/W1987108079,"The early monocyte infiltration observed in normal wound repair and in a number of pathologic processes precedes the epithelial and connective tissue proliferative responses, suggesting that the monocyte/macrophage may be an important source of growth factors for these tissues. In culture, activated macrophages secrete growth factors active on fibroblasts, smooth muscle, endothelium, and epithelium. This report demonstrates that activated human alveolar macrophages express the gene for transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) in an inducible manner and secrete a factor into the culture medium that is functionally and immunologically identical to TGF-alpha. Two different molecular species of TGF-alpha activity (approximately 8,500-12,000 and 28,500 daltons) are identified in macrophage-conditioned medium. These observations establish the macrophage as a diploid human cell capable of synthesizing and secreting TGF-alpha. The activated macrophage therefore represents a cellular source of a mitogenic factor that is potentially important in epithelial proliferation and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2028183411,"During development in the thymus, T cells are deleted if their receptors are able to recognize self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. We show that such clonal deletion can occur because of interaction between receptors on T cells and MHC expressed on bone marrow-derived cells. In addition, development in the thymus picks out T cells to mature if their receptors will be restricted for antigen recognition in association with self MHC alleles expressed on thymus epithelial cells. This process is usually thought to involve positive selection of T cells bearing receptors with high and low affinity for MHC on thymus epithelium, and subsequent deletion of high affinity cells by interaction with bone marrow-derived cells. Our data do not fit such a model, but rather suggest that MHC molecules on thymus epithelium and bone marrow-derived cells may not be seen identically by T cell receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1990350386,"An expression vector for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was introduced into the 32D myeloid cell line, which is devoid of EGF receptors and absolutely dependent on interleukin-3 (IL-3) for its proliferation and survival. Expression of the EGF receptor conferred the ability to utilize EGF for transduction of a mitogenic signal. When the transfected cells were propagated in EGF, they exhibited a more mature myeloid phenotype than was observed under conditions of IL-3-directed growth. Moreover, exposure to EGF led to a rapid stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism, while IL-3 had no detectable effect on phosphoinositide turnover either in control or EGF receptor-transfected 32D cells. Although the transfected cells exhibited high levels of functional EGF receptors, they remained nontumorigenic. In contrast, transfection of v-erbB, an amino-terminal truncated form of the EGF receptor with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, not only abrogated the IL-3 growth factor requirement of 32D cells, but caused them to become tumorigenic in nude mice. These results show that a naive hematopoietic cell expresses all of the intracellular components of the EGF-signaling pathway necessary to evoke a mitogenic response and sustain continuous proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1526528713,"Treatment of quiescent human embryonic lung fibroblastic cells (TIG-3) with 10 nM epidermal growth factor (EGF) resulted in 4-6-fold activation of a protein kinase activity in cell extracts that phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) on serine and threonine residues in vitro. The half-maximal activation of the kinase activity occurred within 5 min after EGF treatment, and the maximal level was attained at 15 min. Casein and histone were very poor substrates for this EGF-stimulated MAP2 kinase activity. The activation of the kinase activity persisted after brief dialysis. Interestingly, the EGF-stimulated MAP2 kinase activity was sensitive to micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+; it was inhibited 50% by 0.5 microM Ca2+ and almost totally inhibited by 2 microM Ca2+. The activated MAP2 kinase activity was recovered in flow-through fractions on phosphocellulose column chromatography, while kinase activities that phosphorylate 40 S ribosomal protein S6 (S6 kinase activities) were mostly retained on the column and eluted at 0.5 M NaCl. Platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin, phorbol esters (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate), and fresh fetal calf serum also induced activation of the MAP2 kinase in the quiescent TIG-3 cells. The activated MAP2 kinase activity in cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, or fetal calf serum was almost completely inhibited by 2 microM Ca2+, like the EGF-stimulated kinase. In addition, MAP2 phosphorylated by the kinase activated by different stimuli gave very similar phosphopeptide mapping patterns. These results suggest that several growth factors, phorbol esters, and serum activate a common, Ca2+-inhibitable protein kinase which is distinct from S6 kinase in quiescent human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1562575195,"The effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) on collagen production and gene expression in cultured fibroblasts were studied. Cells were labeled with [3H]proline, and the radioactivity of collagenase-sensitive and -resistant proteins were used to calculate the rates of protein production. The net production of collagen relative to total proteins was inhibited by TNF alpha (0-1.2 nM) in a dose- and time-related manner. The specific activities of the free [3H]proline pool, which were similar in control and TNF alpha-treated cells, were used to calculate the absolute rates of protein production. The absolute rate of collagen production was decreased by 50% in the presence of 1.2 nM TNF alpha during 24-h incubations (851 +/- 104 versus 426 +/- 39 pmol/micrograms of DNA/h; p less than 0.01), whereas noncollagen protein production and the rate of procollagen secretion were unchanged. We found no evidence of cellular toxicity in cultured cells treated with TNF alpha. In addition, TNF alpha did not affect cell proliferation as determined by [6-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Most of the collagen produced by the cultured fibroblasts was type I. Using hybridization with specific DNA probes there was an approximately 50% decrease in the quantity of procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA, without changes in the quantity of alpha tubulin mRNA or the size of the transcripts, in cells incubated with TNF alpha. Interleukin-1 (2.5 ng/ml) also decreased the levels of procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA by approximately 50%. Cycloheximide (0.1 mM), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocked the inhibitory effect of both TNF alpha and interleukin-1 on procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA. Nuclear run-off assays demonstrated that TNF alpha decreased procollagen alpha 1(I) transcriptional activity by 50% and had no effects on alpha tubulin gene transcription. Thus, TNF alpha decreases collagen gene transcription, collagen mRNA levels, and collagen production in cultured fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W1486472269,"We have used the soluble covalent cross-linking agent 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDAC) to examine the capacity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to stimulate the dimerization of purified EGF receptor, of EGF receptor in membrane preparations and in intact A431 cells. The addition of EGF either to membranes from A431 cells or to EGF receptor which was purified from A431 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography caused the appearance of a cross-linked product of Mr 340,000 which was identified using EGF receptor-specific antibodies as an EGF receptor dimer. Three independent approaches including biosynthetic labeling, surface iodination, and immunoblotting experiments were utilized to follow EGF receptor dimerization in living A431 cells. These approaches provided consistent results indicating that EGF induced rapid dimerization of EGF receptor in living cells, suggesting that this process may play a role in transmembrane signalling mediated by EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1987668067,"Cells exposed to intact, noninfectious influenza virus were shown to be recognized by class I-restricted anti-influenza cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Both internal and external proteins derived from virions were processed by cells for CTL recognition. Sensitization required the inactivation of viral neuraminidase activity and could be inhibited by preventing fusion of viral and cellular membranes. These findings are important in designing vaccines to elicit CTL responses, since they demonstrate that cells can process intact, exogenous proteins for recognition by CTLs and suggest that such processing depends on introduction of exogenous proteins into the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2157651568,"A set of transgenic mouse lines carrying Ek alpha genes with promoter region deletions was created in an attempt to compartmentalize MHC class II gene expression. Fine immunohistological analyses established that one transgenic line is essentially devoid of E complex in the thymic cortex, another displays almost no E in the thymic medulla or on peripheral macrophages, and two lines display no E on greater than 98% of B cells. We have assayed these mice for immune function: E-dependent tolerance, antigen presentation, T cell priming, and antibody response. Certain of the findings are difficult to reconcile with currently popular hypotheses, e.g., tolerance induction to E molecules in the virtual absence of E complex in the thymic medulla and efficient antibody responses to E-restricted antigens when almost all B cells are E-."
https://openalex.org/W1486018834,"The major physiological role of the serine protease inhibitor alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) is to protect elastic fibers in the lung from excessive hydrolysis by neutrophil elastase. Genetic deficiency of alpha 1-AT predisposes individuals toward the development of emphysema. We have cloned and characterized a mutant alpha 1-AT gene from an individual exhibiting a total absence of immunoreactive alpha 1-AT in serum. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this allele has demonstrated a TC dinucleotide deletion within the codon for Leu318 in exon IV. This frame-shift mutation results in the generation of a premature termination codon at residue 334, which is upstream of the active inhibitory site. To determine the biochemical basis of the null phenotype, the mutant and normal genes were transferred into mouse hepatoma cells for expression analysis. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the mutant gene is expressed into a truncated protein of 45 kDa, which is retained within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The complete lack of secretion of the truncated protein is consistent with the absence of immunoreactive alpha 1-AT in the patient's serum. In addition, a G to A transition was identified in exon II of the mutant gene, changing the codon for Arg101 to His101. Finally, an A to C transversion was identified in exon V changing the codon for Glu376 to Asp376. Since the latter conservative amino acid substitution has previously been identified in the common PiM2 variant, the frame-shift mutation might have occurred on a PiM2 background chromosome. Using the birthplace of this index case, this mutant alpha 1-AT allele has been designated nullHong Kong."
https://openalex.org/W2116954627,"In the primary structure of protein kinase C, the presence of a putative metal-binding site has been suggested (Parker, P.J., Coussens, L., Totty, N., Rhee, L., Young, S., Chen, E., Stabel, S., Waterfield, M.D., and Ullrich, A. (1986) Science 233, 853-859). In the present report, we demonstrate that the most abundant intracellular heavy metal, zinc, can increase the activity of cytosolic protein kinase C. Zinc reversibly binds the enzyme to plasma membranes, and it may contribute to the calcium-induced binding as well. The intracellular heavy metal chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine prevents the phorbol ester- and antigen-induced translocation of protein kinase C. This effect can be totally reversed by the concomitant addition of Zn2+, while Fe2+ and Mn2+ are only partially counteractive. Our results suggest that zinc can activate protein kinase C and contributes to its binding to plasma membranes in T lymphocytes induced by Ca2+, phorbol ester, or antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2014279141,"The T lymphocyte antigen-receptor complex mediates antigen-specific cell activation, at least in part, through the production of inositolphospholipid-derived second messengers. Little is known about how second messenger events, typically measured within minutes of ligand binding, eventually lead to distal biologic responses such as expression of lymphokine genes. Several monoclonal antibodies directed against the receptor complex were tested for their ability to elicit transmembrane signaling in the parental Jurkat line and in a somatic mutant (J.CaM1) with a deficient receptor function. One antibody elicited substantial early Ca2+ mobilization responses in both cells but was unable to promote expression of the interleukin-2 gene in J.CaM1. In J.CaM1 there was a diminished production of phosphatidylinositol second messengers, and the elevation in intracellular free Ca2+ was transient. Thus, short-term Ca2+ mobilization does not always indicate complete signal transmission and lead to a full cellular response."
https://openalex.org/W1501242969,"Caldesmon, a major calmodulin binding protein, was found to bind smooth muscle myosin. Addition of caldesmon to smooth muscle myosin induced the formation of small aggregates of myosin in the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin, but not in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin. The binding site of myosin was studied by using caldesmon-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. Subfragment 1 was not retained by the column, while heavy meromyosin and subfragment 2 were bound to the caldesmon affinity column in the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin but not in its presence. It was therefore concluded that the binding site of caldesmon on myosin molecule was the subfragment 2 region and that binding of caldesmon to myosin was abolished in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. Cross-linking of actin and myosin mediated by caldesmon was studied. While actomyosin was completely dissociated in the presence of Mg2+-ATP, the addition of caldesmon caused aggregation of the actomyosin. By low speed centrifugation at which actomyosin alone was not precipitated in the presence of Mg2+-ATP, the aggregate induced by caldesmon was precipitated and the composition of the precipitate was found to be actin, caldesmon, and myosin. In the presence of Mg2+-ATP, pure actin did not bind to a myosin-Sepharose 4B affinity column, while all of the actin was retained when the actin/caldesmon mixture was applied to the column. These results indicate that caldesmon can cross-link actin and myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1541849094,"Mouse macrophage elastase, a metalloproteinase, catalytically inactivates human alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) by attacking a single peptide bond between Pro357 and Met358, resulting in Mr = 4,200 and 47,800 fragments. We show here that this proteolytically inactivated alpha 1-PI is a potent chemotactic factor for human neutrophils at a concentration of 1 nM. The chemotactic response is equivalent to that elicited by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Native alpha 1-PI does not stimulate chemotaxis. Purification of the two fragments of alpha 1-PI that result from proteolysis by macrophage elastase indicated that the Mr = 4,200 fragment is responsible for the chemotactic activity. However, the two proteolysis fragments do not dissociate from each other under physiologic conditions. Therefore, the ability of proteolytically inactivated alpha 1-PI to act as a mediator of inflammation is due to rearrangement of the alpha 1-PI molecule rather than to release of a cleavage fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1524473114,"The ability of the T lymphocyte growth factor interleukin 2 (IL-2) to activate a tyrosine protein kinase in vivo was assessed by using antibodies to phosphotyrosine in conjunction with immunoblots. Treatment of the murine IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T cell line CTLL-2 with IL-2 resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular weights ranging from 38,000 to 120,000. The tyrosine phosphorylation in the various proteins increased in a concomitant fashion and reached a maximum level within 15 min. The concentration of IL-2 required for inducing this phosphorylation was similar to that required for stimulating [3H]thymidine uptake, indicating that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the ability of IL-2 to stimulate the proliferation of the CTLL-2 cells. IL-2 was also found to induce the phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues in short term cultures of human T lymphocytes. These results suggest that IL-2, like other polypeptide growth factors, acts by stimulating the activity of a tyrosine protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1507759123,"Basal rates of long-lived (resident) protein degradation in rat liver, measured during perfusion after amino acid suppression of macroautophagy, were shown to be strongly regulated by caloric deprivation, decreasing 70% over 48 h in animals fed a high protein diet and 50% in normal controls. Intralysosomal pools of degradable protein correlated directly with basal turnover over this range, yielding a slope (0.09 min-1) that was virtually identical with previous estimates of macroautophagic turnover. The specific radioactivity of valine released from lysosomes in previously labeled livers was the same as that in plasma in both basal and deprivation-induced states. Quantitative electron microscopy revealed a significant decrease with starvation in the absolute volume of a class of secondary lysosome (type A) previously associated with basal or microautophagy. By contrast, the volumes of other microautophagic forms, which comprised roughly 10% of the total, did not change. Taking 0.087 min-1 as the turnover constant of degradable intralysosomal protein and assuming that the concentration of sequestered protein was the same in all vacuoles as that in cytoplasm, we obtained close agreement between predicted and observed rates of basal protein turnover over the range of regulation. The results support the view that the lysosomal system is the final step in the basal degradation of long-lived proteins in the hepatocyte and that a specific class of secondary lysosome (type A) plays a direct role in its regulation during caloric starvation."

https://openalex.org/W1493447035,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of A-431 cells induces a biphasic increase in the levels of inositol phosphates. The growth factor produces an initial, rapid increase in the level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) due to hydrolysis of phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Wahl, M., Sweatt, J. D., and Carpenter, G. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 142, 688-695). The level of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins-1,3,4,5-P4) also rises rapidly in response to treatment with EGF. The initial formation (less than 1 min) of Ins-1,4,5-P3 and Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 does not require Ca2+ present in the culture medium. However, the addition of Ca2+ to the medium at levels of 100 microM or greater potentiates the growth factor-stimulated increases in the levels of all inositol phosphates at later times after EGF addition (1-60 min). The data suggest that EGF-receptor complexes initially stimulate the enzyme phospholipase C in a manner that is independent of an influx of extracellular Ca2+. The presence of Ca2+ in the medium allows prolonged growth factor activation of phospholipase C. Treatment of A-431 cells with Ca2+ ionophores (A23187 and ionomycin) did not mimic the activity of EGF in producing a rapid increase in the formation of the Dowex column fraction containing Ins-1,4,5-P3, Ins-1,3,4,5-P4, and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (InsP3). However, the initial EGF-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates was substantially diminished in cells loaded with the Ca2+ chelator Quin 2/AM. EGF receptor occupancy studies indicated that maximal stimulation of InsP3 accumulation by EGF requires nearly full (75%) occupancy of available EGF binding sites, while half-maximal stimulation requires 25% occupancy. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an exogenous activator of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), causes a dramatic, but transient, inhibition of the EGF-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates. Tamoxifen and sphingosine, reported pharmacologic inhibitors of protein kinase C activity, potentiate the capacity of EGF to induce formation of inositol phosphates. Neither TPA nor tamoxifen significantly affects the 125I-EGF binding capacity of A-431 cells; however, TPA appeared to enhance internalization of the ligand. Ligand occupation of the EGF receptor on the A-431 cell appears to initiate a complex signaling mechanism involving production of intracellular messengers for Ca2+ mobilization and activation of protein kinase C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1533597003,"The effects of four bile acids on cell Ca2+ were examined in suspensions of isolated rat hepatocytes. Taurolithocholate and lithocholate which inhibit bile secretion increased the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (ED50, 25 microM), as measured by the fluorescent indicator quin2, and promoted a net loss of Ca2+ from the cells. This effect resulted from rapid mobilization of Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ store. This store corresponds to the one that is permeabilized by the inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate-dependent hormone vasopressin. However, taurolithocholate and lithocholate, unlike the hormone, did not induce a significant accumulation of inositol trisphosphate fraction in isolated hepatocytes. In addition, these agents did not alter the cell and the mitochondria membrane permeability to ions. When applied to saponin-permeabilized cells, taurolithocholate and lithocholate released Ca2+ (ED50, 20 microM) from an ATP-dependent, nonmitochondrial pool which is sensitive to inositol (1,4,5)trisphosphate. In contrast, the bile acids taurocholate and cholate, which increase bile secretion, had no effect on cell Ca2+ in intact hepatocytes or in saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes. It is suggested that taurolithocholate and lithocholate permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum to Ca2+ and that the resulting permeabilization of this compartment may be involved in the inhibition of bile secretion in mammalian liver."
https://openalex.org/W1570573502,"The production and metabolism of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and other inositol polyphosphates was studied in cultured bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells prelabeled for 24 h with [3H]inositol. During stimulation with angiotensin II, Ins-1,4,5-P3 increased to a peak of 15-fold above basal within 10 s, followed by a second phase of continuous increase over the next 30 min. Ins-1,4,5-P3 formed during agonist stimulation was rapidly metabolized by two distinct pathways. The more direct metabolic route was via degradation by sequential dephosphorylations to form inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and inositol 4-phosphate, and ultimately inositol. Lithium ions inhibited both the formation and dephosphorylation of inositol 4-monophosphate, which is a specific product of inositol polyphosphate metabolism. In addition, a cyclical metabolic sequence was initiated by the 3-phosphorylation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 to form inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. The Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase responsible for this reaction had a Km of 0.4 microM for Ins-1,4,5-P3 and a Vmax of 208 pmol/min/mg and was stimulated by increased Ca2+ concentrations in the micromolar range. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was then dephosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, which in turn was either further degraded to inositol 3,4-bisphosphate or rephosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate. Lithium ions also inhibited the production of inositol 3,4-bisphosphate, explaining the large accumulation of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate in cells stimulated in the presence of lithium. Prolonged exposure to angiotensin II in the presence of Li+ caused a progressive decline in inositol polyphosphate formation without depletion of the lipid precursor, phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, suggesting that an accumulating product of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis (possibly diacylglycerol) has an inhibitory effect on the phospholipase C-catalyzed breakdown process. These results indicate that, in addition to its breakdown by sequential dephosphorylations through Ins-1,4-P2 and Ins-4-P, Ins-1,4,5-P3 undergoes a complex series of phosphorylations and dephosphorylations to form at least two inositol tetrakisphosphates and their metabolites. These newly defined pathways may provide additional regulatory steps in the mechanism of cell activation by angiotensin II and other Ca2+-mobilizing hormones."

The separation of V beta and C beta observed in somatic cell hybrids defined the orientation of the T cell receptor beta chain locus on chromosome 7 where the V beta genes are centromeric and the C beta genes are telomeric. A novel chromosomal alteration, undetected cytogenetically, was revealed as being an inversion with duplication of the distal band of chromosome 14q32. The importance of the 14q32 region in the leukemogenic process is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1496978632,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha bind to a common receptor at the cell surface. Both the affinity and the tyrosine protein kinase activity of the receptor are regulated by exogenous factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor. A protein kinase C-dependent (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) and independent regulatory mechanism have been described. The protein kinase C-dependent mechanism results in the inhibition of the affinity and tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor. We describe in this report an alternative mechanism of regulation of the receptor that is mediated by sphingosine. Treatment of WI-38 human fetal lung fibroblasts with 5 microM sphingosine for 2 min at 37 degrees C caused a marked increase in the affinity of the EGF receptor. Similar results were obtained when isolated plasma membranes prepared from these cells were incubated with sphingosine. A stimulation of the EGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase activity was also observed after sphingosine-treatment of plasma membranes. Sphingosine caused a decrease in the Km for ATP and an increase in the Vmax for the tyrosine phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate. Control experiments demonstrated that these actions of sphingosine were not secondary to the inhibition of protein kinase C. These data indicate that sphingosine causes the functional conversion of the EGF receptor into an activated state that expresses both a high affinity for EGF and an increased tyrosine kinase activity. We conclude that sphingosine is a bioactive molecule in human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1539092632,"Monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) obtained from the lipopolysaccharide of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides ATCC 17023 was initially purified by silicic acid column chromatography to yield a single major pentaacyl MLA fraction. This fraction was methylated and further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography to yield three prominent peak fractions. Laser desorption mass spectrometry of these three fractions allowed us to complete the important structural analysis of lipid A from this source. Three structurally distinct forms of dimethyl MLA were identified where Mr = 1447, 1449, and 1451 atomic mass units. These forms differed only by the presence or absence of unsaturation and keto group in the fatty acids. We established that the acyloxyacyl group (either delta 7-tetradecenoyloxytetradecanoate or tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoate) and the 3-ketotetradecanoate or hydroxytetradecanoate occupied the 2'- and 2-positions of the glucosamine disaccharide, respectively. Analysis of several minor fractions suggests that there is considerable structural heterogeneity in the MLA. With this new knowledge, the study of the structure-to-function relationship of the reported lack of toxicity of lipopolysaccharide from R. sphaeroides can be completed."
https://openalex.org/W1568354597,"Acridine orange, acridine yellow G, and related compounds potently inhibited protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activity and phorbol dibutyrate binding. Inhibition was investigated in vitro using Triton X-100 mixed micellar assays (Hannun, Y. A., Loomis, C. R., and Bell, R. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10039-10043 and Hannun, Y. A., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9341-9347). Inhibition by the acridine derivatives was subject to surface dilution; therefore, the relevant concentration unit is mol % rather than the bulk molar concentration. Fifty percent inhibition of protein kinase C activity occurred at concentrations of these compounds comparable to concentrations of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS) required for enzyme activation (i.e. 1-6 mol %). The mechanism of inhibition appeared to be complex: both the catalytic and regulatory sites of protein kinase C were affected. Acridine orange was a competitive inhibitor with respect to MgATP when the catalytic fragment of protein kinase C was employed. Inhibition at the active site was overcome by the addition of Triton X-100 micelles or phospholipid vesicles. When the activity of intact protein kinase C was measured, inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to MgATP. Further kinetic analysis suggested a competitive type of inhibition with respect to PS and DAG implying an interaction of acridine compounds with the regulatory lipid cofactors or with the regulatory domain of protein kinase C. This was further supported by demonstrating inhibition of phorbol dibutyrate binding to both protein kinase C and the lipid-binding domain generated by trypsin hydrolysis. Acridine orange and acridine yellow G also inhibited thrombin-induced 40-kDa phosphorylation in human platelets and phorbol dibutyrate binding to platelets. These effects were also subject to surface dilution. These results suggest that acridine derivatives have multiple interactions with protein kinase C with the predominant effect being inhibition of activation within the regulatory domain of the enzyme. Some of the biologic effects of acridine derivatives including anti-tumor action may occur as a consequence of protein kinase C inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1512537330,"Extracellular nucleotide degradation was studied in intact human B and T lymphocyte subpopulations and in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Cells of B lymphocyte lineage showed high nucleotide degrading activity, whereas T lymphocytes were unable to degrade extracellular nucleotides. The external surface of B cells contained active sites of ecto-triphosphonucleotidase (ecto-ATPase), ecto-diphosphonucleotidase (ecto-ADPase), and ecto-monophosphonucleotidase (ecto-AMPase). The expression of all three ectoenzyme activities seemed closely associated with B cell development. ATPase and ADPase activities increase continuously during B cell maturation, ecto-AMPase activity, on the other hand, reaches maximal activity in late pre-B cells. These results combined with our previous studies of intracellular ATP catabolism (Barankiewicz, J., and Cohen, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15178-15181) provide evidence that extracellular ATP catabolism may represent exclusive source for adenosine in lymphocytes. It is suggested that adenosine may serve as a means of communication between B and T cells in lymphoid organs, B lymphocytes being the sole producers of adenosine and T lymphocytes being the recipients of this signal."
https://openalex.org/W1761725356,"Chromaffin granules take up and concentrate 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) through a temperature-sensitive and saturable mechanism. The uptake displays an apparent Km of 51.2 microM and a Vmax of 7.1 nmol/min/mg of protein. MPP+ uptake is markedly depressed in the absence of ATP or by inhibition of the membrane Mg2+-dependent ATPase, and it is completely blocked by reserpine. Reversal of the membrane potential by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or dissipation of the pH gradient in the presence of nigericin plus potassium ions produces a marked inhibition of MPP+ uptake indicating that the process is dependent upon the integrity of the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient generated and maintained by the membrane Mg2+-dependent ATPase. Furthermore, the data shows that a permanently charged compound is capable of entering the granule through the catecholamine carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1607423821,"Alkaline phosphatase activity appears to be altered when chondrocyte cultures are incubated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). This study examined whether the hormone-responsive enzyme activity is associated with alkaline phosphatase-enriched extracellular membrane organelles called matrix vesicles. Confluent, third passage cultures of rat costochondral growth cartilage (GC) or resting zone chondrocytes (RC) were incubated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 or 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3) and enzyme specific activity was assayed in the cell layer or in isolated matrix vesicle and plasma membrane fractions. Alkaline phosphatase-specific activity in the matrix vesicles was enriched at least 2-fold over that of the plasma membrane and 10-fold over that of the cell layer. Matrix vesicle alkaline phosphatase was stimulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in GC cultures and by 24,25-(OH)2D3 in RC cultures. The cell layer failed to reveal these subtle differences. 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased GC enzyme activity but the effect was one-half that observed in the matrix vesicles alone. No effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on enzyme activity of the RC cell layer or of 24,25-(OH)2D3 on either GC or RC cell layers was detected. Thus, response to the metabolites is dependent on chondrocytic differentiation and is site specific: the matrix vesicle fraction is targeted and not the cells per se."

https://openalex.org/W1522894330,"Ca2+ release triggered by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and/or GTP has been studied with rough and smooth microsomes isolated from rat liver. Microsomes were loaded with Ca2+ in the presence of MgATP and in the presence or in the absence of glucose 6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) which markedly stimulated the MgATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation in rough and smooth microsomes (5- and 10-fold, respectively). Upon addition of IP3 (5 microM), rough and smooth microsomes rapidly release a part (not exceeding 20%) of the Ca2+ previously accumulated both in the absence and in the presence of glucose-6-P. Under the same experimental conditions, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was ineffective in triggering any Ca2+ release. Upon addition of GTP (10 microM) both the microsomal fractions progressively release the Ca2+ previously accumulated in the presence of glucose-6-P, when 3% polyethylene glycol was also present. In the absence of polyethylene glycol, GTP released Ca2+ from rough microsomes only, and GTP plus IP3 caused a Ca2+ release which was the sum of the Ca2+ releases caused by GTP and IP3 independently. Both IP3 and GTP, added to microsomes at the beginning of the glucose-6-P-stimulated Ca2+ uptake, reduced the Ca2+ accumulation into rough and smooth microsomes without modifying the initial rate (3 min) of Ca2+ uptake. Also in these conditions, the effects of GTP and IP3 were merely additive. These results indicate that both rough and smooth liver microsomes are responsive to IP3 and GTP with respect to Ca2+ release and that IP3 and GTP likely act independently."
https://openalex.org/W1527255186,"Experiments were performed to determine whether EcoRI methylase catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine (a) directly to the N6 of adenine in DNA or (b) initially to N1 to give N1-methyladenine followed by isomerization of the N1-methylamino and 6-NH2 to give N6-methyladenine (Dimroth rearrangement). A facile synthesis of highly enriched [6-15N]deoxyadenosine and a dodecamer substrate of EcoRI methylase with [6-15N]adenine in the methylation site are reported. In the product of EcoRI enzymatic methylation, all of the isotope remains at the N6 position of the N6-methyladenine product. It is concluded that, contrary to existing chemical precedent, the methylation occurs by direct transfer from S-adenosylmethionine to the N6 of adenine in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1485349337,"The induction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA by recombinant murine interleukin-1, recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha, and recombinant human interleukin-1 beta has been studied in the rat hepatoma cell line Fao. Whereas the stimulatory capacities of recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha and recombinant murine interleukin-1 were almost identical, the concentrations of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta needed for half-maximal induction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA were lower by three orders of magnitude. A 60-fold increase in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA levels was observed 18 h after the addition of recombinant interleukin-1 beta. In parallel albumin mRNA levels decreased to about 30%. The alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA induction was strictly dependent on the presence of dexamethasone. For a full stimulation dexamethasone concentrations of greater than 10(-7) M were needed, whereas concentrations of less than 10(-12) M were ineffective. The increase in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA after recombinant human interleukin-1 beta was followed by a 36-fold stimulation in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein synthesis and secretion. When protein synthesis was blocked by either cycloheximide, puromycin, or emetine, the induction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA by recombinant human interleukin-1 beta was impaired suggesting the involvement of a short-lived protein in the induction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2160610387,"In this study, A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells were grown in folinic acid in contrast to folic acid, and the molecular and biochemical properties of cisplatin-resistant A2780 cells were analyzed for changes in the dTMP synthase cycle. At concentrations of folinic acid that were optimal for cell growth (10(-8) M), the ED50 for cisplatin was 2.5 and 43 microM in the A2780S and A2780DDP cells, respectively. Resistance to cisplatin was associated with a 2-fold cross-resistance to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and 5-fluorouracil as well as a 3-fold increase in both dTMP synthase activity and mRNA. The ED50 for methotrexate was similar in both A2780S and A2780DDP cells (1.2 microM). When both the A2780S and A2780DDP cells were grown in folinic acid, there was no significant difference in the level of dihydrofolate reductase activity. This data would suggest that cisplatin resistance is associated with changes in folate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1541774345,"Contraction of glycerinated porcine carotid artery smooth muscle in response to calcium (20 microM), calmodulin (10 microM), and MgATP was associated with phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain (LC20) to an average stoichiometry of 1.47 mol of PO4/mol of LC20. Tryptic and chymotryptic phosphopeptide maps of the mono- and diphosphorylated forms of LC20 purified from skinned muscles demonstrated the presence of a single phosphopeptide in all cases. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the monophosphorylated form contained primarily phosphoserine, whereas the diphosphorylated form contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Thiophosphorylation of LC20 by adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) resulted in the incorporation of 1 mol of thiophosphate into phosphoserine. Thiophosphorylated LC20 could be subsequently phosphorylated at a threonine residue to a stoichiometry of 1.7 mol of PO4/mol of LC20 by incubation in the presence of MgATP, calcium, and calmodulin. The extent of multiple site phosphorylation of LC20 was dependent upon both the ionic strength and the free Mg2+ concentration in the muscle bath; increasing either ionic strength (0.07-0.15 M) or [Mg2+] (1-20 mM) resulted in lower stoichiometries of LC20 phosphorylation. The effect of multiple site phosphorylation on contraction was examined in muscles which were seqentially phosphorylated at serine followed by threonine. Full activation (21 degrees C) of both isometric force (1.4 newtons/cm2) and unloaded shortening velocity (0.016 L0/s) was achieved following thiophosphorylation to 1.1 mol of PO4/mol of LC20. No further activation of either isometric force (1.5 newtons/cm2) or unloaded shortening velocity (0.015 L0/s) occurred following phosphorylation to 1.7 mol of PO4/mol of LC20."
https://openalex.org/W1549331588,"Abstract A cDNA clone encoding a polypeptide resembling proteolytic serine esterases (from cytotoxic T-cells; SECT) was isolated from human peripheral blood lymphocytes which had been cultured in the presence of the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin for 72 h. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 247 amino acids which show homology of 99% with the protein sequence encoded by a cDNA clone (1-3E) isolated from staphylococcal enterotoxin A-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes and 68% with the protein sequence (cytotoxic cell protease type I) derived from a cDNA clone (C11) encoding a serine esterase isolated from a murine cytotoxic T-cell line. The overall nucleotide sequence homology between the SECT cDNA and 1-3E was 99% and 73% between SECT and C11. Comparing the coding regions of SECT and C11 showed 75% homology, whereas the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions showed 67% homology. Phytohemagglutinin stimulation results in 30-, 60-, and 370-fold increases in cytoplasmic SECT mRNA with respect to unstimulated cells after 6-, 24-, and 72-h cultures, respectively. At 6 h, the increase in SECT mRNA occurs in the absence of increases in SECT gene transcription and cytoplasmic mRNA stabilization. A 5-fold increase in SECT nuclear RNA seen at this time suggests that stabilization of SECT nuclear RNA transcript is responsible for early increases in SECT mRNA levels. At 24 and 72 h, the increased cytoplasmic SECT mRNA levels can be accounted for by increased transcriptional activity of the SECT gene."
https://openalex.org/W1562015285,"The bifunctional NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase from ascites tumor cells has very different kinetic properties from the larger NADP-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase present in all mammalian cells. The NAD-dependent dehydrogenase is unique in that it requires formation of a magnesium.enzyme complex to allow addition of the first substrate, NAD+. It catalyzes an equilibrium ordered kinetic mechanism that has methylenetetrahydrofolate as the last reactant to add and NADH as the last product released. The NADP-dependent dehydrogenase has the same order of addition of substrates, but NADPH is released prior to methenyltetrahydrofolate. The dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase activities of both enzymes channel methenyltetrahydropteroylglutamate intermediates with the same efficiency which is unaffected by the number of glutamyl residues in the methylenetetrahydrofolate substrate. However, the cyclohydrolase activity of the bifunctional protein is kinetically independent of its dehydrogenase activity, as supported by its lack of inhibition by NAD+, whereas NADP+ strongly inhibits that of the NADP-dependent enzyme. This difference is further demonstrated by the observation that conversion of formyltetrahydrofolate to methylenetetrahydrofolate in the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotide is catalyzed readily only by the bifunctional enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1584792006,"The highly fluorescent probes Indo-1 and Fura-2 were employed to detect intracellular calcium responses in murine splenic lymphocytes following cross-linking of cell surface Ig. Inhibition by phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate) was rapid and showed a strong preference for the very transient phase of the response which has been identified as a mobilization of intracellular calcium. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate had significantly less effect on the longer lasting increase in intracellular free calcium which involved an influx of extracellular calcium. Whole spectra were used as a check on transients, which were monitored at a single wavelength, in order to eliminate changes that were not calcium-dependent. It was found that such changes could arise from the association of Indo-1, or its acetoxymethyl ester, with phospholipid bilayers since this affected their fluorescence spectra. In addition, the loading of resting cells with dye esters was shown to be greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a small amount of the detergent Pluronic F-127 in the incubation medium. A spectral analysis of labeled cells showed that the extent of hydrolysis of intracellular dye was improved as well as the rate of uptake by cells."

In addition to the acidic glycosphingolipids with known structures (sulfatide, GM4, GM3, GM2, and GD1a), two fractions of a major monosialosylganglioside with TLC mobility slower than GM1 were isolated and characterized as having the following structure. (Formula:q see text). The structure represents a novel combination of a terminal Forssman disaccharide (GalNAc alpha 1----3GalNAc beta 1----3R) and a GM1 ganglioside core linked together. The identity of the terminal Forssman disaccharide was further established by TLC immunostaining with an anti-Forssman monoclonal antibody. This antibody showed strongly positive staining of the ganglioside only after removal of the sialic acid. Thus, the II3NeuAc residue inhibited antibody binding to the terminal disaccharide unit. Analysis of the ceramide moieties of both fractions indicated a predominance of 16:0, 22:1, 22:0, and 24:1 fatty acids in the faster migrating form and 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 in the slower form in combination with d18:1 sphingosine."

Ionomycin induced an increase in gamma-TCR mRNA while TPA prevented this effect. The effects of ionomycin and TPA are completely reversed upon their removal. Protein kinase C-depleted cells are unable to respond to TPA but the induction of gamma-TCR by ionomycin was unimpaired. The regulation of gamma-TCR gene expression by TPA and ionomycin occurred at the level of gene transcription, whereas the rate of gamma-TCR mRNA degradation was unaffected by TPA or ionomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1510921942,"Gene 18 and 19 proteins of bacteriophage T7 are essential for DNA maturation and packaging. The phage capsid is the site of both maturation and packaging of T7 DNA. Both gene 18 and 19 proteins bind to capsid intermediates during DNA packaging but are not found in mature virions, suggesting that they play a direct role in the enzymatic mechanisms of DNA maturation and packaging. As part of an effort to reconstitute T7 DNA maturation and packaging with purified components, we have cloned and overexpressed T7 gene 19 in Escherichia coli. Gene 19 has been inserted downstream from the bacteriophage PL promoter controlled by the temperature-sensitive lambda repressor encoded by c1857. Upon thermal induction, most of the overproduced gene 19 protein is insoluble and inactive. However, by attenuation of the expression of gene 19 from the PL promoter, significant levels of soluble and active gene 19 protein are produced. Soluble gene 19 protein can be monitored by its ability to complement extracts of T7-infected cells for packaging of exogenous DNA. We have used this assay to monitor the activity of gene 19 protein during purification. The native protein is a monomer of molecular weight 66,000. We have also tested for the formation of a stable complex between gene 18 and 19 proteins. Coproduction of gene 18 and 19 proteins has no effect on either the solubility or activity of gene 19 protein, despite the fact that gene 18 protein is produced at at least 10-fold greater rates. Furthermore, we find no evidence for any interaction between soluble gene 18 and 19 proteins in extracts or between the purified proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1528197156,"Deoxyadenosine plus deoxycoformycin (dCf) causes increased DNA breaks in lymphoid cells. This study explored the possible inhibition of repair synthesis of DNA by dAdo plus dCf as a cause of DNA breakage. It was shown that DNA breaks accumulated in a human T-lymphoblast cell line, CCRF-CEM, following incubation with dAdo plus dCf and were not fully repaired 20 h after their removal. Analysis of the density distribution of radiolabeled DNA on alkaline CsCl gradient showed that incubation of CCRF-CEM cells with dAdo plus dCf caused inhibition of semiconservative, but not repair synthesis of DNA. Semiconservative synthesis of DNA was also inhibited in CCRF-CEM nuclei isolated from cells pretreated with dAdo and dCf, suggesting damage to DNA replicative machinery. However, no such inhibition was observed in the nuclei of a similarly treated CCRF-CEM mutant that was deficient in adenosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase. This suggests that dAdo must be phosphorylated in intact cells to exert its effect. Using [3H]dTTP incorporation in isolated CCRF-CEM nuclei to measure DNA synthesis, it was found that a high concentration (greater than 100 microM) of dATP inhibits semiconservative but not repair synthesis of DNA. The present studies thus indicate that accumulation of DNA strand breaks induced by dAdo plus dCf is not the consequence of inhibition of repair DNA synthesis. This implies the mechanism may involve perturbation of DNA ligation or activation of a certain process which causes DNA strand breaks. In addition, dATP may interfere with some steps of semiconservative DNA synthesis, but not the repair synthesis of DNA."
