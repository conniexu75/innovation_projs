https://openalex.org/W2137710189,"Specialization of the right hemisphere for spatial processing was studied in 200 normal boys and girls between 6 and 13 years of age. Boys performed in a manner consistent with right hemisphere specialization as early as the age of 6. Girls showed evidence of bilateral representation until the age of 13. The results suggest a sexual dimorphism in the neural organization underlying cognition during a major period of childhood. The results, which have implications for reading instruction, are discussed in terms of a possible sex difference in neural plasticity during development and the clinical consequences of such a difference."

Analgesic tolerance was displayed when rats were tested in that environment in which they previously received morphine, but not in the alternative environment. The results indicate than an association between environmental cues and the systemic effects of morphine is crucial to tolerance development."

https://openalex.org/W2023866291,"Two competing sensations of apparent movement were produced by the rapid alternation of two multielement stimulus frames. Either sensation could be made dominant by, appropriate manipulations of the stimulus display. The results suggest that there are two systems capable of generating movement signals in man. One system depends on preliminary processing of form, and the second system does not."

Normal suckling was immediately reinstated, however, by painting a vacuum distillate of the wash or of pup saliva onto the nipples. Thus, a substance necessary to direct and release suckling, possibly rat pup saliva, appears to coat the nipple surface."

Electron microscopy of DNA cross-linked in chromatin reveals the lengths of protected regions and provides a map of their sites along the DNA. Protected regions occur most frequently in tandem and have a basic length of 160 to 200 base pairs.
https://openalex.org/W2037730820,"To determine whether the prevention of fever affects the survival of an animal infected with pathogenic bacteria, lizards (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) were infected with live Aeromonas hydrophila and received varying doses of sodium salicylate, an antipyretic drug. Twelve lizards received identical injections of bacteria along with a nontoxic dose of sodium salicylate; five animals increased their mean body temperature at least 0.6°C and survived the week, whereas seven did not develop a fever and died within 3 days. These data indicate that in these lizards the prevention of fever by use of an antipyretic drug such as sodium salicylate increases the mortality rate from bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W1537544947,"(--)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol, a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, was used to identify binding sites which have the characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors in membranes from rat adipocytes. The subcellular distribution of the (--)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding sites was examined. The binding sites were predominantly in the plasma membrane fraction, consistent with the proposal that the physiologically significant beta-adrenergic receptors are localized in the adipocyte plasma membrane. Binding of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to unfractionated adipose membranes was saturable with 0.24 pmol bound/mg of protein at saturation. Half-maximal saturation occurred at 15 nM providing an estimate of the equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, for the interaction of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol with its adipocyte receptor. Kinetic analysis of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding provided a value of 2.4 X 10(7) M-1 min-1 for the forward bimolecular rate constant, k1. Dissociation of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol was a first order reaction with a rate constant, k2, of 2.94 X 10(-1) min-1. The ratio k2/k1 = 12 nM provides an independent measurement of the KD for the interaction of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol with its receptor which is in good agreement with the values obtained by steady state analysis (12 to 15 nM). Beta-Adrenergic agonists and antagonists competed for the binding sites in unfractionated adipocyte membranes with a typical beta1-adrenergic specificity. The order of potency of agonists was (--)-isoproterenol greater than (--)-norepinephrine congruent to (--)-epinephrine. The beta-adrenergic antagonist, (--)-propranolol, potently competed for the binding sites with a KD of 17 nM. Compounds such as dihydroxyphenylaline, dihydroxymandelic acid, normetanephrine, pyrocatechol, and phentolamine which are structurally related to beta-adrenergic agents, but are devoid of beta-adrenergic physiologicl effects in adipocytes, did not compete for the binding sites. Binding was highly stereospecific, the (+) isomers of adrenergic agonists and antagonists requiring 23- to 330-fold higher concentrations to half-maximally inhibit binding than the corresponding (--) stereoisomers. (--)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding was examined highly enriched plasma membrane, mitochondrial, and microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) fractions of adipocytes. In the presence of 12 nM (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, the specific activity of binding in the plasma membrane fraction was 5-fold higher than that of the mitochondrial fraction and 8-fold higher than that of the microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) fraction. The specificity and affinity characteristics of the plasma membrane binding sites were found to be virtually identical with those of the unfractionated adipocyte membranes. The observation that (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites are predominantly localized in the plasma membrane fraction suggests the potential usefulness of this ligand as a marker for adipocyte plasma membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1973424231,"Thermally prepared polyamino acids, regarded as models for prebiotic protein, typically have been synthesized at 120 degrees to 200 degrees C. In this study, three different sets of amino acid mixtures were found to yield material of relatively high molecular weight (molecular sieving and diffusion techniques) when heated for up to 81 days at 85 degrees, 75 degrees, and 65 degrees C. These temperatures, which today are generated by radiation from the sun in some terrestrial locales, probably were more common on the prebiotic earth than those above the boiling point of water. The results thus suggest that prebiotic polyamino acids may have been relatively common and widespread."

https://openalex.org/W2031462305,More than one-half of the amount of mevalonate that is metabolized by pathways not leading to sterols is accounted for by the action of the kidneys. Conversion of mevalonate in vivo to squalene and sterols in the kidneys is confined almost entirely to the proximal and distal convoluted tubules in the cortex. More sterol than squalene is synthesized from mevalonate not only in the liver but also in the kidney.

There was a significant decrease in concentration of both hormones in posterior pituitary and in specific areas of the hypothalamus. Supraoptic, paraventricular, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei and the retrochiasmatic area had decreased concentration of one or both hormones following hypertonic saline, while hormone concentration in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and median eminence was unaffected."

The HeLa nucleus retained its integrity in the tobacco cytoplasm up to 6 days after fusion.
https://openalex.org/W1966321362,"Radioactive CO2 was detected in expired air after the administration of 25-hydroxy-[26,27-14C] vitamin d3 to vitamin D-deficient hypocalcemic rats; 14co2 was also detected after the administration of 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-14C] vitamin D3 to rats raised on the same diet. Nephretcomy totally abolished 14CO2 formation after administration of 25-hydroxy-[26,27-14C] vitamin D3 but not after the administration of 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-14C] vitamin D3. The production of 14CO2 commenced within 4 hours after injection of 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-14C] vitamin D3, suggesting a possible relevance of this reaction to the function of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These results at least demonstrate a new metabolic pathway of vitamin D3 metabolism involving the oxidation of a portion of the side chain of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to CO2."

After the intravenous injection of 2 milligrams of colchicine in seven subjects, the calculated zero-time concentration in the plasma was 2.9 +/- 1.5 micrograms per deciliter, and the mean half-time in the plasma was 58 +/- 20 minutes. Declining, but measurable, amounts of colchicine could be detected in urine up to day 9 after the drug was administered."
https://openalex.org/W1507108034,"Disulfide 179-203 of trypsinogen was cleaved and the free sulfhydryls were modified by S-carboxymethylation, S-carboxyamidomethylation, or by S-aminoethylation. The enzymatic properties of the activated, modified zymogens toward specific and nonspecific trypsin substrates were studies. The three S-alkylated trypsins hydrolyzed N-benzoylarginine ethyl ester and N-tosyl-lysine methyl ester with Kcat values similar to those of trypsin but with Km values that were increased by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. The binding constant of the competitive inhibitor benzamidine to the S-alkylated trypsins was increased by 2 orders of magnitude by the modifications. The association constant of soybean trypsin inhibitor with S-carboxyamidomethyl trypsin was several orders of magnitude less than normal. Hydrolysis of benzoyl arginine amide with S-carboxymethyl trypsin was not detected, but this was ascribed to poor binding since a KI of 0.3 M was estimated from competitive inhibition studies. The altered kinetics did not depend on the type of chemical group used for the S-alkylated derivative, nor were the kinetics of any derivative significantly influenced by changes of pH or ionic strength. Nonspecific substrates, such as acetylglycine p-nitrophenyl ester and p-nitrophenylacetate, were hydrolyzed at equal rates by both trypsin and disulfide-modified trypsins, and both substrates had identical kcat/Km ratios with unmodified trypsins. For S-alkylated trypsins, kcat/km with lysine and arginine substrates were lower than normal and were the same order of magnitude as the values found for nonspecific substrates, suggesting normal catalytic behavior but a loss of specificity in binding substrates. The kinetic evidence suggested that the role of disulfide 179-203 in the mechanism of action of trypsin is to maintain the geometry of the specificity pocket by keeping appropriate residues of the pocket in a rigid framework."

https://openalex.org/W1560972900,"The role of phospholipids in the activity of UDP-D-galactose: D-xylose galactosyltransferase (galactosyltransferase I) from embryonic chick cartilage was investigated. Phospholipase C treatment of particulate galactosyltransferase I caused inactivation of this enzyme to the extent of 60 to 70% as well as hydrolysis of 75 to 80% of the membrane phospholipids. Addition of phospholipid restored activity to nearly control levels. The order of effectiveness of various phopholipids in reactivating phospholipase C-treated galactosyltransferase I was as follows: lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine. The effect of phospholipase A on galactosyltransferase I activity was also examined and was found to be concentration-dependent. At concentrations less than 10 mug/mg of pellet protein, phospholipase A slightly activated galactosyltransferase I. whereas at higher concentrations it inhibited the activity in a manner similar to phospholipase C. Galactosyltransferase I was activated moderately and also solubilized by treatment with Nonidet P-40 in the presence of 0.5 M KCl. Following solubilization and purification by gel filtration and affinity chromatography, galactosyltransferase I could be inactivated by detergent removal by dialysis and subsequently reactivated by addition of detergent. Neither phospholipase C treatment nor exogenous phospholipid had any significant effect on three of the other chondroitin sulfate glycosyltransferases (UDP-D-xylose: core protein xylosyltransferase, UDP-D-glucuronic acid:3-O-beta-D-galactosyl-D-galactose glucuronosyltransferase, and UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine:(BlcUA-GalNAc-4-sulfate)j N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase). On lipid analysis by thin layer chromatography, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were found to be the major phospholipids of particulate and solubilized glycosyltransferase preparations from embryonic chick cartilage, while lysopholipids of particulate and solubilized glycosyltransferase preparations from embryonic chick cartilage, while lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine were barely detectable components. The concentration of these specific phospholipids was diminished greatly following phospholipase C treatment."

In 1948, a short but historic note by Alexander Ogston appeared in the scientific magazine Nature, demonstrating the importance of a particular type of stereochemical thinking in relation to biochemical processes catalysed by enzymes_ Up to that time I had, as an organic chemist interested in the synthesis of natural products, the same kind of feeling for stereochemistry that a motorist might have for a system of oneway streets a set of rules forming one more obstacle on the way to a destination_ But 19.48 was a year in which, as well as continuing cohaboration with Robert Robinson on the total synthesis of sterols, I had begun to co-operate with biological scientists at the National Institute for Medical Research; so that Ogston’s note was a seed that germinated the more readily in my mindThe essential principles of the three-dimensional structure of organic molecules had been correctly formulated by the first Nobel laureate in Chemistry, Jacobus van% Hoff, as early as 1874, In particular he (and independently Le Bel) gave a structural basis to Louis Pasteur’s discovery that certain molecules can exist in two opficaZZy active forms that differ from each other in their effect on a beam of plane polarized light; the plane of polarization is rotated to the right when the beam passes through a solution of one form, and to the left when the other form is substituted_ van% Hoff theorized that when a carbon atom in a molecule is attached to its maximum number of four other atoms, these occupy the four apices of a tetrahedron, with the carbon atom in the middle. Another way of saying the same thing is that the four atoms keep as far away from each other as they can, given that they are bound at fixed distances from the central atom. If these four atoms are all different, or at any rate if each forms part of a different group of atoms, they can occupy two distinct spatial arrangements that are chiral: their relationship is that of a right hand with a"

This respirable particulate fraction is defined as particles less than or equal to 5 micrometers. The respirable fraction of surface dust was separated by ultrasonic dispersion and a standard water-sedimentation procedure. Plutonium concentration in this fraction of off-site soils located downwind from the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant (Jefferson County, Colorado) were as much as 380 times the background concentration. It is prposed that this method of evaluation defines more precisely the potential health hazard from the respirable fraction of plutonium-contaminated soils."
