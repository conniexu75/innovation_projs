https://openalex.org/W2060140554,"The limitations of thermochemical energy storage devices are the limitations of Carnot devices. Entropy production entailed in product separation further limits the efficiency of thermochemical processes. Thus, high upper temperatures and few reaction steps are desirable. In this article, the one-step effusional separation of water into hydrogen and oxygen is considered. Membrane materials, design, and fabrication techniques are suggested. A parametric analysis of the process suggests that the idea is a tantalizing possibility."

Both duration and form showed marked stereotypy. It appears that the role of this context-specific social signal in the communication of play intention has been fostered by selection for ""morphological"" stereotypy."
https://openalex.org/W2030945881,The rates of formaldehyde photodecomposition into hydrogen and formyl radicals and hydrogen and carbon monoxide molecules in sunlightirradiated atmospheres have been estimated from extinction data and photochemical results. These data should prove useful in the development of models for the chemical changes that take place in the polluted atmosphere.
https://openalex.org/W2036060013,"During the past several years, a substantial body of experience has accumulated in the use of SYNCHEM, a large-scale program which is able to discover synthesis routes for relatively complex organic structures without on-line guidance on the part of its chemist user. These results indicate that the approach to computer-directed organic synthesis route discovery embodied in the program has been valid and reasonable, and that SYNCHEM is likely to be fruitful from the point of view of its intended users as well as for our research objectives in artificial intelligence. The experiments have revealed a number of insufficiencies in the program as well. Most of these are rectified in SYNCHEM2, a revised version of the program which includes, among other improvements, a more highly developed synthesis search algorithm and the routine consideration of stereochemistry."

Calibration experiments show that these coatings result from an ""ancient"" implantation of solar wind ions in the grains. This phenomenon has interdisciplinary applications concerning the past activity of the sun, the lunar albedo, the ancient lunar atmosphere and magnetic field, the carbon content of lunar soils, and lunar dynamic processes."

This finding suggests that rubber productivity can be improved by the use of chemical agents on guayule and other rubber-forming plants."
https://openalex.org/W1969941225,"Simplified models have been developed to obtain order of magnitude estimates of the oxygen demand of municipal and industrial wastes and of their potential eutrophication effects in the marine environment. The models have been applied to assess two major corrective actions that might be considered for such pollution problems-secondary sewage treatment and ocean outfalls. It is concluded that the arguments for secondary sewage treatment as the proper corrective action are not compelling and that the problem should be reexamined with appropriate scientific and engineering evaluations. One goal of such scientific evaluations should be a more thorough understanding of the life histories of possible trace contaminants and pathogens which may have long biological, chemical, or geological retention times in the marine environment."

https://openalex.org/W1978080531,"The spectral and polarization data for Venus are consistent with micrometer-sized aerosol cloud particles of hydrochloric acid with soluble and insoluble iron compounds, whose source could be volcanic or crustal dust. The yellow color of the clouds could be due to absorption bands in the near ultraviolet involving ferric iron and chlorine complexes. The ultraviolet features could arise from variations in the concentrations of iron and hydrochloric acid in the cloud particles."

https://openalex.org/W1985697562,"Light and dark terrains in and around Meridiani Sinus, mapped on the imagery from Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, were found to have significantly different cumulative size frequency distributions of craters. The light terrain on a mosaic of frames 6N11, 6N13, and 6N19 has a greater proportion of large craters and a lesser proportion of smaller craters than the dark terrain on the same frames. The light terrain is interpreted to be generally older than the dark terrain. The filling or partial filling of the smaller craters on the light terrain by surface detritus is suggested. Several wide-angle frames have remarkably similar cumulative crater size frequency distributions that may be representative of a large portion of the martian surface."
