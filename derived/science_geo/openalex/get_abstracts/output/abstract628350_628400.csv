https://openalex.org/W2915312288,"Background Rapid antibiotic administration is known to improve sepsis outcomes, however early diagnosis remains challenging due to complex presentation. Our objective was to develop a model using readily available electronic health record (EHR) data capable of recognizing infant sepsis at least 4 hours prior to clinical recognition. Methods and findings We performed a retrospective case control study of infants hospitalized ≥48 hours in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia between September 2014 and November 2017 who received at least one sepsis evaluation before 12 months of age. We considered two evaluation outcomes as cases: culture positive–positive blood culture for a known pathogen (110 evaluations); and clinically positive–negative cultures but antibiotics administered for ≥120 hours (265 evaluations). Case data was taken from the 44-hour window ending 4 hours prior to evaluation. We randomly sampled 1,100 44-hour windows of control data from all times ≥10 days removed from any evaluation. Model inputs consisted of up to 36 features derived from routine EHR data. Using 10-fold nested cross-validation, 8 machine learning models were trained to classify inputs as sepsis positive or negative. When tasked with discriminating culture positive cases from controls, 6 models achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) between 0.80–0.82 with no significant differences between them. Including both culture and clinically positive cases, the same 6 models achieved an AUC between 0.85–0.87, again with no significant differences. Conclusions Machine learning models can identify infants with sepsis in the NICU hours prior to clinical recognition. Learning curves indicate model improvement may be achieved with additional training examples. Additional input features may also improve performance. Further research is warranted to assess potential performance improvements and clinical efficacy in a prospective trial."

Intestinal microbiota alterations during adolescence influence the expression of molecular factors involved in neuronal development in both the ENS and CNS. In this study, we have evaluated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in juvenile mice ENS and CNS, after a 2-week antibiotic (ABX) treatment. In both mucosa and mucosa-deprived whole-wall small intestine segments of ABX-treated animals, BDNF and TrKB mRNA and protein levels significantly increased. In longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations of ABX-treated mice the percentage of myenteric neurons staining for BDNF and TrkB was significantly higher than in controls. After ABX treatment, a consistent population of BDNF- and TrkB-immunoreactive neurons costained with SP and CGRP, suggesting up-regulation of BDNF signaling in both motor and sensory myenteric neurons. BDNF and TrkB protein levels were downregulated in the hippocampus and remained unchanged in the prefrontal cortex of ABX-treated animals. Immunostaining for BDNF and TrkB decreased in the hippocampus CA3 and dentate gyrus subregions, respectively, and remained unchanged in the prefrontal cortex. These data suggest that dysbiosis differentially influences the expression of BDNF-TrkB in the juvenile mice ENS and CNS. Such changes may potentially contribute later to the development of functional gut disorders, such as IBS, showing psychiatric comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2917726337,"Cassava mosaic disease, one of the ten most economically important crop viral diseases in the world, was first reported in Southeast Asia from a single plantation in Cambodia in 2015. To determine the presence and incidence of Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV) one year after first detection, a total of 6,480 samples from 419 fields were systematically collected from cassava production areas across Cambodia (3,840 samples; 240 fields) and Vietnam (2,640samples; 179 fields) in the 2016 cropping season. Using PCR-based diagnostics, we identified 49 SLCMV-infected plants from nine fields, representing 2% of the total number of fields sampled. Infected fields were geographically restricted to two provinces of Eastern Cambodia, while no infection was detected from any of the other sampled sites in either country. Symptom expression patterns in infected plants suggested that SLCMV may have been transmitted both through infected planting materials, and by Bemisia tabaci, the known whitefly vector of SLCMV. In addition, 14% of virus infected plants did not express typical symptoms of cassava mosaic disease on their leaves, highlighting that molecular-based validation is needed to confirm the presence of SLCMV in the field. None of the owners of the SLCMV-infected fields indicated acquired planting materials from the plantation in Ratanakiri where SLCMV was first reported. The surveillance baseline data generated for both countries is discussed in light of future options to control and manage cassava mosaic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2917295659,"Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors of a variety of emerging viral pathogens, including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus. This species has established endemic populations in all cities across southern New Mexico sampled to date. Presently, control of Aedes-borne viruses relies on deployment of insecticides to suppress mosquito populations, but the evolution of insecticide resistance threatens the success of vector control programs. While insecticide resistance is quite common in Ae. aegypti field populations across much of the U.S., the resistance status of this species in populations from New Mexico has not previously been assessed.First, we collected information on pesticide use in cities in southern New Mexico and found that the most commonly used active ingredients were pyrethroids. The use of insecticides with the same mode-of-action over multiple years is likely to promote the evolution of resistance. To determine if there was evidence of resistance in some cities in southern New Mexico, we collected Ae. aegypti from the same cities and established laboratory strains to assess resistance to pyrethroid insecticides and, for a subset of populations, to organophosphate insecticides. F2 or F4 generation mosquitoes were assessed for insecticide resistance using bottle test bioassays. The majority of the populations from New Mexico that we analyzed were resistant to the pyrethroids permethrin and deltamethrin. A notable exception to this trend were mosquitoes from Alamogordo, a city that did not report using pyrethroid insecticides for vector control. We screened individuals from each population for known knock down resistance (kdr) mutations via PCR and found a strong association between the presences of the F1534C kdr mutation in the para gene of Ae. aegypti (homologue to F1534C in Musca domestica L.) and pyrethroid resistance.High-level pyrethroid resistance is common in Ae. aegypti from New Mexico and geographic variation in such resistance is likely associated with variation in usage of pyrethroids for vector control. Resistance monitoring and management is recommended in light of the potential for arbovirus outbreaks in this state. Also, alternative approaches to mosquito control that do not involve insecticides should be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2909859796,"Rationale and method Accurately identifying motives to gamble is crucial in the functional analysis of gambling behavior. In this study, a data-driven approach was followed to clarify the factor structure underlying a pool of motives for gambling, selected from the Gambling Motives Questionnaire–Financial (GMQ-F), and the Reasons for Gambling Questionnaire (RGQ), in a sample of regular problem and non-problem gamblers. Additionally, the role of gambling motives in the relationship between root behavioral activation/inhibition systems (BIS/BAS) and gambling severity, frequency, and preferences was explored using structural equation modelling (SEM). Results and conclusions The present study identified Social, Financial, and Fun/thrill-related gambling motives factors, but also a fourth factor in which some positive and negative reinforcement-based motives were grouped into a single and broader Affect regulation factor. This Affect regulation factor shared variance both with BIS and BAS-related measures, and was the only direct predictor of disordered gambling symptoms. The Fun/thrill factor was directly related to frequency of participation in high-arousal, skill-based games, and all factors were related to participation in lower-arousal, chance games (with Social motives negatively predicting both participation in the latter and total severity). In the SEM model, measures of BIS/BAS sensitivity were connected to gambling behavior only through gambling motives. Based on measures of items’ specificity, a shortened Spanish scale (the brief Gambling Motives Inventory, bGMI) is proposed to assess gambling motives in accordance with the observed 4-factor structure."
https://openalex.org/W2915575962,"Vector-borne diseases are an increasing issue to public health, endangering billions of people worldwide. Controlling vector mosquitoes is widely accepted as the most effective way to prevent vector-borne disease outbreaks. Mosquito surveillance is critical for the development of control strategies under the integrated vector management framework. We hypothesize that the effectiveness and reliability of using BG-Sentinel traps for the surveillance strongly depend on the bait used to attract mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of BG-Sentinel traps baited with CO2 and BG-Lure. A total of 72 traps were deployed for 48 hours once a week for four weeks. For the initial 24-hour period, the traps were baited with CO2, and then for an additional 24 hours using the BG-Lure. Collected mosquitoes were analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation for repeated measures analysis. Biodiversity was assessed by the Shannon and Simpson indices and by individual rarefaction curves and SHE profiles. A total of 5,154 mosquitoes were collected, from which 3,514 by traps baited with CO2 and 1,640 mosquitoes by traps baited with BG-Lure. Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were the most abundant and dominant species. Results from the Generalized Estimating Equation models indicated that more than twice as many mosquitoes were attracted CO2 than to the BG-Lure. The comparison of attractiveness of CO2 and BG-Lure to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus was non-significant, suggesting that both species were equally attracted by the baits. The individual rarefaction curves for Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus imply that traps baited with BG-Lure underestimated mosquito species richness compared to those baited with CO2. BG-Lure were less effective in attracting mosquitoes with low abundances and failed to collect Cx. coronator and Cx. nigripalpus, which were consistently collected by traps baited with CO2. According to our results, CO2 significantly (P<0.05) attracted more mosquitoes (2.67 adjusted odds ratios) than the BG-Lure when adjusted for time and species, being more effective in assessing the relative abundance of vector mosquitoes and yielding more trustworthy results. Traps baited with CO2 collected not only more specimens, but also more species in a more consistent pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2916973751,"Salicylic acid (SA) is an effective elicitor to increase taxol production in Pestalotiopsis microspora. Addition of SA at the concentration of 300 μM yielded taxol 625.47 μg L-1, 45- fold higher than that of the control. Elicitation of the role of SA in the fungal taxol biosynthetic pathway revealed that SA enhanced reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids of P. microspora mycelia. This oxidative process stimulates isoprene biosynthetic pathway by triggering expression of the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase gene leading to improved biosynthesis of taxol in P. microspora."
https://openalex.org/W2917832881,"Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine for use against tuberculosis (TB); however, it is known to reduce childhood mortality from infections other than TB. The unspecific protection induced by BCG vaccination has been associated with the induction of memory-like traits of the innate immune system identified as ‘trained’ immunity. In humans and mouse models, in vitro and in vivo BCG training leads to enhanced production of monocyte-derived proinflammatory cytokines in response to secondary unrelated bacterial and fungal pathogens. While BCG has been studied extensively for its ability to induce innate training in humans and mouse models, BCG’s nonspecific protective effects have not been defined in agricultural species. Here, we show that in vitro BCG training induces a functional change in bovine monocytes, characterized by increased transcription of proinflammatory cytokines upon restimulation with the toll-like receptor agonists. Importantly, in vivo, aerosol BCG vaccination in young calves also induced a ‘trained’ phenotype in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), that lead to a significantly enhanced TLR-induced proinflammatory cytokine response and changes in cellular metabolism compared to PBMCs from unvaccinated control calves. Similar to the long-term training effects of BCG reported in humans, our results suggest that in young calves, the effects of BCG induced innate training can last for at least 3 months in circulating immune populations. Interestingly, however, aerosol BCG vaccination did not ‘train’ the innate immune response at the mucosal level, as alveolar macrophages from aerosol BCG vaccinated calves did not mount an enhanced inflammatory response to secondary stimulation, compared to cells isolated from control calves. Together, our results suggest that, like mice and humans, the innate immune system of calves can be ‘trained’; and that BCG vaccination could be used as an immunomodulatory strategy to reduce disease burden in juvenile food animals before the adaptive immune system has fully matured."
https://openalex.org/W2916154891,"Globally, the mental health help-seeking behavior of university students is reported to be poor; less than one-third of university students with common mental disorders (CMDs) report having sought help from formal sources. Failure to seek treatment is associated with prolonged disability and poor mental health outcomes, including suicide. In Ethiopia, little is known about the help-seeking behavior of university students for CMDs.This study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of help seeking, and sources of help sought by Jimma University undergraduate students with CMDs.Seven hundred and sixty students were selected to participate in this cross-sectional study using multi-stage sampling. Sources of help were identified using the Actual Help-Seeking Questionnaire. CMDs were assessed using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Binary logistic regression analysis was used for both univariate and multivariable analysis.Of the sampled students, 58.4% were found to have current CMDs. Of those with current CMDs, 78.4% had sought help for their problems. The majority (83.8%) of participants who sought help did so from informal sources. Compared to students who had 'very good' overall levels of satisfaction with life, those who had 'good', 'fair', and 'poor or very poor' overall level of satisfaction with life were less likely to seek help (p-value = 0.021, 0.014, and 0.011, respectively). Lastly, having no previous history of help-seeking was significantly associated with seeking help for CMDs (p-value<0.001).More than half of Jimma University students were found to have a high risk of CMDs and the majority of those with CMDs sought help from informal sources. Future studies are needed to explore the barriers of seeking help from formal resources, and the effects of not receiving help from formal sources for CMDs symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2916195085,"Telomeric sequences are generally located at the ends of chromosomes; however, they can also be found in non-terminal chromosomal regions when they are known as interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs). Distribution of ITSs across closely related and divergent species elucidates karyotype evolution and speciation as ITSs provide evolutionary evidence for chromosome fusion. In this study, we performed physical mapping of telomeric repeats by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in seven Australian dragon lizards thought to represent derived karyotypes of squamate reptiles and a gecko lizard with considerably different karyotypic feature. Telomeric repeats were present at both ends of all chromosomes in all species, while varying numbers of ITSs were also found on microchromosomes and in pericentromeric or centromeric regions on macrochromosomes in five lizard species examined. This suggests that chromosomal rearrangements from ancestral squamate reptiles to Iguania occurred mainly by fusion between ancestral types of acrocentric chromosomes and/or between microchromosomes, leading to appearance of bi-armed macrochromosomes, and in the reduction of microchromosome numbers. These results support the previously proposed hypothesis of karyotype evolution in squamate reptiles. In addition, we observed the presence of telomeric sequences in the similar regions to heterochromatin of the W microchromosome in Pogona barbata and Doporiphora nobbi, while sex chromosomes for the two species contained part of the nucleolar organiser regions (NORs). This likely implies that these ITSs are a part of the satellite DNA and not relics of chromosome fusions. Amplification of telomeric repeats may have involved heterochromatinisation of sex-specific W chromosomes and play a role in the organisation of the nucleolus."
https://openalex.org/W2915215627,"Exposure to cigarette smoke has been implicated in the progression of cerebrovascular and neurological disorders like stroke through inflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. In this study, we investigated the signaling cascade activated by cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) and cadmium (Cd) resulting in the COX-2 induction in C6 rat astroglia cells. CSE or Cd induced Notch1 cleavage and activated p38 MAPK and CREB signaling pathways in C6 astroglia cells. Knockdown of nicastrin using siRNA or γ-secretase inhibitors, DAPT and L-685,486, reduced Notch1 cleavage and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and CREB, while phosphorylation of ERK and JNK remained unaffected. Additionally, the blockage of γ-secretase activity did not show any effect on the phosphorylation of AKT, another upstream activator of CREB, indicating that γ-secretase-mediated CREB activation occurs via p38 MAPK. γ-secretase inhibitor also inhibited the CSE and Cd-mediated increase in the expression of COX-2. Furthermore, recombinant overexpression of Notch1 intracellular domain resulted in an increase in the expression of COX-2. Notch signaling induced by CSE and Cd induced apoptosis in C6 cells. Our results demonstrate that CSE exposure activated the p38 MAPK and CREB-mediated induction in COX-2 expression in astrocytes via γ-secretase-mediated Notch1 signaling. Our data provides novel insights into the potential mechanism of pro-inflammatory response activated by exposure to cigarette smoke."
https://openalex.org/W2916559409,"Wnts are a family of secreted palmitoleated glycoproteins that play key roles in cell to cell communication during development and regulate stem cell compartments in adults. Wnt receptors, downstream signaling cascades and target pathways have been extensively studied while less is known about how Wnts are secreted and move from producing cells to receiving cells. We used the synchronization system called Retention Using Selective Hook (RUSH) to study Wnt trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi and then to plasma membrane and filopodia in real time. Inhibition of porcupine (PORCN) or knockout of Wntless (WLS) blocked Wnt exit from the ER. Wnt-containing vesicles paused at sub-cortical regions of the plasma membrane before exiting the cell. Wnt-containing vesicles were associated with filopodia extending to adjacent cells. These data visualize and confirm the role of WLS and PORCN in ER exit of Wnts and support the role of filopodia in Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2917492604,"Miscanthus sinensis Andersson is a pioneer plant species that grows naturally at mining sites. Miscanthus sinensis can detoxify aluminium (Al) by producing phytosiderophores, such as chlorogenic acid, citric acid, and malic acid, and localizing Al in cell walls. Root-endophytic Chaetomium cupreum, which produces microbial siderophores, enhances Al tolerance in M. sinensis. However, we could not determine whether the siderophores produced by C. cupreum actually enhance Al tolerance in M. sinensis, because the microbial siderophores have not yet been identified in previous research. The purpose of this study was to clarify how C. cupreum chemically increases Al tolerance in M. sinensis under acidic mining site conditions, especially considering siderophores. Using instrumental analyses, the siderophore produced by C. cupreum was identified as oosporein. Comparison of the stability constant between Al and phytosiderophores and oosporein indicated that oosporein could detoxify Al similarly to chlorogenic acid, which shows higher stability constant than citric acid and malic acid. Inoculation test of C. cupreum onto M. sinensis in acidic mine soil showed that C. cupreum promoted seedling growth, and enhanced Al tolerance via inducing chlorogenic-acid production and producing oosporein. These results suggested that C. cupreum could chemically enhance Al tolerance and might promote growth via reducing excessive Al in cell walls, the main site of Al accumulation. In addition, the chemical enhancement of Al tolerance by C. cupreum might be important for M. sinensis to adapt to acidic mining sites."

It compares the under-five, all-cause mortality for children pre- and post-LLIN campaign relative to children in those areas that had not yet been exposed to the campaign using a difference-in-differences model and controlling for year- and province-fixed effects, and province-level trends in mortality.We find that the campaign led to a 41% decline [3.7 percentage points, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.0] in under-5 mortality risk among children living in rural areas with malaria ecology above the sample median. Results were robust to controlling for household assets and the presence of other health aid programs. No effect was detected in children living in areas with malaria ecology below the median.The findings of this paper make important contributions to the evidence base for the effectiveness of large scale-national LLIN campaigns against malaria. We found that the program was effective in areas of the DRC with the highest underlying risk of malaria. Targeting bednets to areas with greatest underlying risk for malaria may help to increase the efficiency of increasingly limited malaria resources but should be balanced against other malaria control concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2917682417,"EC Directive 2001/93 requires that all pigs have access to proper investigation and manipulation materials. Intensively farmed pigs in Europe are frequently provided with a short metal chain with or without an indestructible object attached to the chain. To date authorities are regarding this as proper enrichment, perhaps with (in)direct reference to the RICHPIG model as a justification. However, it has become increasingly clear that the chains do not provide proper enrichment, and that adding an indestructible object to the end of the chain may even reduce rather than improve pig welfare. To test this hypothesis an expert survey was conducted containing 26 more or less compound questions. On a scale from 0 to 10 experts specified their level of agreement with the hypothesis, the prevalence and welfare scores of nine indestructible enrichment materials. In total 36 experts, mostly pig-welfare scientists, responded (response rate: 39%). Indestructible objects are less prevalent in countries that provide straw (like Sweden and the UK) and outside the EU (US). They are more prevalent in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Finland, while the prevalence seems to be low in Spain. Balls, wood and pipes were provided most frequently: hard wood especially in the UK (as specified in farm assurance); indestructible balls and pipes in Germany and the Netherlands. The experts' score for agreement with the hypothesis was only 4.6 on average (scale 0-10; n = 25). Enrichment materials, ranked from high to low welfare score, were grouped in 5 significance levels as indicated by different superscripts based on Wilcoxon signed rank tests: Branched chains (5.1a), Chain on the floor (4.4b), Hard wood (3.7bc), Pipe (3.5c), Bare chain (3.3c), Short chain (3.1d), Small ball (2.8d), Big ball (2.5d), and Chain hanging too high (1.3e). Branched chains scored significantly better than all other indestructible materials and its welfare score (5.1 on average) was close to the pre-defined level of acceptability (5.5 on a scale from 0, worst, to 10, best). The welfare benefits of adding balls, pipes or hard wood to the metal chain were marginal, and well below what the experts considered acceptable enrichment. The branched-chains design, by contrast, appears to be the most viable alternative. It involves providing a longer chain, i.e. with the free end reaching to floor level, adding 'branches', i.e. several short chains ending at the nose height of the pigs, and providing more chains per pen (i.e. 1 branched chain per 5 pigs). Branched chains should be implemented widely and in the short term as a first step towards, and benchmark for, providing proper enrichment to intensively-farmed pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2916027540,"Adherence to option B+ antiretroviral treatment (ART) is vital to a successful implementation of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) program. Further studies show that optimal viral suppression is also crucial for a successful PMTCT program, however barriers to adherence exist and differ among populations and particularly within few years of its adoption in Tanzania. This study therefore aimed at investigating the level and predictors of adherence to ART option B+ among pregnant and lactating women in rural and urban settings of eastern Tanzania.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 305 pregnant women and lactating mothers on Option B+ regime from six health facilities located in rural and urban settings in Morogoro region in eastern Tanzania. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, as well as bivariate and multivariate logistic regression.Good adherence to option B+ PMTCT drugs was 26.3% and 61.1% among respondents residing in urban and rural areas respectively. The rural residents were 4.86 times more likely to adhere compared to their counterparts in an urban area (aOR = 4.86; 95% CI = 2.91-8.13). Similarly, women with male partners' support in PMTCT were 3.51 times more likely to have good adherence than those without (aOR = 3.51, 95% CI = 1.21-10.15). Moreover, there was a significantly lower odds of adherence to option B+ among those who had been on treatment between one to two years as compared to those had less than one year of treatment (aOR = 0.45; 95%CI = 0.22-0.93).Adherence to PMTCT option B+ antiretroviral drugs treatment among pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers was low and much lower among urban residents. Adherence was significantly predicted by rural residence, male partner support and short duration on ART. Efforts to improve adherence should focus on increasing male participation on PMTCT, tailored interventions to urban residents and those who have been on ART for a long duration."
https://openalex.org/W2916906313,"Background Association between obesity and cardiovascular diseases is well known, however increased susceptibility of obese patients to develop several cancer types is not so commonly known. Current data suggest that poorer overall survival in cancer patients might be associated to non-cancer-related causes such as higher risk of cardiotoxicity in obese patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents. Omentin, a novel adipokine decreased in obesity, is actually in the spotlight due to its favourable effects on inflammation, glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular diseases. Also, recent data showed that in vitro anthracycline-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is counteracted by omentin suggesting its cardioprotective role. Objective Our aim was to evaluate omentin effects against docetaxel toxicity. Results Our data indicate that omentin inhibits docetaxel-induced viability loss and that increased viability is associated to decreased caspase-3 expression and cell death. Although omentin reduces NOX4 expression, it failed to reduce docetaxel-induced reactive oxygen species production. Our results indicate that omentin decreases docetaxel-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, suggesting that cardioprotective role might be associated to ERS inhibition. Conclusion These data suggest that omentin treatment may contribute to decrease susceptibility to DTX-induced cardiotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2917785025,"We evaluated the survival rates and medical expenditure in patients with lung cancer using a nationwide claims database in South Korea. A retrospective observational cohort study design was used, and 2,919 lung cancer patients and their matched controls were included. Medical expenditures were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier sample average method, and patients were categorized into 4 groups by operation and primary treatment method (i.e. Patients with operation: OP = surgery, OP+CTx/RTx = surgery with anti-cancer drugs or radiotherapy; Patients without operation: CTx/RTx = anti-cancer drugs or radiotherapy, Supportive treatment). The 5-year medical expenditure per case was highest in the OP+CTx/RTx group ($36,013), followed by the CTx/RTx ($23,134), OP ($22,686), and supportive treatment group ($3,700). Lung cancer-related anti-cancer drug therapy was the major cost driver, with an average 53% share across all patients. Generalized linear regression revealed that monthly medical expenditure in lung cancer patients, after adjustment for follow-up month, was approximately 3.1-4.3 times higher than that in the control group (cost ratio for OP = 3.116, OP+CTx/RTx = 3.566, CTx/RTx = 4.340, supportive treatment = 4.157). The monthly medical expenditure at end of life was estimated at $2,139 for all decedents, and approximately a quarter of patients had received chemotherapy in the last 3 months. In conclusion, this study presented the quantified treatment costs of lung cancer on various aspects compared with matched controls according to the treatment of choice. In this study, patients with operation incurred lower lifetime treatment costs than patients with CTx/RTx or supportive treatment, indicating that the economic burden of lung cancer was affected by treatment method. Further studies including both cancer stage and treatment modality are needed to confirm these results and to provide more information on the economic burden according to disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2916551792,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that arises from chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with a predisposition for developing IBD. For the majority, the causal variant and target genes affected are unknown. Here, we investigated the CD-associated SNP rs6651252 that maps to a gene desert region on chromosome 8. We demonstrate that rs6651252 resides within a Wnt responsive DNA enhancer element (WRE) and that the disease associated allele augments binding of the TCF7L2 transcription factor to this region. Using CRISPR/Cas9 directed gene editing and epigenetic modulation, we find that the rs6651252 enhancer regulates expression of the c-MYC proto-oncogene (MYC). Furthermore, we found MYC transcript levels are elevated in patient-derived colonic segments harboring the disease-associated allele in comparison to those containing the ancestral allele. These results suggest that Wnt/MYC signaling contributes to CD pathogenesis and that patients harboring the disease-associated allele may benefit from therapies that target MYC or MYC-regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W2917876451,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ biosynthesis. Through its NAD+-biosynthetic activity, NAMPT influences the activity of NAD+-dependent enzymes, such as sirtuins. NAMPT is able to modulate processes involved in the pathogenesis of non-alcohol induced fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the roles NAMPT plays in development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) still remain unknown. Here, we show that ethanol treatment suppresses the expression of Nampt in hepatocytes. Consistently, chronic ethanol administration also reduces Nampt expression in the mouse liver. We next demonstrate that hepatocytes infected with Ad-NAMPT adenovirus exhibit significantly elevated intracellular NAD+ levels and decreased ethanol-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Similarly, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of NAMPT in mice ameliorates ethanol induced hepatic steatosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that SIRT1 is required to mediate the effects of NAMPT on reduction of hepatic TG accumulation and serum ALT, AST levels in ethanol-fed mice. Our results provide important insights in targeting NAMPT for treating alcoholic fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2918161935,"There is a need for novel mechanical devices for dispatching poultry on farm following the introduction of EU Regulation (EC) no. 1099/2009 On the Protection of Animals at the Time of Killing. We examined three novel mechanical killing devices: Modified Armadillo, Modified Rabbit Zinger, a novel mechanical cervical dislocation device; and traditional manual cervical dislocation. The four killing methods were tested on 230 chickens across four batches. We measured behavioural, electroencephalogram and post-mortem outcomes in anesthetized laying hens and broilers at two life stages (juveniles and adults/slaughter age). Graeco Latin-Square designs systematically randomized killing treatment, bird type, age and kill order. All birds were lightly anaesthetized immediately prior to the killing treatment with inhalation of Sevoflurane. The novel mechanical cervical dislocation method had the highest kill success rate (single application attempt only, with no signs of recovery) of a mechanical method (96%). The Modified Armadillo was the least reliable with 49% kill success. Spectral analysis of electroencephalogram signals at 2 s intervals for successfully killed birds only revealed progressive decreases in median frequency alongside increases in total power. Later, total power decreased as the birds exhibited isoelectric electroencephalogram signal. Latencies to pre-defined spectral ranges associated with unconsciousness showed that birds subjected to manual and novel mechanical cervical dislocation achieved these states sooner than birds subjected to the modified Armadillo. Nevertheless all methods exhibited short latencies (<4 s). The Modified Rabbit Zinger had the shortest duration of reflex persistence for nictitating membrane, pupillary and rhythmic breathing post method application. Of the methods tested, the novel mechanical cervical dislocation device is the most promising mechanical method for killing poultry on-farm based on a range of behavioural, electroencephalogram and anatomical parameters. This device has the potential to fulfil the current need for a mechanical alternative to manual cervical dislocation."
https://openalex.org/W2915073637,"Background Malpractice and excess use of antimicrobials have been associated with multiple costs, including the development of resistant bacteria, which has become a threat to the human health. The aim of this study, therefore, was to assess the antibiotic use practice and to identify predictors of hospital outcome to uncover targets for stewardship. Methods An Institution-based prospective observational study was performed from 9 April to 7 July 2014 in the internal medicine wards of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. Patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections during this period were strictly followed and data were abstracted using data abstraction format. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results About half of the attended patients had suspected systemic bacterial infections, in which pneumonia is the most common. Cephalosporins were the most widely prescribed class of drugs in all the wards. Initial antibiotics were empiric in almost all of the cases. About 28% of the ward and 59% of the ICU patients died during the in-hospital stay. The mean length of stay (LoS) was 18.5+12.2 in the wards and 8.9+4.9 days in the ICU. Whilst digestive disease (AOR = 6.94, 95% CI: 2.24, 21.49), different signs and symptoms of disease (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.30, 4.56), sepsis (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.99) and vancomycin use (AOR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.30, 5.21) were independent positive predictors, antibiotic days (> 10) (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.70) was a negative predictor for mortality. On the other hand, hospital-acquired infection (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.05, 8.62), beyond the median antibiotic days (> 10) (AOR = 4.05, 95% CI: 1.96, 8.37) and agent days beyond 21 days (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.01–4.68) were independently associated with prolonged LoS. Conclusion Generally, this observation entails an appropriate infection management and antimicrobial use policy. Any future policy should better start by addressing cases like pneumonia, and sepsis and drugs like cephalosporins."
https://openalex.org/W2917030262,"Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa, including Zambia, where cardiovascular diseases account for 8% of the mortality rates. Despite an increasing number of cardiovascular disease-related studies in Zambia, qualitative studies exploring how cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors are understood in the socioeconomic and cultural contexts are still few. This study, therefore, aimed to analyze the beliefs, perceptions, and behaviors related to cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors among the local residents of Zambia.This qualitative study was conducted from August to September 2014 among healthy residents aged 40 years and above in a rural community in Mumbwa District. We investigated the beliefs, perceptions, and behaviors related to cardiovascular diseases and their potential risk factors in the sociocultural context of Zambia by conducting in-depth interviews and focus group interviews. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis with investigator triangulation.We conducted 34 in-depth interviews and 6 focus group interviews with 27 males and 40 females. Most participants were aware of the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases around them and correctly identified hypertension, excessive salt, sugar, and cooking oil intakes, poor quality cooking oil, consumption of meat or vegetables contaminated with chemicals, obesity, stress [""thinking too much""], lack of physical exercise, and heredity as potential risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, while smoking and alcohol were mentioned by only a few participants. However, they claimed that many of these risk factors were difficult to avoid due to ingrained taste preferences for high salt and sugar, increasingly busy lives that force them to use cooking oil to reduce preparation time, cultural preference for big body size or fatness, especially for women, stigmatized body image attached to HIV, stressful life or life events related to poverty, and financial barriers to affording quality foods and healthcare services. Limited health screening opportunities and the negative impact of HIV-related stigma on health-seeking behavior also emerged as important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.This study revealed that participants are relatively well aware of cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors. However, they engage in high-risk health behaviors, due to ingrained taste preferences, limited knowledge, and unavoidable socioeconomic and cultural circumstances. Results suggest that prevention interventions addressing cardiovascular diseases in rural Zambia should target gaps in knowledge and socioeconomic and cultural barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2915235551,"Avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) is a bone complication that indicates poor functional prognosis. Modern immunosuppressive and steroid-sparing drugs have significantly lowered the occurrence of AVN after kidney transplantation (KT). However, recent data on its incidence rates and risk factors are lacking. Using a large, recent cohort, we sought to investigate AVN incidence and risk factors, with a special focus on mineral and bone disorders. We conducted a cohort study in 805 patients who underwent KT between 2004 and 2014. AVN was identified in 32 patients (4%): before KT in 15 (1.8%) and after KT in 18 (2.2%) cases, including one patient with both. In the group with post-KT AVN, the median time intervals from KT to 1) first symptoms and 2) AVN diagnosis were 12 months [1–99] and 20 months [4–100], respectively. Being overweight/obese, having pre-transplant diabetes or hyperparathyroidism at transplantation, developing acute rejection, and receiving higher cumulative corticosteroid doses were associated with AVN occurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed that BMI ≥ 26 kg/m2 and higher cumulative corticosteroid doses were predictive of AVN. In conclusion, overweight/obesity is a strong risk factor for AVN. Despite a low maintenance dose, the use of corticosteroids—mostly for treatment of acute rejection—remains an independent risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W2918098127,"The proportion of women attending four or more antenatal care (ANC) visits is widely used for monitoring, but provides limited information on quality of care. Effective coverage metrics, assessing if ANC interventions are completely delivered, can identify critical gaps in healthcare service delivery. We aimed to measure coverage of at least one screening and effective coverage of ANC interventions in the public health system in the West Bank, Palestine, and to explore associations between infrastructure-related and maternal sociodemographic variables and effective coverage.We used data from paper-based clinical records of 1369 pregnant women attending ANC in 17 primary healthcare clinics. Infrastructure-related variables were derived from a 2014 national inventory assessment of clinics. Sample size calculations were made to detect effective coverage ranging 40-60% with a 2-3% margin of error, clinics were selected by probability sampling. We calculated inverse probability weighted percentages of: effective coverage of appropriate number and timing of screenings of ANC interventions; and coverage of at least one screening.Coverage of one screening and effective coverage of ANC interventions were notably different for screening for: hypertension (98% vs. 10%); fetal growth abnormalities (66% vs. 6%); anemia (93% vs. 14%); gestational diabetes (93% vs. 34%), and antenatal ultrasound (74% vs. 24%). Clinics with a laboratory and ultrasound generally performed better in terms of effective coverage, and maternal sociodemographic factors had no associations with effective coverage estimates. Only 13% of the women attended ANC visits according to the recommended national schedule, driving effective coverage down.Indicators for ANC monitoring and their definitions can have important consequences for quantifying health system performance and identifying issues with care provision. To achieve more effective coverage in public primary care clinics in the West Bank, efforts should be made to improve care provision according to prescribed guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2916791945,"Elevated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) tissue levels have been associated with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (aTAA). As MMP-2 activation is controlled by interactions among matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14), a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and Pro-MMP-2 in cell culture, this activation process might also play a role in aTAA.Via gelatin zymography we analyzed tissue levels of MMP-2 isoforms (Pro-MMP-2, active MMP-2, total MMP-2) and via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA,) MMP-14,TIMP-2 and total MMP-2 tissue levels in N = 42 patients with aTAA. As controls, MMP-14 and TIMP-2 aortic tissue levels in N = 9 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were measured via ELISA, and levels of MMP-2 isoforms in N = 11 patients via gelatin zymography.Active MMP-2 was significantly higher in aTAA than in controls. Patients with aTAA exhibited significantly lower Pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels. Total MMP-2 and MMP-14 did not differ significantly between groups. Regression analysis revealed a linear relationship between TIMP-2 and the MMP-14/TIMP-2 ratio, as well as active MMP-2 in aTAA. Aneurysmatic tissue can be accurately distinguished from control aortic tissue (AUC = 1) by analyzing the active MMP-2/Pro-MMP-2 ratio with a cutoff value of 0.11, whereas MMP-14 and TIMP-2 roles are negligible in ROC analysis.A larger amount of MMP-2 is activated in aTAA than in control aortic tissue-a factor that seems to be a central process in aneurysm development. When active MMP-2 exceeds 10% compared to Pro-MMP-2, we conclude that it originates from aneurysmatic tissue, which we regard as a starting point for further studies of aTAA biomarkers. The tissue's MMP-14/TIMP-2 ratio may regulate the degree of Pro-MMP-2 activation as a determining factor, while the enzymatic activities of MMP-14 and TIMP-2 do not seem to play a key role in aneurysm development."
https://openalex.org/W2917399107,"The HLA-G and MICA genes are stimulated under inflammatory conditions and code for soluble (sMICA and sHLA-G) or membrane-bound molecules that exhibit immunomodulatory properties. It is still unclear whether they would have a synergistic or antagonistic effect on the immunomodulation of the inflammatory response, such as in chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to a better prognosis after the kidney transplantation. In this study, we went from genetic to plasma analysis, first evaluating the polymorphism of MICA, NKG2D and HLA-G in a cohort from Southern Brazil, subdivided in a control group of individuals (n = 75), patients with CKD (n = 94), and kidney-transplant (KT) patients (n = 64). MICA, NKG2D and HLA-G genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction with specific oligonucleotide probes, Taqman and Sanger sequencing, respectively. Levels of soluble forms of MICA and HLA-G were measured in plasma with ELISA. Case-control analysis showed that the individuals with haplotype HLA-G*01:01/UTR-4 have a lower susceptibility to develop chronic kidney disease (OR = 0.480; p = 0.032). Concerning the group of kidney-transplant patients, the HLA-G genotypes +3010 GC (rs1710) and +3142 GC (rs1063320) were associated with higher risk for allograft rejection (OR = 5.357; p = 0.013 and OR = 5.357, p = 0.013, respectively). Nevertheless, the genotype +3010 GG (OR = 0.136; p = 0.041) was associated with kidney allograft acceptance, suggesting that it is a protection factor for rejection. In addition, the phenotypic analysis revealed higher levels of sHLA-G (p = 0.003) and sMICA (p < 0.001) in plasma were associated with the development of CKD. For patients who were already under chronic pathological stress and underwent a kidney transplant, a high sMICA (p = 0.001) in pre-transplant proved to favor immunomodulation and allograft acceptance. Even so, the association of genetic factors with differential levels of soluble molecules were not evidenced, we displayed a synergistic effect of sMICA and sHLA-G in response to inflammation. This increase was observed in CKD patients, that when undergo transplantation, had this previous amount of immunoregulatory molecules as a positive factor for the allograft acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W2915709916,"Background Social relationships, particularly marriage, have been shown to ameliorate the potentially pathogenic impact of stressful events but prior research has been mostly aimed at downstream effects, with less research on real-time reactivity. Pupillometry is an innovative procedure that allows us to see the effects of acute stress in real time. The muscles that control pupil size are linked to the autonomic nervous system, so that when stressed, the pupils dilate; this occurs within 200ms. This quick response allows us to see the immediate effects of acute stress on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the real-time effects of social support in buffering stress. Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the dampening effects of received social support on the ANS’s pupillary response. Methods Eighty individuals (40 couples) were randomly assigned to either a spousal support (i.e., spouse hand-holding) or non-support condition (i.e., alone) and administered a Stroop task while pupil dilation was measured. Results The Stroop task elicited a stress reaction in terms of pupil dilation in response to the incongruent task trials. Participants in the support condition showed accelerated habituation to the stress task (p < .001), and less pupil reactivity (p < .001) providing evidence for buffering effects of social support via spousal presence and hand-holding. Conclusions These results reveal the speed at which stress-buffering occurs, suggesting that pupillometry could be a good method to address the immediate dampening effects of social support."
https://openalex.org/W2917684292,"C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and its receptor natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B) are physiological potent positive regulators of endochondral bone growth; therefore, the CNP/NPR-B signaling pathway is one of the most promising therapeutic targets for treating growth failure and dwarfism. In this article, we summarized the pharmacological properties of a novel CNP analog peptide ASB20123 as a therapeutic agent for short stature. ASB20123, one of the CNP/ghrelin chimeric peptides, is composed of CNP(1–22) and human ghrelin(12–28, E17D). Compared to CNP(1–22), ASB20123 showed similar agonist activity for NPR-B and improved biokinetics with a longer plasma half-life in rats. In addition, the distribution of ASB20123 to the cartilage was higher than that of CNP(1–22) after single subcutaneous (sc) injection to mice. These results suggested that the C-terminal part of ghrelin, which has clusters of basic amino acid residues and a BX7B motif, might contribute to the retention of ASB20123 in the extracellular matrix of the growth plate. Multiple sc doses of ASB20123 potently stimulated skeletal growth in rats in a dose-dependent manner, and sc infusion was more effective than bolus injection at the same dose. Our data indicated that high plasma levels of ASB20123 would not necessarily be required for bone growth acceleration. Thus, pharmaceutical formulation approaches for sustained-release dosage forms to allow chronic exposure to ASB20123 might be suitable to ensure drug effectiveness and safety."

Here we report the identification of a gene encoding a cell wall-degrading enzyme, pectin methylesterase PME (EC 3.1.1.11), in the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans. Both genomic and coding sequences of the gene were cloned for this species, that included the presence of four introns which eliminated a possible contamination from bacteria. Expression of the Pp-pme gene was localized in the esophageal glands of P. penetrans as determined by in situ hybridization. Temporal expression of Pp-pme in planta was validated at early time points of infection. The possible function and activity of the gene were assessed by transient expression of Pp-pme in plants of Nicotiana benthamiana plants via a Potato virus X-based vector. To our knowledge, this is the first report on identification and characterization of a PME gene within the phylum Nematoda."

Demographic and clinical data were recorded along with a 28-day outcome. Mononuclear cell mtDNA copy number was assessed by quantitative PCR.The 28-day outcome of sepsis patients was significantly associated with circulating mononuclear cell mtDNA copy number. The median mononuclear cell relative mtDNA copy number of survivors was significantly higher than that of nonsurvivors (406.68, range 196.65-625.35 vs. 320.57, range 175.98-437.33, p = 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard survival model analysis indicated that mononuclear cell relative mtDNA copy number was significantly negative associated with the 28-day outcome. For every additional unit of mononuclear cell mtDNA relative copy number, the risk of death falls by 0.1% (HR = 0.999, 95% CI = 0.998 to 1.000, p = 0.017).Our data indicate first that circulating mononuclear cellular mtDNA copy number might be helpful for outcome predictions in sepsis patients, and second that lower mtDNA copy number implied poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2917448056,"Our study investigated body image representations in female patients with anorexia nervosa and healthy controls using a size estimation with pictures of their own body. We also explored a method to reduce body image distortions through right hemispheric activation.Pictures of participants' own bodies were shown on the left or right visual fields for 130 ms after presentation of neutral, positive, or negative word primes, which could be self-relevant or not, with the task of classifying the picture as ""thinner than"", ""equal to"", or ""fatter than"" one's own body. Subsequently, activation of the left- or right hemispheric through right- or left-hand muscle contractions for 3 min., respectively. Finally, participants completed the size estimation task again.The distorted ""fatter than"" body image was found only in patients and only when a picture of their own body appeared on the right visual field (left hemisphere) and was preceded by negative self-relevant words. This distorted perception of the patients' body image was reduced after left-hand muscle contractions (right hemispheric activation).To reduce body image distortions it is advisable to find methods that help anorexia nervosa patients to increase their self-esteem. The body image distortions were ameliorated after right hemispheric activation. A related method to prevent distorted body-image representations in these patients may be Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy."

Simulated and empirical demonstrations of the proposed approaches are included, which emphasize the flexibility and efficacy of the proposed generalization."
https://openalex.org/W2915459369,"Background Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 45γ (GADD45γ) is a member of the DNA damage-inducible gene family which responds to environmental stresses. Apoptosis is a critical mode of renal tubular cell death in nephrotoxin-induced acute kidney injury. In this study, we investigated the role of GADD45γ in renal tubular cell apoptosis induced by nephrotoxic drugs. Methods Primary human renal tubular epithelial (HRE) cells were used in this study. To derive stable cell lines in which GADD45γ expression was silenced, HRE cells were transduced with a plasmid encoding GADD45γ-specific shRNA. The recombinant adenovirus containing the GADD45γ gene was synthesized to overexpress GADD45γ protein. Cell death was induced by cisplatin and cyclosporine A (CsA). To prevent apoptotic cell death, pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK was used. To prevent non-apoptotic cell death, necrostatin-1 and ferrostatin-1 were used. The degree of apoptosis and necrosis of cultured cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results Expression of the GADD45γ gene was significantly upregulated in response to treatment with CsA and cisplatin. Apoptosis and necrosis induced by these drugs were significantly reduced by silencing of GADD45γ, and significantly augmented by the overexpression of GADD45γ. The activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 as well as caspase-9 induced by cisplatin or CsA was reduced by silencing of GADD45γ, and was augmented by the overexpression of GADD45γ, indicating that caspase activation is dependent on the expression of GADD45γ. ZVAD-FMK significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by cisplatin or CsA, indicating a role of caspases in mediating apoptotic cell death. ZVAD-FMK was effective to prevent necrosis as well, indicating that the observed necrosis was a secondary event following apoptosis at least in part. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that GADD45γ is required for the caspase-dependent apoptosis of renal tubular cells induced by nephrotoxic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2915549963,"Bald thigh syndrome is a common hair loss disorder in sighthounds. Numerous possible causes, including environmental conditions, trauma, stress, endocrinopathies and genetic components have been proposed, but only endocrinopathies have been ruled out scientifically. The overall goal of our study was to identify the cause of bald thigh syndrome and the pathological changes associated with it. We approached this aim by comparing skin biopsies and hair shafts of affected and control dogs microscopically as well as by applying high-throughput technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. While the histology is rather unspecific in most cases, trichogram analysis and scanning electron microscopy revealed severe structural abnormalities in hair shafts of affected dogs. This finding is supported by the results of the transcriptomic and proteomic profiling where genes and proteins important for differentiation of the inner root sheath and the assembly of a proper hair shaft were downregulated. Transcriptome profiling revealed a downregulation of genes encoding 23 hair shaft keratins and 51 keratin associated proteins, as well as desmosomal cadherins and several actors of the BMP signaling pathway which is important for hair shaft differentiation. The lower expression of keratin 71 and desmocollin 2 on the mRNA level in skin biopsies corresponded with a decreased protein expression in the hair shafts of affected dogs. The genetic analysis revealed a missense variant in the IGFBP5 gene homozygous in all available Greyhounds and other sighthounds. Further research is required to clarify whether the IGFBP5 variant represents a predisposing genetic risk factor. We conclude from our results that structural defects in the hair shafts are the cause for this well-known disease and these defects are associated with a downregulation of genes and proteins essential for hair shaft formation. Our data add important knowledge to further understand the molecular mechanisms of HF morphogenesis and alopecia in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2916979100,"Oocyte ageing is the most important factor affecting egg quality of several fish species after ovulation. Oxidative stress has been proposed as the initiator of the oocyte ageing process in other vertebrates. To identify the role of oxidative stress and apoptosis on the progress of oocyte ageing in the common carp Cyprinus carpio, changes in the relative mRNA abundance of selected transcripts were examined. The possible alteration in the oxidation status of the oocytes during ageing was also studied. In addition, the activity of antioxidant enzymes during oocyte ageing was evaluated. Oocytes from 6 females were incubated in vivo for 14 hours post-ovulation (HPO) and in vitro for 10 hours post-stripping (HPS) at 20°C before fertilization. Hatching rates were over 65% up to 4–6 HPO, finally dropping to 1.3% at 12–14 HPO.Hatching rates were over 65% up to 4–6 HPO, finally dropping to 1.3% at 12–14 HPO. Hatching rates were more than 70% for the eggs stored in vitro up to 6 HPS and then decreased to 21.3% at 10 HPS. The results demonstrated no significant changes in the relative mRNA levels of oxidative stress-related genes or genes involved in the cell cycle during the progress of oocyte ageing in common carp. Additionally, the amount of TBARS and carbonyls did not change as time elapsed following ovulation. The apoptosis-related genes however, were significantly altered following the prolonged time interval between ovulation and fertilization. The lack of response of both activities of antioxidant enzymes and oxidation products during oocyte ageing strengthens the conclusion that oxidative stress is unlikely to be a main factor determining the progress of oocyte ageing in common carp. However, an increase in the mRNA abundance of apoptosis-related genes demonstrates that apoptotic pathway might be involved in the progress of oocyte ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2917868616,"This study aims to assess prospectively whether there is an association between frequencies of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) or asthma in early childhood and failed otoacoustic emission (OAE) screenings later in life. There are no clear recommendations for hearing testing following acute otitis media (AOM) infection. This is a retrospective, practice based chart review. Participants from a primary care setting were 517 pre-adolescent and adolescent children (49.9% female) (ages 10–21; mean, 15 y/o), who had presented with at least one specific bacterial URTI (AOM, Group A Streptococcus (GAS) tonsillitis, or Influenza) during childhood. Hearing testing was recorded incidentally at all subsequent routine health care maintenance visits (OAE hearing screen). Simple linear regression analyses were performed using R (v3.4.4). We found that number of episodes of AOM infections strongly correlated with number of failed OAE screenings later in life (F = 76.37; P = <0.001; R2 = 0.1279), while GAS (F = 1.859; P = 0.1733; R2 = 0.0016) or Influenza infection (F = 2.624; P = 0.1059; R2 = 0.0031) were not associated with failed OAE screening. Correlation between number of AOM infections and number of failed OAE screenings was not strengthened by presence of asthma. This study found evidence of an association between childhood history of AOM and failed OAE screenings in adolescence. Since this population may be at a higher risk for developing permanent or fluctuating hearing losses, further studies to clarify indications and timing of standard audiological testing among these children should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2918135778,"In Ghana, initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients with an HIV diagnosis, regardless of CD4+ T-cell count. However, measurement of CD4 count remains an important metric for identifying patients with advanced HIV disease, and assessing a person's overall immune status, which informs the decision to offer opportunistic infection screening and prophylaxis. Access to CD4+ T cell count in rural health facilities remains a major challenge in Ghana and other resource-limited settings. This study aimed to validate the accuracy of the BD FACSPresto near-patient device for measurement of CD4 count and hemoglobin concentration against the FACSCount (CD4) and Sysmex (hemoglobin) diagnostic machines when operated in both a district hospital and rural laboratory, serving a network of health posts in Ashanti Region, Ghana.In the first phase of the study, patients were recruited from a district hospital, and both venous and capillary blood samples were tested using the FACSCount and Sysmex as reference tests and compared to results of the FACSPresto performed in the clinic laboratory at the district hospital. In the second phase, patients were recruited from both the hospital and from rural health clinics, and samples were tested using the FACSPresto at a rural laboratory. Sensitivity and specificity among samples categorized into different clinically relevant CD4 count ranges were calculated, along with correlation between the Presto and the reference measurements, and mean and relative bias with limits of agreement.The FACSPresto was successfully operated in both clinical settings. A total of 59 samples in the first phase and 48 samples in the second phase were included. Positive bias was observed when comparing CD4 count measured by BD FACSPresto to FACSCount in the district hospital (bias = 44, LOA -72,160) and in the rural laboratory setting (bias = 74, LOA -96, 244). In addition, capillary blood samples were shown to give higher measures when compared to venous blood samples from the same participant. All results were statistically significant (p<0.05) apart from hemoglobin measurement in venous blood in the rural laboratory. Correlation coefficients were high for CD4 count measures and lower for hemoglobin measures.Overall, the Presto gave higher estimates of CD4 count compared to FACSCount, and hemoglobin measurements were higher than from Sysmex. Samples of capillary blood in turn gave higher results for both measurements compared to venous blood, consistent with previous analyses. These findings should be considered when selecting CD4 count machines for use at the point of care, especially in remote areas where capillary blood sampling may be preferable, but are likely balanced by device's ease of use, portability, and ability to expand access to services. These results are some of the first to demonstrate the accuracy of the FACSPresto in West Africa and show that this device can be successfully operated in a very rural lab setting and may therefore assist to provide CD4 count and hemoglobin concentration measurement to populations in need."
https://openalex.org/W2915107095,"The inflammatory response is considered a defence mechanism against physical or infectious insults and is prevalent within the central nervous system. Seizures also result in a robust inflammatory cascade, leading to enhanced activation of excitatory synaptic networks. Ample evidence based on animal models of epilepsy has demonstrated that celecoxib, a highly selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, has anticonvulsant effects. We aimed to evaluate the impact of celecoxib on the cortical excitability and electrophysiological properties of the brain in healthy humans. Electroencephalography (EEG) or transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to measure neurophysiological activity. Forty healthy volunteers were randomized to 4 groups (n = 10 in each group): 1) celecoxib and EEG, 2) placebo and EEG, 3) celecoxib and TMS, and 4) placebo and TMS. For the EEG study, resting EEG was performed at baseline just before administering 400 mg of celecoxib or placebo and repeated 4 hours after administration. The subjects took 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo twice a day for 7 subsequent days, and a third EEG was conducted 4 hours after the final dose. Power spectra were compared at each time point. For the TMS study, the resting motor threshold (RMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) peak-to-peak amplitude, and cortical silent period (CSP) were measured at baseline and after taking 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo twice a day for 7 days. Celecoxib did not significantly change brain activity in the EEG study. However, the sum of power recorded from all electrodes tended to increase in the celecoxib group only at 4 hours after administration (p = 0.06). In detail, one dose of celecoxib (400 mg) transiently and significantly increased the alpha band power recorded in the frontal and parietal areas as well as in the whole brain (p = 0.049, 0.017, and 0.014, respectively) and the beta frequency in the central and parietal regions (p = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively), whereas the placebo did not. This effect was abolished after 7 days of treatment. In the TMS study, we found no statistically significant change in the RMT, MEP peak-to-peak amplitude or CSP. This evidence suggests that celecoxib transiently alters the electrophysiological properties of the brain but does not suppress neuronal excitability in healthy humans."
https://openalex.org/W2915339063,"Metallosphaera sedula is a thermoacidophilic archaeon and has an incomplete TCA/glyoxylate cycle that is used for production of biosynthetic precursors of essential metabolites. Citrate synthase from M. sedula (MsCS) is an enzyme involved in the first step of the incomplete TCA/glyoxylate cycle by converting oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA into citrate and coenzyme A. To elucidate the inhibition properties of MsCS, we determined its crystal structure at 1.7 Å resolution. Like other Type-I CS, MsCS functions as a dimer and each monomer consists of two distinct domains, a large domain and a small domain. The oxaloacetate binding site locates at the cleft between the two domains, and the active site was more closed upon binding of the oxaloacetate substrate than binding of the citrate product. Interestingly, the inhibition kinetic analysis showed that, unlike other Type-I CSs, MsCS is non-competitively inhibited by NADH. Finally, amino acids and structural comparison of MsCS with other Type-II CSs, which were reported to be non-competitively inhibited by NADH, revealed that MsCS has quite unique NADH binding mode for non-competitive inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2916026870,"Many biological data acquisition platforms suffer from inadvertent inclusion of biologically irrelevant variance in analyzed data, collectively termed batch effects. Batch effects can lead to difficulties in downstream analysis by lowering the power to detect biologically interesting differences and can in certain instances lead to false discoveries. They are especially troublesome in predictive modelling where samples in training sets and test sets are often completely correlated with batches. In this article, we present BARA, a normalization method for adjusting batch effects in predictive modelling. BARA utilizes a few reference samples to adjust for batch effects in a compressed data space spanned by the training set. We evaluate BARA using a collection of publicly available datasets and three different prediction models, and compare its performance to already existing methods developed for similar purposes. The results show that data normalized with BARA generates high and consistent prediction performances. Further, they suggest that BARA produces reliable performances independent of the examined classifiers. We therefore conclude that BARA has great potential to facilitate the development of predictive assays where test sets and training sets are correlated with batch."
https://openalex.org/W2916693919,"Senile plaques are well-known hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Diseases (AD). However, drugs targeting tangles of the protein tau and plaques of β-amyloid have no significant effect on disease progression, and the studies on the underlying mechanism of AD remain in high demand. Growing evidence supports the protective role of senile plaques in local inflammation driven by S100A9. We herein demonstrate that oleic acid (OA) micelles interact with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and promote its amyloid formation. Consequently, SH-SY5Y cell line and mouse neural stem cells are rescued from OA toxicity by co-aggregation of OA and HEWL. Using atomic force microscopy in combination with fluorescence microscopy, we revealed that HEWL forms round-shaped aggregates in the presence of OA micelles instead of protofibrils of HEWL alone. These HEWL amyloids act as a sink for toxic OA micelles and their co-aggregate form large clumps, suggesting a protective function in amyloid and OA cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2917079883,"Background Liposomes are employed as drug delivery vehicles offering a beneficial pharmacokinetic/distribution mechanism for in vivo therapeutics. Therapeutic liposomes can be designed to target specific cell types through the display of epitope-specific targeting peptides on their surface. The majority of peptides are currently attached by chemical modification of lipid constituents. Here we investigate an alternative and novel method of decorating liposomes with targeting ligand, using remotely and spontaneously inserting chimeric tail-anchored membrane (TA) proteins to drug loaded liposomes. Methods and results An artificial TA protein chimera containing the transmembrane domain from the spontaneously inserting TA protein cytochrome b5 (Cytb5) provided a robust membrane tether for the incorporation of three different targeting moieties into preformed liposomes. The moieties investigated were the transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide, the EGF-receptor binding sequence GE11 and the placental and tumour homing ligand CCGKRK. In all cases, TA protein insertion neither significantly altered the size of the liposomes nor reduced drug loading. The efficacy of this novel targeted delivery system was investigated using two human cell lines, HeLa M and BeWo. Short term incubation with one ligand-modified TA chimera, incorporating the TAT peptide, significantly enhanced liposomal delivery of the encapsulated carboxyfluorescein reporter. Conclusion The Cytb5 TA was successfully employed as a membrane anchor for the incorporation of the desired peptide ligands into a liposomal drug delivery system, with minimal loss of cargo during insertion. This approach therefore provides a viable alternative to chemical conjugation and its potential to accommodate a wider range of targeting ligands may provide an opportunity for enhancing drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2917835163,"Automated quantitative image analysis is essential for all fields of life science research. Although several software programs and algorithms have been developed for bioimage processing, an advanced knowledge of image processing techniques and high-performance computing resources are required to use them. Hence, we developed a cloud-based image analysis platform called IMACEL, which comprises morphological analysis and machine learning-based image classification. The unique click-based user interface of IMACEL's morphological analysis platform enables researchers with limited resources to evaluate particles rapidly and quantitatively without prior knowledge of image processing. Because all the image processing and machine learning algorithms are performed on high-performance virtual machines, users can access the same analytical environment from anywhere. A validation study of the morphological analysis and image classification of IMACEL was performed. The results indicate that this platform is an accessible and potentially powerful tool for the quantitative evaluation of bioimages that will lower the barriers to life science research."
https://openalex.org/W2915165108,"The current study seeks confirmation for the hypothesis that 2D:4D (positively) predicts prosociality when people are more likely to rely on intuition than deliberation. We assess intuition and deliberation using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and measure prosociality via the validated Social Value Orientation (SVO) slider measure. Although our results do not provide collective evidence for our main proposition, we observe in the data that for low (right) 2D:4D men, the more intuitive they are, the less prosocial they become, whereas for high (right) 2D:4D men the thinking style does not affect their prosociality. Importantly, we find that two alternative measures of cognitive reflection, CRT and CRT-2, differently relate to prosocial decision making such that only CRT-2 (but not the classic CRT) positively predicts prosociality. Given that previous research on the role of cognitive reflection and 2D:4D in prosocial decision making provided inconsistent results, the present study findings are highly valuable to get a better understanding in this domain of study. Furthermore, some of our findings invite further confirmatory tests, thereby opening up multiple avenues for further research."
https://openalex.org/W2915820243,"Background Under-nutrition in early childhood has harmful impacts on human capital formation in children, with implications for educational, adult health, and labor market outcomes. We investigate the association of linear growth and weight gain in mid-childhood with years of schooling, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score, and math test score during the adolescent age of 14–15 years. Methods Data were derived from the Young Lives study conducted in four low- and middle-income countries (Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam). The data had detailed information on the children anthropometry and characteristics of the child, household, and community. Multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for the confounding variables, was used to investigate the association between mid-childhood health, measured by conditional linear growth and relative weight gain, and human capital outcomes in adolescent age. Results After controlling for several confounders, one cm increase in conditional linear growth increased years of schooling by 0.034 years and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score and math test score by 0.474 and 0.083 points respectively. Relative weight gain was negatively associated with years of schooling and math test score. There is no evidence of heterogeneous effects by rural, gender, and household wealth. In the quantile regression analyses, the association between conditional linear growth and outcomes is stronger at the lower level of years of schooling and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score. Conclusion Our study highlights that mid-childhood nutritional intervention targeted for students at the lower level of education distribution can accelerate the rate of human capital accumulation in low- and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2915707533,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the menstrual cycle on responses to a dichotic listening task. It was hypothesized that participants would exhibit a stronger right ear advantage during the menstrual cycle days when estrogen levels are at their peak. It was also hypothesized that the women not taking oral contraceptives would exhibit greater variations in ear advantage over the course of their menstrual cycle than those taking oral contraceptives. Finally, it was hypothesized that the error response rates would remain similar across different listening conditions and over the menstrual cycle. The participants were 30 women who took oral contraceptives and 15 who did not. They completed nine listening sessions comprised of three dichotic listening tasks: forced-left, forced-right, and open. The data were analyzed using a mixed effects models. The participants exhibited a reduction in right ear responses on the days that corresponded to when the level of estrogen would begin to increase. This response was different from what had been hypothesized. The analysis also indicated no response differences between the two groups of women. In addition, the women exhibited fewer errors over the course of the sessions, implying that they adapted to the task. The results indicate that the women's hormone fluctuation across the menstrual cycle affected their responses to the forced-left, cognitive control, task only."
https://openalex.org/W2916321816,"The German Infection Protection Act requires notifying certain cases of infectious diseases to local health departments (LHD) in Germany. LHDs transmit notifications meeting case definitions to the national health authority, where the proportion of discarded notifications is not known. The proportion of discarded cases at the level of LHDs can be expressed as the positive predictive value (PPV) of the notification system. The PPV can be used to assess the efficiency of the system. We quantified the proportion of discarded notifications to calculate the PPV of the German notification system at the level of LHDs using electronic notification data from Berlin LHDs from 2012. We also analysed reasons for discarding notifications by reviewing notification forms. Data was available from eight LHDs (67%) receiving 10,113 notifications in 2012. Overall PPV was 89% (minimum-maximum = 77-97% across LHDs) and ranging from 30% (Hepatitis B) to 99% (Rotavirus). Of 166 individual investigation forms 84% were on hepatitis B or C cases, most of them discarded because of previously diagnosed chronic disease. LHDs investigate many notifications that do not lead to public health action and useful surveillance data leading to inefficient use of resources. Adaptation of case definitions or the legal framework concerning notifications may increase the efficiency of the notification system and lead to better use of data from notified cases."
https://openalex.org/W2917915259,"Invasive mold infections are life-threatening complications in patients with hematological malignancies. Conventional microbiological methods for diagnosing invasive pulmonary mold infections have low sensitivity, and molecular methods are being developed. Detection of molds using PCR with a narrow spectrum has been reported, but data with broad-spectrum PCR are lacking. In this study, the diagnostic performance and utility of a broad-spectrum PCR (broad-spectrum PCR with subsequent electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, PCR/ESI-MS) for detection of molds in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in 27 hematological patients with a new pulmonary infiltrate was analyzed. Using the revised EORTC/MSG criteria, PCR/ESI-MS was the only positive microbiological test in patients with proven invasive mold infection (n = 2) and correctly identified all cases of probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (n = 5). In patients with a possible invasive mold infection (n = 5), PCR/ESI-MS was positive in three patients. Mucorales was identified with PCR/ESI-MS in four patients that were all culture negative. The PCR/ESI-MS results had a clinical impact on antifungal therapy in 12 (44%) of the patients: modification of treatment in 6 (22%) patients and discontinuation in 6 (22%) patients. This study provides proof of concept that routine use of a broad-spectrum PCR for molds in bronchoalveolar lavage in immunocompromised patients is sensitive, fast, and has an impact on clinical decision-making."
