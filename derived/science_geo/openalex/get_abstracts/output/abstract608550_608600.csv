https://openalex.org/W2797670585,"Metabolites play essential roles in biological systems, but detailed identities and significance of the seminal plasma metabolome related to bull fertility are still unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine the comprehensive metabolome of seminal plasma from Holstein bulls and to ascertain the potential of metabolites as biomarkers of bull fertility. The seminal plasma metabolome from 16 Holstein bulls with two fertility rates were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Multivariate and univariate analyses of the data were performed, and the pathways associated with the seminal plasma metabolome were identified using bioinformatics approaches. Sixty-three metabolites were identified in the seminal plasma of all bulls. Fructose was the most abundant metabolite in the seminal fluid, followed for citric acid, lactic acid, urea and phosphoric acid. Androstenedione, 4-ketoglucose, D-xylofuranose, 2-oxoglutaric acid and erythronic acid represented the least predominant metabolites. Partial-Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) revealed a distinct separation between high and low fertility bulls. The metabolites with the greatest Variable Importance in Projection score (VIP > 2) were 2-oxoglutaric acid and fructose. Heat-map analysis, based on VIP score, and univariate analysis indicated that 2-oxoglutaric acid was less (P = 0.02); whereas fructose was greater (P = 0.02) in high fertility than in low fertility bulls. The current study is the first to describe the metabolome of bull seminal plasma using GC-MS and presented metabolites such as 2-oxoglutaric acid and fructose as potential biomarkers of bull fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2797430502,"The microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that tau also plays a role in disorders of neuronal connectivity, including epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. Animal studies have shown that the MAPT gene, which codes for the tau protein, undergoes complex pre-mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms during brain development. Human data, particularly on temporal and regional variation in tau splicing during development are however lacking. In this study, we present the first detailed examination of the temporal and regional sequence of MAPT alternative splicing in the developing human brain. We used a novel computational analysis of large transcriptomic datasets (total n = 502 patients), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting to examine tau expression and splicing in post-mortem human fetal, pediatric and adult brains. We found that MAPT exons 2 and 10 undergo abrupt shifts in expression during the perinatal period that are unique in the canonical human microtubule-associated protein family, while exon 3 showed small but significant temporal variation. Tau isoform expression may be a marker of neuronal maturation, temporally correlated with the onset of axonal growth. Immature brain regions such as the ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip had very low tau expression, but within more mature regions, there was little variation in tau expression or splicing. We thus demonstrate an abrupt, evolutionarily conserved shift in tau isoform expression during the human perinatal period that may be due to tau expression in maturing neurons. Alternative splicing of the MAPT pre-mRNA may play a vital role in normal brain development across multiple species and provides a basis for future investigations into the developmental and pathological functions of the tau protein."
https://openalex.org/W2796828859,"During neuronal development, the microtubule-associated protein tau becomes enriched in the axon, where it remains concentrated in the healthy brain. In tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, tau redistributes from the axon to the somatodendritic compartment. However, the cellular mechanism that regulates tau's localization remains unclear. We report here that tau interacts with the Ca2+-regulated plasma membrane–binding protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) via tau's extreme N terminus encoded by the first exon (E1). Bioinformatics analysis identified two conserved eight-amino-acids-long motifs within E1 in mammals. Using a heterologous yeast system, we found that disease-related mutations and pseudophosphorylation of Tyr-18, located within E1 but outside of the two conserved regions, do not influence tau's interaction with AnxA2. We further observed that tau interacts with the core domain of AnxA2 in a Ca2+-induced open conformation and interacts also with AnxA6. Moreover, lack of E1 moderately increased tau's association rate to microtubules, consistent with the supposition that the presence of the tau–annexin interaction reduces the availability of tau to interact with microtubules. Of note, intracellular competition through overexpression of E1-containing constructs reduced tau's axonal enrichment in primary neurons. Our results suggest that the E1-mediated tau–annexin interaction contributes to the enrichment of tau in the axon and is involved in its redistribution in pathological conditions."

We reviewed the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in order to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in stroke survivors as measured by the Euro Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D), and to find out influencing factors. A total of 42,500 subjects were enrolled in the KNHANES, and 575 of them were persons with stroke. The EQ-5D index was lower in persons with stroke than those without stroke, when adjusted for age and sex (with stroke: 0.757±0.012, without stroke: 0.948±0.001, p < .0001). Dimension-specific influencing factors of HRQoL were observed in persons with stroke; mobility problems increased with old age; self-care problems increased with old age and depression; usual activity problems increased with old age, low income, absence of economic activity, and depression; pain/discomfort problems increased with low income. The EQ-5D index was lower in stroke survivors with older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lack of regular exercise. This is the first study to utilize nationally representative data of the Korean population to investigate the effect of stroke on HRQoL and explore the dimension-specific influencing factors. Further development of rehabilitative interventions for post-stroke depression, vocational rehabilitation, and tailored programs for encouraging physical activity may be needed to improve the HRQoL in Korean stroke survivors."

For example, anaerobic mineral-respiring bacteria can use external metal oxides as terminal electron acceptors during respiration. Porin–cytochrome complexes facilitate the movement of electrons generated through intracellular catabolic processes across the bacterial outer membrane to these terminal electron acceptors. In the mineral-reducing model bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, this complex is composed of two decaheme cytochromes (MtrA and MtrC) and an outer-membrane β-barrel (MtrB). However, the structures and mechanisms by which porin–cytochrome complexes transfer electrons are unknown. Here, we used small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to study the molecular structure of the transmembrane complexes MtrAB and MtrCAB. Ab initio modeling of the scattering data yielded a molecular envelope with dimensions of ∼105 × 60 × 35 Å for MtrAB and ∼170 × 60 × 45 Å for MtrCAB. The shapes of these molecular envelopes suggested that MtrC interacts with the surface of MtrAB, extending ∼70 Å from the membrane surface and allowing the terminal hemes to interact with both MtrAB and an extracellular acceptor. The data also reveal that MtrA fully extends through the length of MtrB, with ∼30 Å being exposed into the periplasm. Proteoliposome models containing membrane-associated MtrCAB and internalized small tetraheme cytochrome (STC) indicate that MtrCAB could reduce Fe(III) citrate with STC as an electron donor, disclosing a direct interaction between MtrCAB and STC. Taken together, both structural and proteoliposome experiments support porin–cytochrome–mediated electron transfer via periplasmic cytochromes such as STC.

https://openalex.org/W2797060817,"Lipoproteins are complex molecular assemblies that are key participants in the intricate cascade of extracellular lipid metabolism with important consequences in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions and the development of cardiovascular disease. Multiplexed mass spectrometry (MS) techniques have substantially improved the ability to characterize the composition of lipoproteins. However, these advanced MS techniques are limited by traditional pre-analytical fractionation techniques that compromise the structural integrity of lipoprotein particles during separation from serum or plasma. In this work, we applied a highly effective and gentle hydrodynamic size based fractionation technique, asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4), and integrated it into a comprehensive tandem mass spectrometry based workflow that was used for the measurement of apolipoproteins (apos A-I, A-II, A-IV, B, C-I, C-II, C-III and E), free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol esters (CE), triglycerides (TG), and phospholipids (PL) (phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)). Hydrodynamic size in each of 40 size fractions separated by AF4 was measured by dynamic light scattering. Measuring all major lipids and apolipoproteins in each size fraction and in the whole serum, using total of 0.1 ml, allowed the volumetric calculation of lipoprotein particle numbers and expression of composition in molar analyte per particle number ratios. Measurements in 110 serum samples showed substantive differences between size fractions of HDL and LDL. Lipoprotein composition within size fractions was expressed in molar ratios of analytes (A-I/A-II, C-II/C-I, C-II/C-III. E/C-III, FC/PL, SM/PL, PE/PL, and PI/PL), showing differences in sample categories with combinations of normal and high levels of Total-C and/or Total-TG. The agreement with previous studies indirectly validates the AF4-LC-MS/MS approach and demonstrates the potential of this workflow for characterization of lipoprotein composition in clinical studies using small volumes of archived frozen samples."
https://openalex.org/W2798217573,"Camellia nitidissima Chi (CNC) is a valuable medicinal and edible plant in China. In this study, CNC flowers were extracted with 95% ethanol, then partitioned into dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water fractions, with the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals in CNC flowers investigated for the first time. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content (TPC) compared with the other fractions. Furthermore, in the ethyl acetate fraction, the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of ABTS+ and DPPH radical scavenging activities were 64.24 ± 1.80 and 78.80 ± 0.34 μg/mL, respectively, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was 801.49 ± 2.30 μM FeSO4 at 1,000 μg/mL. Pearson's correlation coefficients and principal component analyses (PCA) for the TPC and antioxidant capacity of the five fractions indicated that the phenolic compounds were the major antioxidant constituents in the flowers. To exploit the antioxidants in CNC flowers, 21 phenolic compounds in the ethanolic extract fraction were identified by HPLC Triple TOF MS/MS, next, 12 flavonoids were isolated and elucidated, of which compounds 1-5 showed potent antioxidant capacity. In addition, the potential structure-activity relationship among these 12 flavonoids showed that (1) the o-catechol group in the B-ring was primarily responsible for the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids and (2) steric hindrance, produced by glycosides and other groups, could reduce the antioxidant capacity of the flavonoids."
https://openalex.org/W2797034886,"Almost one third of the three million people in China suffering severe deafness are children, and 50% of these cases are believed to have genetic components to their etiology. Newborn hearing genetic screening can complement Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening for the diagnosis of congenital hearing loss as well as identifying children at risk for late-onset and progressive hearing impairment. The aim of this joint academic and Ministry of Health project was to prototype a cost effective newborn genetic screen in a community health setting on a city-wide level, and to ascertain the prevalence of variation at loci that have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. With the participation of 143 local hospitals in the city of Wuhan, China we screened 142,417 neonates born between May 2014 and Dec. 2015. The variants GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G, and mitochondrial variants m.1555A>G and m.1494C>T were assayed using real time PCR. Newborns found to carry a variant were re-assayed by sequencing in duplicate. Within a subset of 707 newborns we assayed using real-time PCR and ARMS-PCR to compare cost, sensitivity and operating procedure. The most frequent hearing loss associated allele detected in this population was the 235delC variant in GJB2 gene. In total, 4289 (3.01%) newborns were found to carry at least one allele of either GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G or two assayed MT-RNR1 variants. There was complete accordance between the real-time PCR and the ARMS PCR, though the real-time PCR had a much lower failure rate. Real-time PCR had a lower cost and operating time than ARMS PCR. Ongoing collaboration with the participating hospitals will determine the specificity and sensitivity of the association of the variants with hearing loss at birth and arising in early childhood, allowing an estimation of the benefits of newborn hearing genetic screening in a large-scale community setting."
https://openalex.org/W2796717065,"Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are in vivo electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy."

We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p<0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2796848831,"As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAXn) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). Bacillus subtilis MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAXn to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%. Crude xylan extracted with NaOH revealed a compositional analysis of xylose (79.0%), arabinose (5.3%), glucose (1.7%), lignin and ash (5.6%). After neutralization this xylan preparation supported growth of MR44, processing MeGAXn from sweet sorghum and accumulating U-XOS. The quality of U-XOS produced by MR44 using alkaline-treated sweet sorghum bagasse was comparable to that obtained from purified MeGAXn. Overall, the present study demonstrates that direct alkaline treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse is useful to improve the bioavailability of MeGAXn for MR44-mediated conversion to U-XOS with average degrees of polymerization of 11-12, providing alternative resources with applications in nutrition and human and veterinary medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2797485730,"Individual behavioural differences in pet dogs are of great interest from a basic and applied research perspective. Most existing dog personality tests have specific (practical) goals in mind and so focused only on a limited aspect of dogs’ personality, such as identifying problematic (aggressive or fearful) behaviours, assessing suitability as working dogs, or improving the results of adoption. Here we aimed to create a comprehensive test of personality in pet dogs that goes beyond traditional practical evaluations by exposing pet dogs to a range of situations they might encounter in everyday life. The Vienna Dog Personality Test (VIDOPET) consists of 15 subtests and was performed on 217 pet dogs. A two-step data reduction procedure (principal component analysis on each subtest followed by an exploratory factor analysis on the subtest components) yielded five factors: Sociability-obedience, Activity-independence, Novelty seeking, Problem orientation, and Frustration tolerance. A comprehensive evaluation of reliability and validity measures demonstrated excellent inter- and intra-observer reliability and adequate internal consistency of all factors. Moreover the test showed good temporal consistency when re-testing a subsample of dogs after an average of 3.8 years—a considerably longer test-retest interval than assessed for any other dog personality test, to our knowledge. The construct validity of the test was investigated by analysing the correlations between the results of video coding and video rating methods and the owners’ assessment via a dog personality questionnaire. The results demonstrated good convergent as well as discriminant validity. To conclude, the VIDOPET is not only a highly reliable and valid tool for measuring dog personality, but also the first test to show consistent behavioural traits related to problem solving ability and frustration tolerance in pet dogs."

Depending on cellular context, PKCα, PKCδ, and PKC∈, the most commonly expressed PKCs, can trigger mitogenic/tumor-promoting or conversely antimitogenic/tumor suppressor responses (3Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Protein kinase C and other diacylglycerol effectors in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7 (17384583): 281-29410.1038/nrc2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 12Cooke M.

A prediction is that ligands binding to typical C1 domains with differential selectivity could therefore induce distinct patterns of biological response. Although the relevant mechanisms may be uncertain, there are clear examples of C1 domain–targeted ligands inducing distinct patterns of response. Whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is the archetypical mouse skin tumor promoter, prostratin (12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate) was shown to be anti-tumor promoting. Bryostatin 1, a DAG-mimetic macrocyclic polyacetate, activates PKCs in vitro but paradoxically antagonizes many phorbol ester responses. Ingenol 3-angelate only partially stabilizes PKC–membrane interactions. Such diversity of response underlies therapeutic potential. Ingenol 3-angelate (under the trade name PicatoTM) has been approved for treatment of actinic keratosis. Bryostatin 1 has been the subject on numerous clinical trials for cancer and more recently for dementia. Prostratin has been proposed as an agent for conferring sensitivity to drug treatment for cells latently bearing HIV (12Cooke M. Magimaidas A. Casado-Medrano V. Kazanietz M.G.

First, the ligand forms a ternary complex of C1 domain–ligand inserted into the lipid bilayer. The interaction surface of this complex is thus much more extensive than simply that formed between the ligand and the binding cleft of the C1 domain, and there are extensive differences in the surfaces of the typical C1 domains that interact with the lipid headgroups. Second, it is appreciated that different ligands can cause different depths of insertion, changing these interactions. Furthermore, there is considerable diversity between cellular membranes or between microdomains within the membrane, changing the lipid environment with which the interactions will take place (5Kazanietz M.G.

Cyclization of DAGs to rigid lactone structures reduces the entropic penalty associated with the flexibility of the glycerol backbone and provides a scaffold with rich opportunities for decoration at positions homologous to the side chains of DAG. The power of this approach has been shown in the analysis of combinatorial libraries of DAG-lactones where changes in the patterns of acyl and alkyl substitution yielded marked differences in the patterns of biological outcome (24Duan D.

Here, our initial objective was to examine the ability of AJH-836 to bind to recombinant PKCα, PKCβII, PKCδ, and PKC∈ (four of the main phorbol ester–responsive PKCs expressed in cancer cells) under parallel conditions using a competition [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu) binding assay with phosphatidylserine vesicles as cofactor (5Kazanietz M.G.

Under these conditions, AJH-836 preferentially bound the novel PKC isoforms PKC∈ and PKCδ with ∼10–12-fold higher affinity relative to the classical PKC isoforms PKCα and PKCβII (Fig. 1B and Table 1, Table 2).

To tackle this issue, we next examined subcellular translocation of the individual PKC isoforms expressed in cells as GFP-fused proteins. We hypothesized that the differential binding properties observed in vitro for AJH-836 and AJH-1512 could be reflected in characteristic patterns of PKC isozyme translocation in cellular models. Treatment of HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells with AJH-836 fully translocated PKC∈ to the plasma membrane in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The EC50 for this effect was 0.23 μm. Conversely, much higher AJH-836 concentrations were required to induce PKCα plasma membrane translocation (EC50 = 9.8 μm). The ratio EC50 PKCα/EC50 PKC∈ of 43 indicates a notable selectivity for activation of PKC∈ by AJH-836 in this cellular context. Unlike AJH-836, AJH-1512 displayed similar potencies for translocation of these PKCs (EC50 PKCα = 26.1 μm; EC50 PKC∈ = 17.1 μm; ratio EC50 PKCα/EC50 PKC∈ = 1.5) (Fig. 2B), which was consistent with the lack of selectivity observed in in vitro binding assays. As a control, PMA, which potently activates cPKCs and nPKCs, fully translocated both PKCα and PKC∈ to the plasma membrane. Al"
https://openalex.org/W2798142529,"In contrast to theoretical predictions of even adult sex ratios, males are dominating in many bird populations. Such bias among adults may be critical to population growth and viability. Nevertheless, demographic mechanisms for biased adult sex ratios are still poorly understood. Here, we examined potential demographic mechanisms for the recent dramatic shift from a slight female bias among adult eider ducks (Somateria mollissima) to a male bias (about 65% males) in the Baltic Sea, where the species is currently declining. We analysed a nine-year dataset on offspring sex ratio at hatching based on molecularly sexed ducklings of individually known mothers. Moreover, using demographic data from long-term individual-based capture-recapture records, we investigated how sex-specific survival at different ages after fledgling can modify the adult sex ratio. More specifically, we constructed a stochastic two-sex matrix population model and simulated scenarios of different survival probabilities for males and females. We found that sex ratio at hatching was slightly female-biased (52.8%) and therefore unlikely to explain the observed male bias among adult birds. Our stochastic simulations with higher survival for males than for females revealed that despite a slight female bias at hatching, study populations shifted to a male-biased adult sex ratio (> 60% males) in a few decades. This shift was driven by prime reproductive-age individuals (≥5-year-old), with sex-specific survival of younger age classes playing a minor role. Hence, different age classes contributed disproportionally to population dynamics. We argue that an alternative explanation for the observed male dominance among adults–sex-biased dispersal–can be considered redundant and is unlikely, given the ecology of the species. The present study highlights the importance of considering population structure and age-specific vital rates when assessing population dynamics and management targets."
https://openalex.org/W2802709828,"Frailty is a risk factor for disability and mortality, and is more prevalent among African American (AA) elderly than whites. We examine frailty in middle-aged racially and economically diverse adults, and investigate how race, poverty and frailty are associated with mortality. Data were from 2541 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland; 35–64 years old at initial assessment (56% women; 58% AA). Frailty was assessed using a modified FRAIL scale of fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, and compared with difficulties in physical functioning and daily activities. Frailty prevalence was calculated across race and age groups, and associations with survival were assessed by Cox Regression. 278 participants were frail (11%); 924 pre-frail (36%); 1339 not frail (53%). For those aged 45–54, a higher proportion of whites (13%) than AAs (8%) were frail; while the proportions were similar for those 55–64 (14%,16%). Frailty was associated with overall survival with an average follow-up of 6.6 years, independent of race, sex and poverty status (HR = 2.30; 95%CI 1.67–3.18). In this sample of economically and racially diverse older adults, the known association of frailty prevalence and age differed across race with whites having higher prevalence at younger ages. Frailty was associated with survival beyond the risk factors of race and poverty status in this middle-aged group. Early recognition of frailty at these younger ages may provide an effective method for preventing or delaying disabilities."

Here we obtained a slow-motility mutant of L. biflexa MD4-3 by random insertion mutagenesis using a Himar1 transposon. In MD4-3, the gene encoding the flagellar sheath protein, flagellar-coiling protein A (FcpA), which was recently identified in L. interrogans, was inactivated. As with L. interrogans ΔfcpA strains, the L. biflexa ΔfcpA strain lacked a distinct curvature at both ends of the cell body, and its motility was significantly reduced as compared with that of the wild-type strain. PFs isolated from the ΔfcpA strain were straight and were thinner than those isolated from the wild-type strain. Western blot analysis revealed that flagellar proteins FlaA1, FlaA2, FlaB1, and FlaB2 were expressed in the ΔfcpA strain but the flagellar proteins, except for FlaB2 were not incorporated in its PFs. Immunoprecipitation assay using anti-FcpA antiserum demonstrated that FcpA associates with FlaA2 and FlaB1. The association between FcpA and FlaA2 was also verified using pull-down assay. The regions of FlaA2 and FlaB1 interacting with FcpA were determined using a bacterial two-hybrid assay. These results suggest that FcpA together with FlaA2, produces coiling of PF of the Leptospira, and the interaction between the sheath and core filament may be mediated by FcpA and FlaB1."

We investigated demographic and clinical factors associated with unemployment on the example of 150 MS patients receiving immunomodulatory treatment in Poland. This study was based on clinical evaluation and collection of self-reported questionnaires, with an attention to self-motivation, severe fatigue and moderate disability. Patients who were unemployed (40% of all patients) had a mean disease duration of almost 5 years. Older (p<0.001), less educated (p = 0.007) and more severely disabled patients (p<0,001) were most likely to be unemployed. Moderate disability (OR = 11.089 95% CI: 4.11-34.201, p<0,001), severe fatigue (OR = 2.625 95% CI: 1.02-6.901, p = 0,046) and lower level of self-motivation (KNS) (OR = 0.947, 95% CI: 0.896-0.006, p = 0.042) were independently associated with unemployment."
https://openalex.org/W2896760455,"This study aimed to locate the contributing factors of Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE), evaluate their impacts, and try to propose strategies for reducing the possibilities of CHE in the context of China’s current public health insurance system. The financial data of all hospitalization cases from a sample hospital in 2013 were gathered and used to determine the pattern of household medical costs. A simulation model was constructed based on China’s current public health insurance system to evaluate the financial burden for medical service on Chinese patients, as well as to calculate the possibilities of CHE. Then, by adjusting several parameters, suggestions were made for China’s health insurance system in order to reduce CHE. It’s found with China’s current public health insurance system, the financial aid that a patient may receive depends on whether he is from an urban or rural area and whether he is employed. Due to the different insurance policies and the wide income gap between urban and rural areas, rural residents are much more financially vulnerable during health crisis. The possibility of CHE can be more than 50% for low-income rural families. The CHE ratio can be dramatically lowered by applying different policies for different household income groups. It’s concluded the financial burden for medical services of Chinese patients is quite large currently, especially for those from rural areas. By referencing different healthcare policies in the world, applying different health insurance policies for different income groups can dramatically reduce the possibility of CHE in China."

MIMV negative-sense RNA genome sequence of 12,426 nucleotides has recently been completed. Maize Genetics and Genomics database shows that 39,498 coding genes and 4,976 non-coding genes of maize have been determined, but still some transcripts could not be annotated. The molecular host cell responses of maize to MIMV infection including differential gene expression have so far not been elucidated.Complementary DNA libraries were prepared from total RNA of MIMV-infected and mock-inoculated maize leaves and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Cleaned raw transcript reads from MIMV-infected maize were mapped to reads from uninfected maize and to a maize reference genome. Differentially expressed transcripts were characterized by gene ontology and biochemical pathway analyses. Transcriptome data for selected genes were validated by real-time quantitative PCR.Approximately 42 million clean reads for each treatment were obtained. In MIMV-infected maize compared to uninfected plants, 1689 transcripts were up-regulated and 213 transcripts were down-regulated. In response to MIMV infection, several pathways were activated in maize including immune receptor signaling, metabolic pathways, RNA silencing, hormone-mediated pathways, protein degradation, protein kinase and ATP binding activity, and fatty acid metabolism. Also, several transcripts including those encoding hydrophobic protein RCI2B, adenosylmethionine decarboxylase NAC transcription factor and nucleic acid binding, leucine-rich repeat, heat shock protein, 26S proteasome, oxidoreductases and endonuclease activity protein were up-regulated. These data will contribute to the identification of genes and pathways involved in plant-virus interactions that may serve as future targets for improved disease control."
https://openalex.org/W2797388000,"Background In Vietnam, rabies has been a notifiable disease for more than 40 years. Over the last five years, on average, more than 350,000 people per year have been bitten by dogs and cats while more than 80 human deaths have been reported yearly. No studies have been conducted to evaluate the geographical and temporal patterns of rabies in humans in Vietnam. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the geographical and temporal distributions of rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) incidence in humans in Vietnam from 2005 to 2015. Methods Average incidence rabies (AIR) PEP rates for every 3 or 4 years (2005–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–2015) were calculated to describe the spatial distribution of rabies PEP. Hotspot analysis was implemented to identify patterns of spatial significance using the Getis-Ord Gi statistic. For temporal pattern analysis, two regions [Mekong River Delta (MRD) and Southeast Central Coast (SCC)], with the highest incidence rates, and the seasonal-decomposition procedure based on loess (STL), were compared to assess their temporal patterns of rabies PEP. Findings We found hotspots in southern Vietnam and coldspots in northern Vietnam during the study period. Rabies cases were limited to specific areas. In addition, the hotspot analysis showed that new risk areas were identified in each period which were not observed in incidence rate maps. The seasonal plots showed seasonal patterns with a strong peak in February/July and a minor peak in October/December in the MRD region. However, in the SCC, a small peak was detected at the early part of each year and a strong peak in the middle of each year. Conclusion Our findings provide insight into understanding the geographical and seasonal patterns of rabies PEP in Vietnam. This study provides evidence to aid policy makers when making decisions and investing resources. Such information may also be utilized to raise public awareness to prevent rabies exposures and reduce unnecessary PEP."
https://openalex.org/W2606545378,"The regulation of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is important for erythroid survival and differentiation. Lack of iron, a critical component of heme and hemoglobin, activates Heme Regulated Inhibitor (HRI). This results in phosphorylation of eIF2 and reduced eIF2 availability, which inhibits protein synthesis. Translation of specific transcripts such as Atf4, however, is enhanced. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are key to this regulation. The aim of this study is to investigate how tunicamycin treatment, that induces eIF2 phosphorylation, affects mRNA translation in erythroblasts. Ribosome profiling combined with RNA sequencing was used to determine translation initiation sites and ribosome density on individual transcripts. Treatment of erythroblasts with Tunicamycin (Tm) increased phosphorylation of eIF2 2-fold. At a false discovery rate of 1%, ribosome density was increased for 147 transcripts, among which transcriptional regulators such as Atf4, Tis7/Ifrd1, Pnrc2, Gtf2h, Mbd3, JunB and Kmt2e. Translation of 337 transcripts decreased more than average, among which Dym and Csde1. Ribosome profiling following Harringtonine treatment uncovered novel translation initiation sites and uORFs. Surprisingly, translated uORFs did not predict the sensitivity of transcripts to altered ribosome recruitment in presence or absence of Tm. The regulation of transcription and translation factors in reponse to eIF2 phosphorylation may explain the large overall response to iron deficiency in erythroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2797928024,"Bone-to-bone integration can be obtained by osteoconductive ceramics such as hydroxyapatite (HAp) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), but cartilage-to-cartilage integration is notoriously difficult. Many cartilage repair therapies, including microfracture and mosaicplasty, capitalize on the reparative aspects of subchondral bone due to its resident population of stem cells and vascularity. A strategy of incorporating tissue engineered neocartilage into a ceramic to form an osteochondral construct may serve as a suitable alternative to achieve cartilage graft fixation. The use of a tissue engineered osteochondral construct to repair cartilage defects may also benefit from the ceramic’s proximity to underlying bone and abundant supply of progenitor cells and nutrients. The objective of the first study was to compare HAp and β-TCP ceramics, two widely used ceramics in bone regeneration, in terms of their ability to influence neocartilage interdigitation at an engineered osteochondral interface. Additional assays quantified ceramic pore size, porosity, and compressive strength. The compressive strength of HAp was six times higher than that of β-TCP due to differences in porosity and pore size, and HAp was thus carried forward in the second study as the composition with which to engineer an osteochondral construct. Importantly, it was shown that incorporation of the HAp ceramic in conjunction with the self-assembling process resulted in functionally viable neocartilage. For example, only collagen/dry weight and ultimate tensile strength of the chondral control constructs remained significantly greater than the neocartilage cut off the osteochondral constructs. By demonstrating that the functional properties of engineered neocartilage are not negatively affected by the inclusion of an HAp ceramic in culture, neocartilage engineering strategies may be directly applied to the formation of an osteochondral construct."
https://openalex.org/W2798019761,"A central step in the pathogenesis of prion diseases is the conformational transition of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the scrapie isoform, denoted PrPSc. Studies in transgenic mice have indicated that this conversion requires a direct interaction between PrPC and PrPSc; however, insights into the underlying mechanisms are still missing. Interestingly, only a subfraction of PrPC is converted in scrapie-infected cells, suggesting that not all PrPC species are suitable substrates for the conversion. On the basis of the observation that PrPC can form homodimers under physiological conditions with the internal hydrophobic domain (HD) serving as a putative dimerization domain, we wondered whether PrP dimerization is involved in the formation of neurotoxic and/or infectious PrP conformers. Here, we analyzed the possible impact on dimerization of pathogenic mutations in the HD that induce a spontaneous neurodegenerative disease in transgenic mice. Similarly to wildtype (WT) PrPC, the neurotoxic variant PrP(AV3) formed homodimers as well as heterodimers with WTPrPC. Notably, forced PrP dimerization via an intermolecular disulfide bond did not interfere with its maturation and intracellular trafficking. Covalently linked PrP dimers were complex glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and sorted to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, forced PrPC dimerization completely blocked its conversion into PrPSc in chronically scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, PrPC dimers had a dominant-negative inhibition effect on the conversion of monomeric PrPC. Our findings suggest that PrPC monomers are the major substrates for PrPSc propagation and that it may be possible to halt prion formation by stabilizing PrPC dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2897540783,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a liver disorder that can result in cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV infection remains a major global health problem, as it affects more 350 million people chronically and kills roughly 600,000 people annually. Drugs currently used against HBV include IFN-α that decreases viremia, inflammation and the growth of liver fibrosis, and adefovir that decreases the viral load. Each of these drugs can have severe side-effects. In the present paper, we consider the treatment of chronic HBV by a combination of IFN-α and adefovir, and raise the following question: What should be the optimal ratio between IFN-α and adefovir in order to achieve the best ‘efficacy’ under constraints on the total amount of the drugs; here the efficacy is measured by the reduction of the levels of inflammation and of fibrosis? We develop a mathematical model of HBV pathogenesis by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) and use the model to simulate a ‘synergy map’ which addresses the above question."
https://openalex.org/W2797558400,"Although personality traits can largely affect individual fitness we know little about the evolutionary forces generating and maintaining personality variation. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that personality variation in aggression is sexually selected in the monogamous, bi-parental cichlid Pelvicachromis pulcher. In this species, breeding pairs form territories and they aggressively defend their territory and offspring against con- and heterospecific intruders. In our mate choice study, we followed up two alternative hypotheses. We either expected females to show a directional preference for a high level and high consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for male parental quality). Alternatively, we expected females to choose males for (dis-)similarity in the level/consistency of aggression (potentially indicating mate choice for compatibility). Individual level and consistency of aggression were assessed for males and females using mirror tests. After eavesdropping on aggressive behaviour of two males (differing in level and consistency of aggression) females were then allowed to choose between the two males. Males, but not females, showed personality variation in aggression. Further, females generally preferred consistent over inconsistent males independent of their level of aggression. We did not detect a general preference for the level of male aggression. However, we found an above average preference for consistent high-aggression males; whereas female preference for inconsistent high-aggression did not deviate from random choice. Our results suggest behavioural consistency of aggression in male rainbow kribs is selected for via female mate choice. Further, our study underlines the importance of considering both the level and the consistency of a behavioural trait in studies of animal behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2897947831,"Hepatitis C is the second fastest growing infectious disease in China. The standard-of-care for chronic hepatitis C in China is Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PR), which is associated with tolerability and efficacy issues. An interferon- and ribavirin-free, all-oral regimen comprising daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV), which displays higher efficacy and tolerability, has recently been approved in China.This study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DCV+ASV (24 weeks) for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b treatment-naïve patients compared with PR regimen (48 weeks) in China.A cohort-based Markov model was developed from Chinese payer perspective to project the lifetime outcomes of treating 10,000 patients with an average age of 44.5 with two hypothetical regimens, DCV+ASV and PR. Chinese-specific health state costs and efficacy data were used. The annual discount rate was 5%. Base-case analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted.For HCV Genotype 1b treatment-naïve patients, DCV+ASV proved to be dominant over PR, with a cost saving of ¥33,480(5,096 USD) and gains in QALYs and life years of 1.29 and 0.85, respectively. The lifetime risk of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death was greatly reduced with DCV+ASV. Univariate sensitivity analysis demonstrated that key influencers were the discount rate, time horizon, initial disease severity and sustained virological response rate of DCV+ASV, with all scenarios resulting in additional benefit. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that DCV+ASV has a high likelihood (100%) of being cost-effective.DCV+ASV is not only an effective and well-tolerated regimen to treat chronic HCV genotype 1b infection treatment-naïve patients, but also is more cost-effective than PR regimen. DCV+ASV can benefit both the public health and reimbursement system in China."
https://openalex.org/W2796904940,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly regarded as a key role in regulating diverse biological processes in various tissues and species. Although the cold responsive lncRNAs have been reported in plants, no data is available on screening and functional prediction of lncRNAs in cold acclimation in fish so far. Here we compared the expression profile of lncRNAs in cold acclimated zebrafish embryonic fibroblast cells (ZF4) cultured at 18°C for 30 days with that of cells cultured at 28°C as control by high-throughput sequencing. Totally 8,363 novel lncRNAs were identified. Including known and novel lncRNAs, there are 347 lncRNAs up-regulated and 342 lncRNAs down-regulated in cold acclimated cells. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, 74 and 61 were detected only in control cells or cold-acclimated cells, respectively. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of adjacent genes to the differentially expressed lncRNAs showed that the enriched genes are involved in electron transport, cell adhesion, oxidation-reduction process, and so on. We also predicted the target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs by looking for interactions between lncRNAs and mRNAs, and constructed an interaction network. In summary, our genome-wide systematic identification and functional prediction of cold responsive lncRNAs in zebrafish cells suggests a crucial role of lincRNAs in cold acclimation in fish."
https://openalex.org/W2797865934,"Our study addresses how environmental variables, such as macronutrients concentrations, snow cover, carbonate chemistry and salinity affect the photophysiology and biomass of Antarctic sea-ice algae. We have measured vertical profiles of inorganic macronutrients (phosphate, nitrite + nitrate and silicic acid) in summer sea ice and photophysiology of ice algal assemblages in the poorly studied Amundsen and Ross Seas sectors of the Southern Ocean. Brine-scaled bacterial abundance, chl a and macronutrient concentrations were often high in the ice and positively correlated with each other. Analysis of photosystem II rapid light curves showed that microalgal cells in samples with high phosphate and nitrite + nitrate concentrations had reduced maximum relative electron transport rate and photosynthetic efficiency. We also observed strong couplings of PSII parameters to snow depth, ice thickness and brine salinity, which highlights a wide range of photoacclimation in Antarctic pack-ice algae. It is likely that the pack ice was in a post-bloom situation during the late sea-ice season, with low photosynthetic efficiency and a high degree of nutrient accumulation occurring in the ice. In order to predict how key biogeochemical processes are affected by future changes in sea ice cover, such as in situ photosynthesis and nutrient cycling, we need to understand how physicochemical properties of sea ice affect the microbial community. Our results support existing hypothesis about sea-ice algal photophysiology, and provide additional observations on high nutrient concentrations in sea ice that could influence the planktonic communities as the ice is retreating."
https://openalex.org/W2799813956,"Chlamydia trachomatis infects the urogenital tract (UGT) and eyes. Anatomical tropism is correlated with variation in the major outer membrane protein encoded by ompA. Strains possessing the ocular ompA variants A, B, Ba and C are typically found within the phylogenetically coherent “classical ocular lineage”. However, variants B, Ba and C have also been found within three distinct strains in Australia, all associated with ocular disease in children and outside the classical ocular lineage. CtGEM genotyping is a method for detecting and discriminating ocular strains and also the major phylogenetic lineages. The rationale was facilitation of surveillance to inform responses to C. trachomatis detection in UGT specimens from young children. CtGEM typing is based on high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) of two PCR amplified fragments with high combinatorial resolving power, as defined by computerised comparison of 65 whole genomes. One fragment is from the hypothetical gene defined by Jali-1891 in the C. trachomatis B_Jali20 genome, while the other is from ompA. Twenty combinatorial CtGEM types have been shown to exist, and these encompass unique genotypes for all known ocular strains, and also delineate the TI and T2 major phylogenetic lineages, identify LGV strains and provide additional resolution beyond this. CtGEM typing and Sanger sequencing were compared with 42 C. trachomatis positive clinical specimens, and there were no disjunctions. CtGEM typing is a highly efficient method designed and tested using large scale comparative genomics. It divides C. trachomatis into clinically and biologically meaningful groups, and may have broad application in surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2798010895,"Brain phenotypes showing environmental influence may help clarify unexplained associations between urban exposure and psychiatric risk. Heritable prefrontal fMRI activation during working memory (WM) is such a phenotype. We hypothesized that urban upbringing (childhood urbanicity) would alter this phenotype and interact with dopamine genes that regulate prefrontal function during WM. Further, dopamine has been hypothesized to mediate urban-associated factors like social stress. WM-related prefrontal function was tested for main effects of urbanicity, main effects of three dopamine genes—catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)—and, importantly, dopamine gene-by-urbanicity interactions. For COMT, three independent human samples were recruited (total n = 487). We also studied 253 subjects genotyped for DRD1 and DRD2. 3T fMRI activation during the N-back WM task was the dependent variable, while childhood urbanicity, dopamine genotype, and urbanicity-dopamine interactions were independent variables. Main effects of dopamine genes and of urbanicity were found. Individuals raised in an urban environment showed altered prefrontal activation relative to those raised in rural or town settings. For each gene, dopamine genotype-by-urbanicity interactions were shown in prefrontal cortex–COMT replicated twice in two independent samples. An urban childhood upbringing altered prefrontal function and interacted with each gene to alter genotype-phenotype relationships. Gene-environment interactions between multiple dopamine genes and urban upbringing suggest that neural effects of developmental environmental exposure could mediate, at least partially, increased risk for psychiatric illness in urban environments via dopamine genes expressed into adulthood."

Study participants were 258 infants from singleton pregnancies enrolled in the Hamamatsu Birth Cohort for Mothers and Children (HBC Study) whose placentas were stored in our pathological division. They were followed up from birth to 18 months of age. Physiological development (body weight and the ponderal index [PI]) was assessed at 0, 1, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 18 months. Placental blocks were prepared by random sampling and eleven pathological findings were assessed, as follows: ‘Accelerated villous maturation’, ‘Decidual vasculopathy’, ‘Thrombosis or Intramural fibrin deposition’, ‘Avascular villi’, ‘Delayed villous maturation’, ‘Maternal inflammatory response’, ‘Fetal inflammatory response’, ‘Villitis of unknown etiology (VUE)’, ‘Deciduitis’, ‘Maternal vascular malperfusion’, and ‘Fetal vascular malperfusion’. Mixed model analysis with the use of the xtmixed command by the generic statistical software, Stata version 13.1., identified ‘Accelerated villous maturation’ and ‘Maternal vascular malperfusion’ as significant predictors of a lower body weight and ‘Deciduitis’ as a significant predictor of a small PI, throughout the first 18 months of life. In conclusion, the present study is the first to demonstrate that some pathological findings of the placenta are associated with changes in infantile physical development during the initial 18 months of life in the Japanese population."

As for the chemical profile, the antioxidant activity was performed by spectrophotometry, and the profile of carotenoids and amino acids by chromatography. Our data demonstrated that A. phalerata oil has high carotenoid content, antioxidant activity and the presence of 5 essential amino acids. In the in vitro models of inflammation, the oil demonstrated the capacity to inhibit COX1 and COX2 enzymes, the production of nitric oxide and also induces macrophages to spreading. In the in vivo models of inflammation, the oil inhibited edema and leukocyte migration in the Wistar rats. In the in vitro model of antiproliferative and cytoprotective activity, the oil was shown inactive against the kidney carcinoma and prostate carcinoma lineage cells and with cytoprotective capacity in murine fibroblast cells, inhibiting the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin. Therefore, it is concluded that A. phalerata pulp oil has anti-inflammatory effects with nutraceutical properties potential due to the rich composition. Moreover, the oil also has cytoprotective activity probably because of its ability to inhibit the action of free radicals."
https://openalex.org/W2796650250,"The aim of this study is to disclose the potential bioactive components of Cuscuta palaestina, a native parasitic natural plant of flora palaestina and to open direction towards new prospective application. GC-MS analysis identified 18 components in the methanolic extract of C. palaestina for the first time. The most appealing among them are Sesamin and two other phytosterols (Campesterol and Stigmasterol), all of which are documented in the scientific literature for their anticancer activity. Quantitation of Sesamin extracted from C. palaestina by HPLC-PDA with the use of three organic solvents showed that the Sesamin content in the methanolic extract was the highest. Following the disclosure of Sesamin presence in C. palaestina, we raised the question of whether it is produced naturally in C. palaestina or acquired from the host plant. The quantitation of Sesamin in C. palaestina was performed while being with five different host plants, and was compared with the amount of Sesamin in C. palaestina grown alone. The findings reveal that Sesamin is an endogenous secondary metabolite in C. palaestina. Thus, further studies are required to prove if C. palaestina can be used as an alternative source of anticancer phytochemicals, mainly Sesamin, and if proteins in the Sesamin production pathway could be valid biological targets for the development of novel and selective pesticides for control/ eradication of C. palaestina and maybe some other Cuscuta species. As well, the findings from this study raise a big question of whether inferring Sesamin production in C. palaestina could reduce its attack ability to host plants."
https://openalex.org/W2796801431,"Many signaling pathways that control cellular development, cell-cycle progression and nutritional versatility have been studied in Caulobacter crescentus. For example, it was suggested that the response regulator NtrX is conditionally essential for this bacterium and that it might be necessary for responding to a signal produced in phosphate-replete minimal medium. However, such signal has not been identified yet and the role of NtrX in C. crescentus biology remains elusive. Here, using wild-type C. crescentus and a strain with a chromosomally myc-tagged ntrX gene, we demonstrate that high concentrations of phosphate (10 mM) regulate ntrX transcription and the abundance of the protein. We also show that the pH of the medium acts as a switch able to regulate the phosphorylation status of NtrX, promoting its phosphorylation under mildly acidic conditions and its dephosphorylation at neutral pH. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ntrX gene is required for survival in environments with low pH and under acidic stress. Finally, we prove that NtrX phosphorylation is also triggered by low pH in Brucella abortus, a pathogenic alphaproteobacterium. Overall, our work contributes to deepen the general knowledge of this system and provides tools to elucidate the NtrX regulon."

However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D < 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium."

The primary objective of this study was to determine the fine-scale spatial distribution of different genospecies in four rodent species, the California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi), northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes), and Allen’s chipmunk (Neotamias senex). Rodents were live-trapped between June 2004 and May 2005 at the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation (HVTR) in Humboldt County, California. Ear-punch biopsies obtained from each rodent were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The programs ArcGIS and SaTScan were used to examine the spatial distribution of genospecies. Multinomial log-linear models were used to model habitat and host-specific characteristics and their effect on the presence of each borrelial genospecies. The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models and determine model fit. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was primarily associated with chipmunks and B. bissettiae largely with woodrats. The top model included the variables “host species”, “month”, and “elevation” (weight = 0.84). Spatial clustering of B. bissettiae was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation."
https://openalex.org/W2810421038,"Background In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis seems to be linked to autonomic dysfunction. This study investigates the role of autonomic dysfunction assessed by Heart Rate Turbulence (HRT) analyses in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods and patients Inclusion criteria was (1) diagnosis of cirrhosis by clinical, imaging or biopsy and (2) evaluation by standard 12-lead-ECG and 24h holter monitoring and (3) at least 3 premature ventricular contractions. The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis. Results Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03). Nevertheless, at least in our collective HRT-parameters were not independent predictors of deterioration of cirrhosis. Conclusion Parameters of HRT are closely associated with deterioration of cirrhosis and might be helpful in its prediction."

One-hundred-and-two 5- to 12-year-old children and twenty-three adults performed a sequential same/different face matching task, where they viewed an Asian- or a Caucasian-parent face followed by either the same parent face or a different morphed face (containing 15%, 30%, 45%, or 60% contribution from the other parent face) and judged if the two faces looked the same. We computed the d’ as the sensitivity index for each age groups. We also analyzed the group mean rejection rates as a function of the morph level and fitted with a cumulative normal distribution function. Results showed that the adults and the oldest 11-12-year-old children exhibited a greater sensitivity (d’) and a smaller discrimination threshold (μ) in the Asian-parent condition than those in the Caucasian-parent condition, indicating the presence of an own-race advantage. On the contrary, 5- to 10-year-old children showed an equal sensitivity and similar discrimination thresholds for both conditions, indicating an absence of the own-race advantage. Moreover, a gradual development in enhancing the discriminability for the Asian-parent condition was observed from age 5 to 12; however, the progression in the Caucasian-parent condition was less apparent. In sum, our findings suggest that expertise in face processing may take the entire childhood to develop, and supports the perceptual learning view of the other-race effect—the own-race advantage seen in adulthood likely reflects a result of prolonged learning specific to faces most commonly seen in one’s visual environment such as own-race faces."
https://openalex.org/W2797938021,"Reduced postural control is thought to contribute to the development and persistence of chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP). It is therefore frequently assessed in affected patients and commonly reported as the average amount of postural sway while standing upright under a variety of sensory conditions. These averaged linear outcomes, such as mean centre of pressure (CP) displacement or mean CP surface areas, may not reflect the true postural status. Adding nonlinear outcomes and multi-segmental kinematic analysis has been reported to better reflect the complexity of postural control and may detect subtler postural differences. In this cross-sectional study, a combination of linear and nonlinear postural parameters were assessed in patients with CNLBP (n = 24, 24-75 years, 9 females) and compared to symptom-free controls (CG, n = 34, 22-67 years, 11 females). Primary outcome was postural control measured by variance of joint configurations (uncontrolled manifold index, UI), confidence ellipse surface areas (CEA) and approximate entropy (ApEn) of CP dispersion during the response phase of a perturbed postural control task on a swaying platform. Secondary outcomes were segment excursions and clinical outcome correlates for pain and function. Non-parametric tests for group comparison with P-adjustment for multiple comparisons were conducted. Principal component analysis was applied to identify patterns of segmental contribution in both groups. CNLBP and CG performed similarly with respect to the primary outcomes. Comparison of joint kinematics revealed significant differences of hip (P < .001) and neck (P < .025) angular excursion, representing medium to large group effects (r′s = .36 − .51). Significant (P′s < .05), but moderate correlations of ApEn (r = -.42) and UI (r = -.46) with the health-related outcomes were observed. These findings lend further support to the notion that averaged linear outcomes do not suffice to describe subtle postural differences in CNLBP patients with low to moderate pain status."
https://openalex.org/W2798167283,"Pteropus (flying-foxes) are a speciose group of non-echolocating large bats, with five extant Australian species and 24 additional species distributed amongst the Pacific Islands. In 2015, an injured flying-fox with unusual facial markings was found in Sydney, Australia, following severe and widespread storms. Based on an initial assessment, the individual belonged to Pteropus but could not be readily identified to species. As a consequence, four hypotheses for its identification/origin were posited: the specimen represented (1) an undescribed Australian species; or (2) a morphological variant of a recognised Australian species; or (3) a hybrid individual; or (4) a vagrant from the nearby Southwest Pacific Islands. We used a combination of morphological and both mitochondrial- and nuclear DNA-based identification methods to assess these hypotheses. Based on the results, we propose that this morphologically unique Pteropus most likely represents an unusual P. alecto (black flying-fox) potentially resulting from introgression from another Pteropus species. Unexpectedly, this individual, and the addition of reference sequence data from newly vouchered specimens, revealed a previously unreported P. alecto mitochondrial DNA lineage. This lineage was distinct from currently available haplotypes. It also suggests long-term hybridisation commonly occurs between P. alecto and P. conspicillatus (spectacled flying-fox). This highlights the importance of extensive reference data, and the inclusion of multiple vouchered specimens for each species to encompass both intraspecific and interspecific variation to provide accurate and robust species identification. Moreover, our additional reference data further demonstrates the complexity of Pteropus species relationships, including hybridisation, and potential intraspecific biogeographical structure that may impact on their management and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2896223261,"The dried stigmas of Crocus sativus constitute the saffron, which is considered to be the costliest spice of the world. Saffron is valuable for its constituents, which are mainly apocarotenoids. In order to enhance the production of apocarotenoids, it is imperative to understand the regulation of apocarotenoid biosynthetic pathway. In C. sativus, although the pathway has been elucidated, the information regarding the regulation of the pathwaygenes is scanty. During the present investigation, the characterization of promoters regulating the expression of two important genes i.e. CsPSY and CsUGT was performed. We successfully cloned the promoters of both the genes, which were functionally characterized in Crocus sativus and Nicotiana tabaccum. In silico analysis of the promoters demonstrated the presence of several important cis regulatory elements responding tolight, hormonesand interaction with transcription factors (TFs). Further analysis suggested the regulation of CsPSY promoter by Abscisic acid (ABA) and that of CsUGT by Gibberellic acid (GA). In addition, we also observed ABA and GA mediated modulation in the expression of significant TFs and CsPSY and CsUGT transcripts. Overall, the study addresses issues related to regulation of key genes of apocarotenoid pathway in C.sativus."
https://openalex.org/W2796873428,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products contain various amounts of dimeric IgG complexes. Current insights into the possible biological activities of these dimers remain controversial, and both immunemodulating and immune-activating effects have been reported. Here, we analyzed the putative immune-activating effects of dimers isolated from IVIg.Dimers isolated from IVIg were purified by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) and tested for the ability to induce neutrophil degranulation in vitro.Dimers isolated from IVIg were found to be incapable of inducing in vitro neutrophil degranulation or complement activation, even at concentrations exceeding those expected to be reached upon administration in patients. These results depend on the removal of artefactual activation by using 0.1 micron filtration and the use of poloxamer to prevent adsorption of IgG onto the solid phase.The data suggest dimeric IgG found in IVIg may bind to Fc-receptors without causing activation."
https://openalex.org/W2796946308,"The model single-stranded DNA binding protein of bacteriophage T4, gene 32 protein (gp32) has well-established roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. gp32 is a single-chain polypeptide consisting of three domains. Based on thermodynamics and kinetics measurements, we have proposed that gp32 can undergo a conformational change where the acidic C-terminal domain binds internally to or near the single-stranded (ss) DNA binding surface in the core (central) domain, blocking ssDNA interaction. To test this model, we have employed a variety of experimental approaches and gp32 variants to characterize this conformational change. Utilizing stopped-flow methods, the association kinetics of wild type and truncated forms of gp32 with ssDNA were measured. When the C-domain is present, the log-log plot of k vs. [NaCl] shows a positive slope, whereas when it is absent (*I protein), there is little rate change with salt concentration, as expected for this model.A gp32 variant lacking residues 292–296 within the C-domain, ΔPR201, displays kinetic properties intermediate between gp32 and *I. The single molecule force-induced DNA helix-destabilizing activitiesas well as the single- and double-stranded DNA affinities of ΔPR201 and gp32 truncated at residue 295 also fall between full-length protein and *I. Finally, chemical cross-linking of recombinant C-domain and gp32 lacking both N- and C-terminal domains is inhibited by increasing concentrations of a short single-stranded oligonucleotide, and the salt dependence of cross-linking mirrors that expected for the model. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence in support of this model that have been obtained through structural probes."
https://openalex.org/W2797203440,"To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products. Our findings contribute to understand degradation mechanisms of TB and may elucidate previous clinical and experimental observations of cellular toxicity after TB application."

This paper used orthogonal method and variance analysis to make significant analysis on the factors which would affect the thermodynamics characteristics of the SC-CCES system and obtained the significant factors and interactions in the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage system. Results have shown that the interactions in the components have little influence on the energy-storage process, the energy-release process and the whole energy-storage process of the SC-CCES system, the significant factors are mainly on the characteristics of the system component itself, which will provide reference for the optimization of the thermal properties of the energy-storage system."
https://openalex.org/W2802457026,"Mosquitoes that have been genetically engineered for resistance to human pathogens are a potential new tool for controlling vector-borne disease. However, genetic modification may have unintended off-target effects that could affect the mosquitoes’ utility for disease control. We measured the resistance of five genetically modified Plasmodium-suppressing Anopheles stephensi lines to o’nyong’nyong virus, four classes of insecticides, and diverse Plasmodium falciparum field isolates and characterized the interactions between our genetic modifications and infection with the bacterium Wolbachia. The genetic modifications did not alter the mosquitoes’ resistance to either o’nyong’nyong virus or insecticides, and the mosquitoes were equally resistant to all tested P. falciparum strains, regardless of Wolbachia infection status. These results indicate that mosquitoes can be genetically modified for resistance to malaria parasite infection and remain compatible with other vector-control measures without becoming better vectors for other pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2800814226,"LdtR is a master regulator of gene expression in Liberibacter asiaticus, one of the causative agents of citrus greening disease. LdtR belongs to the MarR-family of transcriptional regulators and it has been linked to the regulation of more than 180 genes in Liberibacter species, most of them gathered in the following Clusters of Orthologous Groups: cell motility, cell wall envelope, energy production, and transcription. Our previous transcriptomic evidence suggested that LdtR is directly involved in the modulation of the zinc uptake system genes (znu) in the closely related L. crescens. In this report, we show that LdtR is involved in the regulation of one of the two encoded zinc uptake mechanisms in L. asiaticus, named znu2. We also show that LdtR binds zinc with higher affinity than benzbromarone, a synthetic effector inhibitory molecule, resulting in the disruption of the LdtR:promoter interactions. Using site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and isothermal titration calorimetry, we identified that residues C28 and T43 in LdtR, located in close proximity to the Benz1 pocket, are involved in the interaction with zinc. These results provided new evidence of a high-affinity effector molecule targeting a key player in L. asiaticus' physiology and complemented our previous findings about the mechanisms of signal transduction in members of the MarR-family."
https://openalex.org/W2797346575,"Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based high-performance accelerometers are ubiquitously used in various electronic devices. However, there is an existing need to detect physical impacts using low-cost devices with no electronic circuits or a battery. We designed and fabricated an impact sensor prototype using a commercial stereolithography apparatus that only consists of a plastic housing and working fluids. The sensor device responds to the instantaneous acceleration (impact) by deformation and pinch off of a water droplet that is suspended in oil in a sensor cavity. We tested the various geometrical and physical parameters of the impact sensor to identify their relations to threshold acceleration values. We show that the state diagram that is plotted against the dimensionless Archimedes and Bond numbers adequately describes the response of the proposed sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2798046201,"A coproduction tests of quaternary (Q) phase(6CaO·4Al2O3·MgO·SiO2) -3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 cement clinker and an experimental study on the relationship between the mineral production capability and the physiochemical properties are conducted in a two-stage multiphase reaction test bed with Changguang coal. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analyses are performed on the coproduction clinker samples. The results demonstrate that, with the reduction in particle sizes of the coal powder and the additives and expanded screening level differences between them, both the proportion of Q phase and the mass of 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 in the clinker increase accordingly. When mixed coal powder particles are prepared through reducing particle sizes and expanding screening level differences between coal powder and additives, the additives CaO and MgO are more likely to be enclosed by coal powder to form globular polymerized particles. In addition, this preparation aids in polymerization and promotes even distribution of CaO, MgO and coal minerals, thus facilitating clinker mineral formation reactions of inorganic substances in the mixed coal powder. Target minerals, such as 2CaO·SiO2 and Q phase, are found in both industrial high-calcium limestone and low-calcium limestone coproduction clinker samples. A diffraction peak of free CaO is also evident in both samples. Compared with a coproduction clinker sample of high-calcium limestone, that of low-calcium limestone exhibits higher diffraction peaks for 2CaO·SiO2 and Q phase. With the current state of the art, it is not yet the optimum choice to substitute CaCO3 for CaO in Q-phase cement clinker coproduction. Before the technology matures and gains practical application, further study on the form and the mixing process of calcium-based additives for cement clinker coproduction will be required."
