Glycemic control and psychological wellbeing of the patient is mandatory for diabetes management. Addressing these issues in the early stages of the disease are the best interventions for decreasing poor glycemic control and psychological problems. Objective To explore and analyze the literature for evidence of the effect of Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention has on glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HgbA1C) and depression in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods A systemic review and meta-analysis of studies published in Cochrane Library, Google scholar, PubMed, & clinical trials.gov between 01/01/2009 and 12/06/2020 was performed. Inclusion criteria included RCT and pre post studies that assessed the effects of Motivational Interviewing on Hgb.A1C and depression in adults with T2DM. Weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous data. The data were synthesized and analyzed in a narrative form in systematic review and meta-analysis which was conducted using RevMan 5.2.0 & STATA version 11 software. Data were evaluated by weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs. Result Of the total identified 121 studies, eight were eligible for inclusion in the review. The pooled results showed that MI resulted in a significant improvement of mean HgbA1C level in the intervention group when compared with the control group (WMD, -0.29; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.10; p = 0.003, I-2 = 48%). Effect of MI intervention on depressive symptoms was identified through subgroup analysis according to intervention session time (30 or 60-80 minutes) and Follow-up period (3 or 24 months) then result showed that there was no significant difference in the reduction of depressive symptoms between the intervention and control groups. The output results were (WMD, -1.58; 95% CI, -5.05 to -0.188; p = 0.37; I-2 = 48%), (WMD, -4.30; 95% CI, -9.32 to -0.73; p = 0.09; I-2 = 95%), (WMD, -4.45; 95% CI, -10.58 to 1.69; p = 0.16; I-2 = 96%) and (WMD, -2.12; 95% CI, -5.54 to 1.30; p = 0.22; I-2 = 83%) respectively. Conclusion The pooled result in meta-analysis indicated that motivational interviewing is effective in reducing HgbA1C but not depressive symptoms of patients with type 2 diabetes. Motivational interviewing intervention is important for diabetes management and effective in glycemic control with no effect on the reduction of depressive symptoms among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

A randomized controlled trial	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; S-100 PROTEIN MEASUREMENTS; NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; SERUM-LEVELS; BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; TISSUE DAMAGE; ELITE PLAYERS; ICE HOCKEY; BIOMARKERS	The purpose of this study was to test the effect of subconcussive head impacts on acute changes in plasma S100B. In this randomized controlled trial, 79 healthy adult soccer players were randomly assigned to either the heading (n = 41) or kicking-control groups (n = 38). The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a speed of 25 mph, whereas the kicking-control group performed 10 kicks. Plasma samples were obtained at pre-, 0h post-, 2h post- and 24h post-intervention and measured for S100B. The primary hypothesis was that there would be a significant group difference (group-by-time interaction) in plasma S100B at 2h post-intervention. Secondary hypotheses included (1) no significant group differences in plasma S100B concentrations at 0h post- and 24h post-intervention; (2) a significant within-group increase in S100B concentrations in the heading group at 2h post-intervention compared to pre-intervention; and (3) no significant within-group changes in plasma S100B in the kicking-control group. Data from 68 subjects were available for analysis (heading n = 37, kicking n = 31). There were no differences in S100B concentrations between heading and kicking groups over time, as evidenced by nonsignificant group-by-time interaction at 2h post-intervention (B = 2.20, 95%CI [-22.22, 26.63], p = 0.86) and at all the other time points (0h post: B = -11.05, 95%CI [-35.37, 13.28], p = 0.38; 24h post: B = 16.11, 95%CI [-8.29, 40.51], p = 0.20). Part of the secondary outcome, the heading group showed elevation in plasma S100B concentrations at 24h post-intervention compared to pre-heading baseline (B = 19.57, 95%CI [3.13, 36.02], p = 0.02), whereas all other within-group comparisons in both remained nonsignificant. The data suggest that 10 bouts of acute controlled soccer headings do not elevate S100B concentrations up to 24-hour post-heading. Further dose-response studies with longer follow-up time points may help determine thresholds of acute soccer heading exposure that are related to astrocyte activation. The protocol was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (; retrospectively registered.).

Methods Eight databases, PubMed, GWAS, Embase, Lochrane, Ebsco, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP (Viper Database) and ChinaInfo were searched, and a meta-analysis of susceptibility was conducted between SNP45, SNP276 polymorphisms and T2DM. Furthermore, HWE test was conducted to assess the genetic balance of the study, evaluate the quality of Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS), and establishing allelic, dominant, recessive, heterozygous, and homozygous gene models. Results This meta-analysis included 53 articles, encompassing 9285 cases with rs2241766 and 14156 controls and 7747 cases with rs1501299 and 10607 controls. For the rs2241766 locus, a significant correlation was found in the three models by the subgroup analysis. Western Asians: dominant gene model (TT + TG vs. GG, P = 0.01); heterozygous gene model (TG vs. GG, P = 0.02); homozygous gene model (TT vs. GG, P = 0.01). South Asians: dominant gene model (TT + TG vs. GG, P = 0.004); heterozygous gene model (TG vs. GG, P = 0.009); homozygous gene model (TT vs. GG, P = 0.005). However, no statistically significant correlation was established among the five genetic models for rs1501299 locus. Conclusion The findings of the present study indicated that the T allele of rs2241766 polymorphism is the susceptibility locus of T2DM in the West Asian population, but has a protective effect in the South Asian population, albeit further studies are needed in other populations. Also, no association was found between theADIPOQrs1501299 polymorphism and T2DM.

J	Dumas, D; Doherty, M; Organisciak, P				Dumas, Denis; Doherty, Michael; Organisciak, Peter			The psychology of professional and student actors: Creativity, personality, and motivation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIVERGENT THINKING TESTS; EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE; BETWEEN-GROUPS; EXPERTISE; MEMORY; ORIGINALITY; PERFORMANCE; REGRESSION; SAMPLE	As a profession, acting is marked by a high-level of economic and social riskiness concomitantly with the possibility for artistic satisfaction and/or public admiration. Current understanding of the psychological attributes that distinguish professional actors is incomplete. Here, we compare samples of professional actors (n = 104), undergraduate student actors (n = 100), and non-acting adults (n = 92) on 26 psychological dimensions and use machine-learning methods to classify participants based on these attributes. Nearly all of the attributes measured here displayed significant univariate mean differences across the three groups, with the strongest effect sizes being on Creative Activities, Openness, and Extraversion. A cross-validated Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) classification model was capable of identifying actors (either professional or student) from nonactors with a 92% accuracy and was able to sort professional from student actors with a 96% accuracy when age was included in the model, and a 68% accuracy with only psychological attributes included. In these LASSO models, actors in general were distinguished by high levels of Openness, Assertiveness, and Elaboration, but professional actors were specifically marked by high levels of Originality, Volatility, and Literary Activities.

Epidemiological data from hard to reach areas will help to identify high-risk communities for targeted intervention. We, therefore, assessed the magnitude of intestinal parasites among Zay people residing in three islands of Lake Ziway in Ethiopia. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted in March 2013 on 444 individuals aged 6 months to 85 years. Stool samples were analyzed using wet mount and formol-ether concentration methods. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using STATA version 10. Results Among the study participants, 52% (321/444) were children under 15 years. While 72.8% were positive for at least one intestinal parasite, single, dual and triple infections were found in 42.1%, 23.9% and 6.3%, respectively. Four types of intestinal parasites were detected in two children. The commonest parasites wereEntamoeba histolytica/dispar(51.4%),Schistosoma mansoni(17.8%),Giardia lamblia(14.4%),Trichuris trichiura(10.8%), Taenia species (5.6%),Hymenolopis nana(4.5%),Ascaris lumbricoides(4.1%),Entrobius vermicularis(0.9%), Hookworm (0.7%), andStrongyloides stercoralis(0.2%). Remarkable proportion of study participants (51.3%) had no latrine and >85% of the islanders use the lake water for drinking, cleaning or both. About 36% had no information about waterborne and related diseases, while 31% never heard about bilharziasis. Fishing and farming were the main source of income. In the multivariate model, being in the age group > 15 years (AOR = 0.49; 95%CI = 0.28-0.85) and not using lake water for drinking or washing (AOR = 0.52; 95%CI = 0.28-0.99) had protective effect, after adjusting for education, occupation and hand wash after latrine use. Conclusion The observed high rate of intestinal parasites (72.8%) in these hard to reach Islanders of Lake Ziway, warrants targeted and sustainable intervention.

J	Holst-Hansen, JA; Bergenholtz, C				Holst-Hansen, Joachim A.; Bergenholtz, Carsten			Does the size of rewards influence performance in cognitively demanding tasks?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS; INCENTIVES; PRESSURE; PAY; PUBLICATION; MOTIVATION; CHOKING; INSIGHT; IMPACT	Classic micro-economic and psychology theories propose different implications of monetary incentives on performance. Empirical studies in sports settings show that athletes generally perform worse when the stakes are higher, while a range of lab studies involving cognitively demanding tasks have led to diverging results, supporting positive, negative and null-effects of higher (vs. lower) stakes. In order to further investigate this issue, we present a pre-registered, randomized, controlled trial of 149 participants solving both anagrams and math addition tasks. We do not find a statistically significant effect of the size of the reward on neither performance, self-reported effort nor intrinsic motivation. We propose that future studies should contrast the potential impact of rewards on different kinds of task, e.g. compare tasks that solely require cognitive effort vs. tasks that require motor skills, as in sports.

This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset. Methods SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels were quantified using two clinically validated and widely used commercial serological assays (Architect, Abbott Laboratories and iFlash 1800, YHLO), detecting antibodies against the spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Results Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P= 0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. Conclusions Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys.

Methods This is an ancillary study in a single center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) in which 74 patients with PXE were assigned to either one-year etidronate or placebo treatment. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging and color fundus photography were performed every three months for one year and were systematically assessed on signs of CNV activity. Results In the etidronate group, 11 (30%) of the patients had CNV activity at baseline, compared to 25 (67%) of the patients in the placebo group (P= 0.005). The proportion of eyes with CNV activity during the study ranged from 18-33% in the etidronate group and 42-56% in the placebo group and no significant difference in improvement or worsening of CNV activity was found (P= 0.168). Using a generalized mixed model for repeated measures, there was a protective effect of etidronate in crude analysis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98) that disappeared when adjusting for baseline CNV activity (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.13). Conclusion In this post-hoc RCT analysis we did not observe a protecting or deteriorating effect of etidronate on CNV activity in patients with PXE after adjustment for baseline CNV.

Systematic and independent examination of records, documents and processes through audits are a central element of quality management systems. In the context of current concerns about the robustness and reproducibility of experimental biomedical research audits have been suggested as a remedy a number of times. However, audits are resource intense and time consuming, and due to their very nature may be perceived as inquisition. Consequently, there is very little experience or literature on auditing and assessments in the complex preclinical biomedical research environment. To gain some insight into which audit approaches might best suit biomedical research in academia, in this study we have applied a number of them in a typical academic neuroscience environment consisting of twelve research groups with about 100 researchers, students and technicians, utilizing the full gamut of state-of-the-art methodology. Several types of assessments and internal as well as external audits (including the novel format of a peer audit) were systematically explored by a team of quality management specialists. An experimental design template was developed (and is provided here) that takes into account and mitigates difficulties, risks and systematic errors that may occur during the course of a study. All audits were performed according to a pre-defined workflow developed by us. Outcomes were assessed qualitatively. We asked for feedback from participating employees in every final discussion of an audit and documented this in the audit reports. Based on these reports follow-up audits were improved. We conclude that several realistic options for auditing exist which have the potential to improve preclinical biomedical research in academia, and have listed specific recommendations regarding their benefits and provided practical resources for their implementation (e.g. study design and audit templates, audit workflow).

NOV.; BIOMASS; MANAGEMENT; RHIZOSPHERE	The long-term impact of human exploitation and environmental changes has led to a decline in grassland productivity and soil fertility, which eventually results in grassland degradation. The application of organic fertilizer is an effective improvement measure; however, it is still not fully understood how the addition of organic fertilizer influences grassland soil fertility and plant composition. A set of experiments were conducted in Inner Mongolia in China to reveal the tradeoff between steppe plants and soil microorganisms and the eco-physiological mechanisms involved, and how the addition of vermicompost and mushroom residues affect microbial diversity, enzyme activities, and the chemical properties of soil in degradedLeymus chinensisgrassland. Organic fertilizer improved the soil nutrient status and shaped distinct bacterial communities. Compared with the control the available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) contents were highest under treatments a3 and b3, and the aboveground biomass was highest under the b3 treatment. Soil sucrase activities increased by 7.88% under the b3 treatment. Moreover, the richness index significantly increased by 7.07% and 7.23% under the a1 and b2 treatments, respectively. The most abundant Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were detected in the organic fertilizer treatment. A linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) indicated that the bacterial community was significantly increased under the b3 treatment. A canonical correspondence analysis (RDA) and spearman correlation heatmap confirmed that total P (TP) and urease were the key driving factors for shaping bacterial communities in the soil. Our results indicated that the application of large amounts of vermicompost and mushroom residues increased the availability of nutrients and also enhanced the biodiversity of soil bacterial communities inL.chinensisgrasslands, which will contribute to the sustainable development of agro-ecosystems.

J	Al-Khalil, O; Valeri, F; Senn, O; Rosemann, T; Di Gangi, S				Al-Khalil, Omar; Valeri, Fabio; Senn, Oliver; Rosemann, Thomas; Di Gangi, Stefania			Effects of a DRG-based hospital reimbursement on the health care utilization and costs in Swiss primary care: A retrospective "quasi-experimental" analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PAYMENT; DESIGNS; SERIES	Introduction In Switzerland, a nationwide Swiss Diagnosis related Groups (Swiss DRG) system for hospital reimbursement was introduced in 2012. However, the impact of DRG systems on primary care is still unclear with respect to number of consultations and costs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the implementation of DRG on costs and volumes in the primary care sector, on a nationwide basis in Switzerland. Methods The study retrospectively analysed yearly data, from 2008 to 2014, of almost 60 Swiss health insurers that covered almost all Swiss general practitioners, with a total number of patients which represented approximately 76% of the Swiss population. GP consultations, total numbers and rates, and the relative costs reimbursed (TARMED tariff values) in the Swiss federal states, cantons, which already introduced a DRG-like system before 2012 (AP-DRG), were compared to the GP consultations and costs reimbursed in the other cantons (DRG-naive). Regression discontinuity design analysis and mixed regression models, at cantonal level, were performed to evaluate the effect of the nationwide implementation of the Swiss DRG on health care demand and costs in the primary care setting. Change in outcome level and yearly trend pattern difference between groups (AP-DRG vs. DRG-naive) were examined. Results Overall, the total number of GP consultations and the relative TARMED values increased from 2008 to 2014. In the DRG naive, 15 cantons: in 2008, the number of GP consultations were 13,114,126, with a TARMED value of 1,194,957,157 CHF, and in 2014, the GP consultation were 13,752,511, with a TARMED value of 1,513,861,260 CHF. In the AP-DRG group, 11 cantons, the total number of GP consultations increased from 8,787,646, in 2008, to 9,347,168 in 2014 and the TARMED value increased from 896,673,657 CHF in 2008, to 1,100,203,508 CHF in 2014. The yearly trend pattern of GP consultations and TARMED values, in the AP-DRG group, were not significantly different from the respective trends in the DRG- naive and, overall, no significant change was detected in consultations and costs trends before and after 2012. Discussion/Conclusion This study found no evidence of any effect of the introduction of the SwissDRG on the yearly trend of primary care consultations and costs. Nevertheless, potential negative impacts on vulnerable patients, as chronically ill patients, could not be excluded and further investigation is required.

Most studies of sleep misperception examine sleep underestimation by comparing the results of polysomnography conducted in a laboratory environment with patients' sleep diary entries. We aimed to investigate psychosocial characteristics of adults who underestimated or overestimated sleep time in a nonclinical, middle-aged community-dwelling population. We collected one week of sleep data with wrist-worn accelerometers. We used egocentric social network analysis to analyze the effects of psychosocial factors. Among 4,060 study participants, 922 completed the accelerometer substudy. Underestimation was defined as an accelerometer-measured sleep time >= 6 h and a subjective sleep time < 6 h. Overestimation was defined as an objective sleep time < 6 h and a subjective sleep time >= 6 h. Psychosocial characteristics of the sleep misperception group were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. A total of 47 participants underestimated sleep time, and 420 overestimated sleep time. Regression analysis revealed that women, living with spouse, economic satisfaction, and bridging potential had protective effects against sleep underestimation. Blame from a spouse involved a 3.8-times higher risk of underestimation than the control group (p = 0.002). In men, discussing concerns with a spouse had a protective effect against underestimation (p < 0.001). Economic satisfaction, feeling social network-based intimacy, and support from a spouse were associated with overestimation in women. In men, feeling social network-based intimacy was also associated with overestimation (p < 0.001). We found that social relationship quality was related to sleep overestimation and underestimation. This association was marked in women. Good social relationships may have positive effects on sleep misperception via attenuation of negative emotional reactions and effects on emotional regulation.

Omega-3 fatty acid supplement use and oxidative stress levels in pregnancy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FISH-OIL SUPPLEMENTATION; POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; MATERNAL MICRONUTRIENTS; PLASMA MALONDIALDEHYDE; BIOLOGICAL MARKERS; PHTHALATE EXPOSURE; TELOMERE LENGTH; PRETERM BIRTH; BIOMARKER; F-2-ISOPROSTANES	Oxidative stress is a biological imbalance in reactive oxygen species and antioxidants. Increased oxidative stress during pregnancy has been associated with adverse birth outcomes. Omega-3 fatty acid (n-3 FA) supplementation may decrease oxidative stress; however, this relationship is seldom examined during pregnancy. This study assessed the association between n-3 FA supplement use during pregnancy and urinary oxidative stress biomarker concentrations. Data came from The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES), a prospective cohort study that recruited pregnant women in 4 US cities between 2010-2012. Third trimester n-3 FA intake was self-reported. Third trimester urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha (8-iso-PGF(2 alpha)) was measured as an oxidative stress biomarker. Additionally, we measured the major metabolite of 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) and Prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) and utilized the 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) to PGF(2 alpha) ratio to calculate the change in 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) reflecting oxidative stress versus inflammation. Adjusted linear models were used to determine associations with control for confounding. Of 725 women, 165 reported n-3 FA supplement use in the third trimester. In adjusted linear models, n-3 FA use was associated with 10.2% lower levels of 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -19.6, 0.25) and 10.3% lower levels of the metabolite (95% CI: -17.1, -2.91). No associations were observed with PGF(2 alpha). The lower levels of 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) appeared to reflect a decrease in oxidative stress (percent change with supplement use: -18.7, 95% CI: -30.1, -5.32) rather than inflammation. Overall, third trimester n-3 FA intake was associated with lower concentrations of 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) and its metabolite, suggesting a decrease in maternal oxidative stress during pregnancy.

Does peer-navigated linkage to care work? A cross-sectional study of active linkage to care within an integrated non-communicable disease-HIV testing centre for adults in Soweto, South Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ADHERENCE; ART; RESILIENCE; ENGAGEMENT; MANAGEMENT; INITIATION; CONTINUUM	Introduction South Africa is the HIV epidemic epicentre; however, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will be the most common cause of death by 2030. To improve identification and initiation of care for HIV and NCDs, we assessed proportion of clients referred and linked to care (LTC) for abnormal/positive screening results and time to LTC and treatment initiation from a HIV Testing Services (HTS) Centre before and after integrated testing for NCDs with optional peer-navigated linkage to care. Materials and methods This two-phase prospective study was conducted at an adult HTS Centre in Soweto, South Africa. Phase 1 (February-June 2018) utilised standard of care (SOC) HTS services (blood pressure [BP], HIV rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), sexually transmitted infections [STI]/Tuberculosis [TB] symptom screening) with passive referral for abnormal/positive results. Phase 2 (June 2018-March 2019) further integrated blood glucose/cholesterol/chlamydia RDT, with optional peer-navigated referral. Enrolled referred clients completed telephonic follow-up surveys confirming LTC/treatment initiation <= 3 months post-screening. Socio-demographics, screening results, time to LTC/treatment initiation, peer-navigated referral uptake were reported. Analysis included Fisher's exact, chi-squared, Kruskal Wallis, and Student's T-tests. Thematic analysis was conducted for open-ended survey responses. Results Of all 320 referrals, 40.0% were HIV-infections, 11.9% STIs, 6.6% TB, and 28.8% high/low BP. Of Phase 2-only referrals, 29.4% were for glucose and 23.5% cholesterol. Integrated NCD-HTS had significantly more clients LTC for HIV (76.7%[n = 66/86] vs 52.4%[n = 22/42], p = 0.0052) and within a shorter average time (6-8 days [Interquartile range (IQR):1-18.5] vs 8-13 days [IQR:2-32]) as compared to SOC HTS. Integrated NCD-HTS clients initiated HIV/STIs/BP treatment on average more quickly as compared to SOC HTS (5 days for STIs [IQR:1-21], 8 days for HIV/BP [IQR:5-17 and 2-13, respectively] vs 10 days for STIs [IQR: 4-32], 19.5 days for HIV [IQR:6.5-26.5], 8 days for BP [IQR:2-29)]. Participants chose passive over active referral (89.1% vs 10.9%; p<0.0001). Participants rejecting peer-navigated referral preferred to go alone (55.7% [n = 39/70]). Non-LTC was due to being busy (41.1% [n = 39/95]) and not being ready/refusing treatment (31.6% [n = 30/95]). Normalised results assessed at referral clinic (49.7% [n = 98/196]), prescribed lifestyle modification/monitoring (30.9% [n = 61/196]), and poor clinic flow/congestion and/or further testing required (10.7% [n = 21/196]) were associated with non-treatment initiation. Conclusion Same-day treatment initiation is not achieved across diseases, despite peer-navigated referral. There are psychosocial and health systems barriers at entry to care/treatment initiation. Additional research may identify best strategies for rapid treatment initiation.

OrganoidTracker: Efficient cell tracking using machine learning and manual error correction	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEGMENTATION; DISEASE	Time-lapse microscopy is routinely used to follow cells within organoids, allowing direct study of division and differentiation patterns. There is an increasing interest in cell tracking in organoids, which makes it possible to study their growth and homeostasis at the singlecell level. As tracking these cells by hand is prohibitively time consuming, automation using a computer program is required. Unfortunately, organoids have a high cell density and fast cell movement, which makes automated cell tracking difficult. In this work, a semi-automated cell tracker has been developed. To detect the nuclei, we use a machine learning approach based on a convolutional neural network. To form cell trajectories, we link detections at different time points together using a min-cost flow solver. The tracker raises warnings for situations with likely errors. Rapid changes in nucleus volume and position are reported for manual review, as well as cases where nuclei divide, appear and disappear. When the warning system is adjusted such that virtually error-free lineage trees can be obtained, still less than 2% of all detected nuclei positions are marked for manual analysis. This provides an enormous speed boost over manual cell tracking, while still providing tracking data of the same quality as manual tracking.	[Kok, Rutger N.

It is common in patients of African ancestry. Currently, there is paucity of data on the burden, predictors and outcomes of PPCM in Uganda. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, predictors and six-month outcomes of PPCM in an adult cohort attending a tertiary specialised cardiology centre in Kampala, Uganda. Methods This study consecutively enrolled 236 women presenting with features of acute heart failure in the peripartum period. Clinical evaluation and echocardiography were performed on all the enrolled women. PCCM was defined according to recommendations of the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on PPCM. Poor outcome at six months of follow-up was defined as presence of any of the following: death of a mother or her baby, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV or failure to achieve complete recovery of left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction <= 55%). Results The median age, BMI and parity of the study participants was 31.5 (25.5-38.0) years, 28.3 (26.4-29.7) and 3 (2-4) respectively. The prevalence of PPCM was 17.4% (n = 41/236). Multiple pregnancy was the only predictor of PPCM in this study population (OR 4.3 95% CI 1.16-16.05, p = 0.029). Poor outcome at six-months was observed in about 54% of the patients with PPCM (n = 4, 9.8% in NYHA functional class III-IV and n = 22, 53.7% with LVEF <55%). No maternal or foetal mortality was documented. Conclusion PPCM is relatively common in Uganda and is associated with multiple pregnancy. Poor outcomes especially absence of complete recovery of left ventricular function are also common. Large studies to further investigate long-term maternal and foetal outcomes in Uganda are justified.

We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with CVD risk factors using the non-laboratory Framingham Generalized 10-Year CVD risk score among older people in Malaysia. This was a population-based cross-sectional study using data of 3,375 participants aged >= 60 years from the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015. Sociodemographic, health factors and clinical assessments (anthropometry and blood pressure) were included. Complex survey analysis was used to obtain prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We applied ordinal regression to determine the factors associated with CVD risk. The prevalence for the high 10-year CVD risk was 72.1%. Body mass index was higher among those aged 60-69 years in men (25.4kg/m(2), 95%CI 25.1-25.8) and women (26.7kg/m(2), 95%CI 26.3-27.1) than the other age groups. The factors associated with moderate and high 10-year CVD risk were Malay ethnicity (Odds Ratio(OR) 0.76, 95%CI 0.63-0.92, p = 0.004), unmarried status (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.22-1.97, p<0.001) and physically inactive (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.55-0.95, p = 0.020). There is a need for future study to evaluate preventive strategies to improve the health of older people in order to promote healthy ageing.

In this study we observed the dynamics of endogenous cruciform DNA in mouse growing oocytes using immunofluorescence labeling method. We found cruciform DNA foci exist in transcription active growing oocytes but not in transcription inactive fully grown oocytes and colocalized with Parp1 but not with DNA damage marker gamma H2A.X. By analyzing the Genotype-Tissue Expression data, we found cruciform DNA-mediated chromosomal translocation in human spermatocytes is associated with the specific DNA transcription in testis. When inhibiting the transcription with alpha-amanitin in mouse oocytes, we found oocyte cruciform DNA foci decreased significantly. In summary, we observed the endogenous cruciform DNA in growing oocytes and our results showed that the cruciform DNA formation is transcription-dependent.

In this study, we identified a new strain EC2 from rice in Guangdong province, China. This strain differed from the previously identified strain from rice in its biochemical characteristics, pathogenicity, and genomic constituents. To explore genomic discrepancies between EC2 and previously identified strains from rice, a complete genome sequence of EC2 was obtained and used for comparative genomic analyses. The complete genome sequence of EC2 is 4,575,125 bp in length. EC2 was phylogenetically closest to previously identifiedDickeyastrains from rice, but not within their subgroup. In terms of secretion systems, genomic comparisons revealed that EC2 harbored only type I (T1SS), typeII (T2SS), and type VI (T6SS) secretion systems. The flagella cluster of this strain possessed specific genomic characteristics like otherD.zeaestrains from Guangdong and from rice; within this locus, the genetic diversity among strains from rice was much lower than that of within strains from non-rice hosts. Unlike other strains from rice, EC2 lost the zeamine cluster, but retained the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-1 (CRISPR-1) array. Compared to the otherD.zeaestrains containing both exopolysaccharide (EPS) and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) clusters, EC2 harbored only the CPS cluster, while the other strains from rice carried only the EPS cluster. Furthermore, we found strain MS1 from banana, carrying both EPS and CPS clusters, produced significantly more EPS than the strains from rice, and exhibited different biofilm-associated phenotypes. Comparative genomics analyses suggest EC2 likely evolved through a pathway different from the otherD.zeaestrains from rice, producing a new type of rice foot rot pathogen. These findings emphasize the emergence of a new type ofD.zeaestrain causing rice foot rot, an essential step in the early prevention of this rice bacterial disease.

Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in patients who received short (<= 7 days) versus long courses (>7 days) of antimicrobial therapy for complicated ESBL-EB urinary tract infections. Methods This is a retrospective and observational study. Positive urine cultures for ESBL-EB in our hospital between March 2015 and July 2017 were identified. Patients with complicated urinary tract infection were included. Differences between treatment groups (7 days or less vs more than 7 days) were analyzed according to baseline characteristics and severity of clinical presentation. Primary outcome was all cause 30-day mortality. Secondary outcome was a combined item of all cause mortality and reinfection by the same enterobacteria at 30 days. Results 273 urine cultures were positive for ESBL-EB during the study period. 75 episodes were included, 40 in the long treatment group and 35 in the short treatment group. Mean treatment duration in short and long treatment groups was 6,1 and 13,8 days respectively. Mortality at 30 days was 5,7% in the short treatment group and 5% in the long treatment group without significant differences (P = 0,8). Mortality or reinfection by the same ESBL-EB at 30 days was 8,6% in the short treatment group and 10% in the long treatment group, without significant differences (P = 0,8). Conclusions Short courses of antimicrobial treatment seems to be effective as treatment of complicated urinary tract infections by ESBL-EB.

This study aimed to develop a context-specific, culturally-appropriate training intervention for South Florida CHWs to educate Latinx immigrant farmworkers on breast cancer and early detection. Methods A community-based participatory research (CBPR) study, conducted 2017-2019, informed the design of a training curriculum for CHWs and educational dissemination materials. Twenty-two CHWs were trained and knowledge gains were measuring using a one-group pre-and post-test design. Triangulated evaluation consisted of field observations of CHW-client interactions, CHW self-reports, and rapid assessment surveys of community members. Results A community stakeholder-informed breast cancer training curriculum resulted in significant, sustained breast cancer knowledge gains among CHWs when comparing pre-, post-, and 4-6 month post-training follow-up test scores. Field observations of educational material dissemination, CHW self-reported evaluations, and community rapid assessment surveys at three health fairs demonstrated this was an effective strategy to engage female Latinx farmworkers in breast cancer education. Conclusions Community and key stakeholder participation in the development of a breast cancer educational intervention allowed for tailored design priorities around knowledge-based content, comprehensiveness, relevance, appropriateness, and ease of dissemination to community members. This model of participatory CHW training intervention design can enable future train-the-trainer approaches to disseminate and scale-up evidence-based health education interventions.

Currently, diabetes is increasingly becoming a major threat to global public health, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although previous studies emphasized knowledge and health beliefs about diabetes among patients living with diabetes, there is minimal evidence about knowledge and perception of risk for developing diabetes at the community level. Objective This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception of diabetes mellitus and its associated factors among people in Debre Berhan town, northeast Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 participants. The study was carried out from 25 February to 10 March 2019. Data were collected using a structured pretested questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. Data were entered into Epi data V 3.1 and exported to SPSS V 24 for analysis. A variable with p< 0.2 in bivariable analysis was entered into multivariable logistic regression. During multivariate analysis, variables with a p value of <= 0.05 were considered significantly associated. Result A total of 237 (56.02%) participants had good general knowledge about diabetes mellitus. In the multivariable analysis, participants who were single (AOR = 9.08, CI: 1.72-48), had a family history of diabetes (AOR = 2.83; CI: 1.10-7.24), and had exposure to health education (AOR = 3.27; CI: 2.02-5.31) were associated with good knowledge. In this study, few respondents (20.1%) felt that they had a higher risk of developing diabetes. Two-thirds of respondents (62.4%) saw diabetes is a serious disease. On the other hand, approximately 67% agreed to the perceived benefits of screening. Conclusion Almost half of the Debre Berhan community was found to have inadequate knowledge of diabetes mellitus. Married, higher educational status, exposure to health education, and family history of diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with good knowledge. The perceived risk of developing diabetes was low at the community level, although many respondents felt that behavior change is important in the prevention of diabetes. Therefore, policy makers, healthcare managers, and healthcare workers need to work cooperatively to foster community knowledge towards diabetes mellitus.

Materials and methods Sixteen polyvinylsiloxane impressions were taken from patients for single crown restorations and were scanned using CBCT. The scanning data were converted to positive Standard Triangulation Language (STL) files using custom-developed software. The fabricated stone models were scanned with an intraoral optical scanner (IOS) to compare the surface accuracy with the STL data obtained by CBCT. The converted STL files were utilized to fabricate interim crowns with a photopolymer using a digital light-processing 3D printer. The replica method was used to analyze the accuracy. The marginal and internal gaps in the replica specimen of each interim crown were measured with a digital microscope. The Friedman test and Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon-signed rank test) were conducted to compare the measurements of the marginal and internal gaps with a 95% level of confidence. Results The root-mean-square values of the CBCT and IOS ranged from 41.00 to 126.60 mu m, and the mean was 60.12 mu m. The mean values of the marginal, internal, and total gaps were 132.96 (+/- 139.23) mu m, 137.86 (+/- 103.09) mu m, and 135.68 (+/- 120.30) mu m, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the marginal or internal gaps between the mesiodistal and buccolingual surfaces, but the marginal area (132.96 mu m) and occlusal area (255.88 mu m) had significant mean differences. Conclusion The marginal gap of the fabricated interim crowns based on CBCT STL data was within the acceptable range of clinical success. Through ongoing developments of high-resolution CBCT and the digital model conversion technique, CBCT might be an alternative method to acquire digital models for interim crown fabrication.

Typically, complex phenotypes are investigated under varying conditions. While approaches for comparing nodes and links in two networks exist, almost no methods for the comparison of multiple networks are available and-to best of our knowledge-no comparative method allows for whole transcriptomic network analysis. However, it is the aim of many studies to compare networks of different conditions, for example, tissues, diseases, treatments, time points, or species. Here we present a method for the systematic comparison of an unlimited number of networks, with unlimited number of transcripts:Co-expression Differential Network Analysis (CoDiNA). In particular, CoDiNA detects linksandnodes that are common, specific or different among the networks. We developed a statistical framework to normalize between these different categories of common or changed network links and nodes, resulting in a comprehensive network analysis method, more sophisticated than simply comparing the presence or absence of network nodes. Applying CoDiNA to a neurogenesis study we identified candidate genes involved in neuronal differentiation. We experimentally validated one candidate, demonstrating that its overexpression resulted in a significant disturbance in the underlying gene regulatory network of neurogenesis. Using clinical studies, we compared whole transcriptome co-expression networks from individuals with or without HIV and active tuberculosis (TB) and detected signature genes specific to HIV. Furthermore, analyzing multiple cancer transcription factor (TF) networks, we identified common and distinct features for particular cancer types. These CoDiNA applications demonstrate the successful detection of genes associated with specific phenotypes. Moreover, CoDiNA can also be used for comparing other types of undirected networks, for example, metabolic, protein-protein interaction, ecological and psychometric networks. CoDiNA is publicly available as anRpackage in CRAN (https://CRAN. R-project.org/package=CoDiNA).

However, the clinical effects of it remains unclear. Purpose The purpose of this article is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of BXD for CAG treatment. Methods We searched seven electronic databases including Ovid, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Wan-fang database, VIP (Chinese Scientific Journals Database) and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) from their inception to September 21, 2020. We used Jadad scale and Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool to make evaluation of methodological quality. Revman 5.3 statistical software was used for statistical processing to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of BXD. Results 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) totaling 1985 patients were identified for analysis. Meta-analysis showed that BXD treatment was more effective (RR 1.29; 95%CI 1.24, 1.35; P<0.00001) and safe (MD 0.33; 95%CI 0.18, 0.58; P = 0.0002) than Chinese patent medicine + western medicine. Furthermore, BXD had improvement on symptoms scores such as stomach distending pain, and belching. Besides, BXD was more effective in inhibiting Helicobacter Pylori (HP), improving HP-related inflammation, and relieving the degree of glandular atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia of gastric mucosa (GM). Conclusions The meta-analysis showed that BXD was more effective and safer for CAG patients than the control group. However, due to limitations of methodological quality and small sample size of the included studies, further standardized research of rigorous design should be needed.

The main plant hosts of D. destructor contain plenty of starch, which makes the parasitic environment of D. destructor to be different from those of most other plant-parasitic nematodes. It is speculated that D. destructor may harbor some unique pathogenesis-related genes to parasitize the starch-rich hosts. Herein, we focused on the multi-copy alpha-amylase genes in D. destructor, which encode a key starch-catalyzing enzyme. Our previously published D. destructor genome showed that it has three alpha-amylase encoding genes, Dd_02440, Dd_11154, and Dd_13225. Comparative analysis of alpha-amylases from different species demonstrated that the other plant-parasitic nematodes, even Ditylenchus dipsaci in the same genus, harbor only one or no alpha-amylase gene, and the three genes from D. destructor were closely clustered in the phylogenetic tree, indicating that there was a unique expansion of the alpha-amylase gene in D. destructor. The enzymatic activity of the three alpha-amylase proteins was verified by an enzyme assay. Quantitative real-time PCR assay showed that the expression of the three alpha-amylase genes in the post-hatching stage of D. destructor was found to be significantly higher than that in eggs. In the in situ hybridization assay, the expression of the genes was localized to the intestine, implying the association of these genes with nematode digestion. An infection assay in sweet potato demonstrated that RNA interference of any one alpha-amylase gene had no influence on the infectivity of D. destructor. Using the multi-target dsRNA cocktail method, it was found that silencing of two of the three genes inhibited nematode infection, and the infectivity of worms treated with three dsRNA simultaneously changed the most, which decreased by 76.6%. Thus, the multi-copy alpha-amylase genes in D. destructor are compensatory and crucial for nematodes to parasitize the plant host.

NTS nephritis was induced by administration of anti-basement membrane antibodies to C57BL/6 mice and three dosages of SSC were administered for 14 days. Proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, renal histology, urinary MGO and d-lactate changes were examined. Compared to the NTS control group, the middle dosage (10 mg/kg/day) of SSC significantly alleviated the development of nephritis based on urine protein measurements (34.40 +/- 6.85 vs. 17.33 +/- 4.79 mg/day, p0.05). Pathological observation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) revealed monocyte infiltration, hypertrophy, and crescents were alleviated, and injury scoring also showed improved efficacy for the middle dose of SSC during nephritis (7.92 +/- 1.37 vs. 3.50 +/- 1.14, p0.05). Moreover, the significant decreases in urinary levels of MGO (24.71 +/- 3.46 vs. 16.72 +/- 2.36 mu g/mg, p0.05) and D-lactate (0.31 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.02 mu mol/mg, p0.05) were consistent with the biochemical and pathological examinations. This study demonstrates that MGO and D-lactate may reflect the extent of damage and the efficacy of SSC in NTS nephritis; further studies are required to enable clinical application.

The long-term influences of UP on dialysis patients are still poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the contribution of UP to long-term outcomes. Materials and method We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct this study. Patients on chronic dialysis were included and divided into UP and non-UP groups according to the long-term prescription of antihistamine in the absence of other indications. The outcomes include infection-related hospitalization, catheter-related infection, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and parathyroidectomy. Results After propensity score matching, 14,760 patients with UP and 29,520 patients without UP were eligible for analysis. After a mean follow-up of 5 years, we found that infection-related hospitalization, MACCE, catheter-related infection, heart failure and parathyroidectomy were all slightly higher in the UP than non-UP group (hazard ratio: 1.18 [1.16-1.21], 1.05 [1.01-1.09], 1.16 [1.12-1.21], 1.08 [1.01-1.16] and 1.10 [1.01-1.20], respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed that the increased risk of adverse events by UP was generally more apparent in younger patients and patients who underwent peritoneal dialysis. Conclusion UP may be significantly associated with an increased risk of long-term morbidities.

Perceiving jittering self-motion in a field of lollipops from ages 4 to 95	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; POSTURAL CONTROL; VISUAL CUES; VECTION; CHILDREN; HEAD; PERCEPTION; WALKING; YOUNG; SEX	An internal model of self-motion provides a fundamental basis for action in our daily lives, yet little is known about its development. The ability to control self-motion develops in youth and often deteriorates with advanced age. Self-motion generates relative motion between the viewer and the environment. Thus, the smoothness of the visual motion created will vary as control improves. Here, we study the influence of the smoothness of visually simulated self-motion on an observer's ability to judge how far they have travelled over a wide range of ages. Previous studies were typically highly controlled and concentrated on university students. But are such populations representative of the general public? And are there developmental and sex effects? Here, estimates of distance travelled (visual odometry) during visually induced self-motion were obtained from 466 participants drawn from visitors to a public science museum. Participants were presented with visual motion that simulated forward linear self-motion through a field of lollipops using a head-mounted virtual reality display. They judged the distance of their simulated motion by indicating when they had reached the position of a previously presented target. The simulated visual motion was presented with or without horizontal or vertical sinusoidal jitter. Participants' responses indicated that they felt they travelled further in the presence of vertical jitter. The effectiveness of the display increased with age over all jitter conditions. The estimated time for participants to feel that they had started to move also increased slightly with age. There were no differences between the sexes. These results suggest that age should be taken into account when generating motion in a virtual reality environment. Citizen science studies like this can provide a unique and valuable insight into perceptual processes in a truly representative sample of people.

Up to 30 June 2020, the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) collected data for 2,385 in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) patients with COVID-19 in England and Wales. Overall unadjusted survival at 1 week after date of positive COVID-19 test was 87.5% (95% CI 86.1-88.8%); mortality increased with age, treatment vintage and there was borderline evidence of Asian ethnicity (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.94-1.44) being associated with higher mortality. Compared to the general population, the relative risk of mortality for ICHD patients with COVID-19 was 45.4 and highest in younger adults. This retrospective cohort study based on UKRR data supports efforts to protect this vulnerable patient group.

The effect of environmental temperature on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19 and protective efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination towards COVID-19 remains ambiguous. Therefore, we explored the global impact of environmental temperature and neonatal BCG vaccination coverage on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19. The COVID-19 data for reported cases, deaths and global temperature were collected from 31(st)December 2020 to 3(rd)April 2020 for 67 countries. Temperature data were split into quartiles for all three categories (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and mean temperature). The impact of three types of temperature data and policy of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infection was determined by applying the multivariable two-level negative binomial regression analysis keeping daily new cases and daily mortality as outcome. The highest number of cases fell in the temperature categories as following:mean temperature in the second quartile(6 degrees C to 10.5 degrees C), median 26, interquartile range (IQR) 237;minimum temperature in the first quartile(-26 degrees C to 1 degrees C), median 23, IQR 173;maximum temperature in the second quartile (10 degrees C to 16 degrees C), median 27.5, IQR 219.For the minimum temperature category, 28% statistically significant lower incidence was noted for new cases from the countries falling in the second quartile (2 degrees C to 6 degrees C) compared with countries falling in the first quartile (-26 degrees C to 1 degrees C) (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.93). However, no statistically significant difference in incidence rate was observed for mean temperature categories in comparison to the first quartile. Countries with BCG vaccination policy had 58% less mortality as compared with countries without BCG coverage (IRR 0.42; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.95). Our exploratory study provides evidence that high temperature might not be associated with low transmissibility and countries having neonatal BCG vaccination policy had a low fatality rate of COVID-19.

The biological effect of the different PAH sources was studied by feeding juvenile haddock with low doses of PAHs (0.3-0.7 mg PAH/kg fish/day) for two months, followed by a two-months recovery. In addition to the oral exposure, a group of fish was exposed to 12 single compounds of PAHs (4/5/6-ring) via intraperitoneal injection. The main endpoint was the analysis of hepatic and intestinal DNA adducts. In addition, PAH burden in liver, bile metabolites, gene and protein expression of CYP1A, GST activity, lipid peroxidation, skeletal deformities and histopathology of livers were evaluated. Juvenile haddock responded quickly to both intraperitoneal injection and oral exposure of 4/5/6-ring PAHs. High levels of DNA adducts were detected in livers three days after the dose of the single compound exposure. Fish had also high levels of DNA adducts in liver after being fed with extracts dominated by 2-ring PAHs (a PW exposure scenario) and 3-ring PAHs (simulating an oil exposure scenario). Elevated levels of DNA adducts were observed in the liver of all exposed groups after the 2 months of recovery. High levels of DNA adduct were found also in the intestines of individuals exposed to oil or heavy PAHs, but not in the PW or control groups. This suggests that the intestinal barrier is very important for detoxification of orally exposures of PAHs.

J	Miyagawa, T; Sasaki, M; Yamaura, A				Miyagawa, Tadashi; Sasaki, Minami; Yamaura, Akira			Intracranial pressure based decision making: Prediction of suspected increased intracranial pressure with machine learning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NERVE SHEATH DIAMETER; TRANSORBITAL ULTRASOUND MEASUREMENT; INVASIVELY MEASURED ICP; OPTIC-NERVE; SUBARACHNOID SPACE; HYPERTENSION; ONSD	Background Repeated invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is desirable because many neurosurgical pathologies are associated with elevated ICP. On the other hand, it could become a risk for children to repeat sedation, anesthesia, or radiation exposure. As a non-invasive method, measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been revealed to accurately predict increased ICP. However, no studies have indicated a relationship among age, brain, and ventricular parameters in normal children, nor a prediction of increased ICP with artificial intelligence. Methods and findings This study enrolled 400 normal children for control and 75 children with signs of increased ICP between 2009 and 2019. Measurements of the parameters including ONSD on CT were obtained. A supervised machine learning was applied to predict suspected increased ICP based on CT measurements. A linear correlation was shown between ln(age) and mean ONSD (mONSD) in normal children, revealing mONSD = 0.36ln(age)+2.26 (R-2= 0.60). This study revealed a linear correlation of mONSD measured on CT with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. Additionally, the multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. The results of the group comparison between control and suspected increased ICP revealed a statistical significance in mONSD and the width of the ventricles. The study indicated that supervised machine learning application could be applied to predict suspected increased ICP in children, with an accuracy of 94% for training, 91% for test. Conclusions This study clarified three issues regarding ONSD and ICP. Mean ONSD measured on CT was correlated with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. The multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. Mean ONSD and the width of ventricles were statistically significant in children with signs of elevated ICP. Finally, the study showed that machine learning could be used to predict children with suspected increased ICP.

Decision making biases in the allied health professions: A systematic scoping review	PLOS ONE			English	Review							IMPLICIT RACIAL/ETHNIC BIAS; SEX BIAS; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY; SOCIAL-CLASS; RACE BIAS; DIAGNOSIS; JUDGMENT; OUTCOMES	Objectives Cognitive and other biases can influence the quality of healthcare decision making. While substantial research has explored how biases can lead to diagnostic or other errors in medicine, fewer studies have examined how they impact the decision making of other healthcare professionals. This scoping review aimed to identify and synthesise a broad range of research investigating whether decisions made by allied health professionals are influenced by cognitive, affective or other biases. Materials and methods A systematic literature search was conducted in five electronic databases. Title, abstract and full text screening was undertaken in duplicate, using prespecified eligibility criteria designed to identify studies attempting to demonstrate the presence of bias when allied healthcare professionals make decisions. A narrative synthesis was undertaken, focussing on the type of allied health profession, type of decision, and type of bias reported within the included studies. Results The search strategy identified 149 studies. Of these, 119 studies came from the field of psychology, with substantially fewer from social work, physical and occupational therapy, speech pathology, audiology and genetic counselling. Diagnostic and assessment decisions were the most common decision types, with fewer studies assessing treatment, prognostic or other clinical decisions. Studies investigated the presence of over 30 cognitive, affective and other decision making biases, including stereotyping biases, anchoring, and confirmation bias. Overall, 77% of the studies reported at least one outcome that represented the presence of a bias. Conclusion This scoping review provides an overview of studies investigating whether decisions made by allied health professionals are influenced by cognitive, affective or other biases. Biases have the potential to seriously impact the quality, consistency and accuracy of decision making in allied health practice. The findings highlight a need for further research particularly in professional disciplines outside of psychology, using methods that reflect real life healthcare decision making.

Being rare diseases, limited data are available about familial risks among these AIDs (concordant) or between them and other AIDs (discordant). We aimed to carry out an unbiased study on these AIDs based on medically diagnosed patients. We collected data on patients diagnosed in Swedish hospitals with AH, PBC and other AIDs and calculated familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for concordant and discordant familial relative risks. The number of AH patients was 6,269, of whom 43.0% were male; patient numbers for PBC were 4,269, with 17.8% males. AH accounted for 0.8% and 0.6% of all hospitalized AIDs in Sweden. For AH only the familial risk between siblings was significant (3.83). For PBC the risks for offspring of parents (9.05) and siblings (10.88) were high, but only risk for females was significant. Spousal risks were very high, 5.91 and 6.07 for AH. Risk for AH was 2.21 in families of PBC, and it was 2.47 for PBC in families of AH patients. Among other AIDs, 14 showed a significant association with AH, compared to 16 AIDs with PBC. The surprising finding in this nation-wide family study on medically diagnosed patients was the high risk for AH (6.0) between spouses, which exceed the risk between siblings, suggesting the existence of strong environmental risk factors. AH and PBC were associated with multiple other AIDs. The results call attention to environmental factors in AID etiology which should also be in focus in taking anamnestic data from patients.

Exact identification of reptile-specific but otherwise uncommon bacterial species may be challenging. However, identification is crucial to evaluate the importance of the detected bacterial species. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the number of aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from skin-derived samples of reptiles which were not reliably identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and to determine their identity. Material and methods Routine bacterial diagnostics were performed on 235 skin samples, and 417 bacterial isolates were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. The isolates were grouped into categories based on their first score: category I (>= 2.00), category II (>= 1.70 and < 2.00), and category III (< 1.70). Isolates from category III were further investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the following criteria were applied: query cover 100%, e-value rounded to 0.0 and sequence identity (%) > 98.00% for genus identification, and > 99.00% for species identification. Results The majority of bacterial isolates were in category I (85.1%) or category II (8.4%). In category III (6.5%) results achieved at first by MALDI-TOF MS corresponded to the results of the molecular analysis in 8.0% of isolates at the species level and in 24.0% at the genus level. Bacterial isolates classified as category III were heterogenic in genus (e.g.Chryseobacterium,Devriesea,Pseudomonas,Staphylococcus,Uruburuella), and some have only been described in reptiles so far. Conclusions Most of the aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from reptile skin achieved high scores by MALDI-TOF MS. However, in the majority of category III isolates MALDI-TOF MS results were different from those of the molecular analysis. This strengthens the need to carefully examine low-scored results for plausibility and to be familiar with the occurrence and morphology of relevant reptile-specific bacterial species (e.g.Devriesea agamarum) as well as with the limits of the database used.

Interspecific interactions among functionally diverse frugivores and their outcomes for plant reproduction: A new approach based on camera-trap data and tailored null models	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEED DISPERSAL; IBERIAN PEAR; SOLIDAGO-ALTISSIMA; CHAMAEROPS-HUMILIS; PYRUS-BOURGAEANA; COMPETITION; POLLINATOR; PREDATION; MUTUALISM; GOLDENROD	The study of plant-frugivore interactions is essential to understand the ecology and evolution of many plant communities. However, very little is known about how interactions among frugivores indirectly affect plant reproductive success. In this study, we examined direct interactions among vertebrate frugivores sharing the same fruit resources. Then, we inferred how the revealed direct interspecific interactions could lead to indirect (positive or negative) effects on reproductive success of fleshy fruited plants. To do so, we developed a new analytical approach that combines camera trap data (spatial location, visitor species, date and time, activity) and tailored null models that allowed us to infer spatial-temporal interactions (attraction, avoidance or indifference) between pairs of frugivore species. To illustrate our approach, we chose to study the system composed by the Mediterranean dwarf palm,Chamaerops humilis, the Iberian pear tree,Pyrus bourgaeana, and their shared functionally diverse assemblages of vertebrate frugivores in a Mediterranean area of SW Spain. We first assessed the extent to which different pairs of frugivore species tend to visit the same or different fruiting individual plants. Then, for pairs of species that used the same individual plants, we evaluated their spatial-temporal relationship. Our first step showed, for instance, that some prey frugivore species (e.g. lagomorphs) tend to avoid thoseC.humilisindividuals that were most visited by their predators (e.g. red foxes). Also, the second step revealed temporal attraction between large wild and domestic frugivore ungulates (e.g. red deer, cows) and medium-sized frugivores (e.g. red foxes) suggesting that large mammals could facilitate theC.humilisandP.bourgaeanaexploitation to other smaller frugivores by making fruits more easily accessible. Finally, our results allowed us to identify direct interaction pathways, that revealed how the mutualistic and antagonistic relations between animal associates derived into indirect effects on both plants seed dispersal success. For instance, we found that large-sized seed predators (e.g. ungulates) had a direct positive effect on the likelihood of visits by legitimate seed dispersers (e.g. red foxes) to both fleshy fruited plants. Then, seed predators showed an indirect positive effect on the plants' reproductive success. Our new analytical approach provides a widely applicable framework for further studies on multispecies interactions in different systems beyond plant-frugivore interactions, including plant-pollinator interactions, the exploitation of plants by herbivores, and the use of carcasses by vertebrate scavengers.

Methods A secondary analysis was conducted using data collected from a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1599 parents living in urban and rural areas of Mysore district, India. Applying two-stage probability proportionate-to-size sampling, adolescent girls attending 7th through 10th grades in 23 schools were selected to take home a questionnaire to be answered by their parents to primarily assess HPV vaccine intentions. Parents were also asked whether their children had received one dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin; three doses of Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus; three doses of oral Polio vaccine; and one dose of Measles vaccine. In addition, parents were asked about their attitudes towards childhood vaccination. Results Out of the 1599 parents, 52.2% reported that their children had received all the routine vaccines (fully vaccinated); 42.7% reported their children had missed at least one routine vaccine, and 5.2% reported that their children had missed all routine vaccinations. Perceptions about the benefits/facilitators to childhood vaccination significantly predicted the full vaccination rate (standardized regression coefficient (beta) = 0.29) directly and mediated the effect of parental education (beta = 0.11) and employment (beta = -0.06) on the rate of full vaccination. Parental education was significantly associated indirectly with higher rates of full vaccination (beta = 0.11). Parental employment was significantly associated indirectly with decreasing rates of full vaccination (beta = -0.05). Area of residence moderated the role of religion (beta = 0.24) and the `number of children' in a family (beta = 0.33) on parental perceptions about barriers to childhood vaccination. The model to data fit was acceptable (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.02, 95% CI 0.018 to 0.023; Comparative Fit Index = 0.92; Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.91). Conclusions Full vaccination rate was relatively low among children in Mysore, especially among parents who were unsure about the benefits of routine vaccination and those with low educational levels. Interventions increasing awareness of the benefits of childhood vaccination that target rural parents with lower levels of education may help increase the rate of full childhood vaccination in India.

Objective To examine the interaction between frailty and obesity on the clinical outcome of PD patients. Design Single centre prospective observational cohort study. Patients 267 prevalent Chinese PD patients were recruited. Measurements Frailty was identified by a standard score. General and central obesity were determined by body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR), respectively. Body composition was assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy. All patients were followed for two years. Outcome measures included all-cause as well as cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization. Results Of the 267 patients, 120 (44.9%) were frail. Frail individuals were more likely to have central obesity (p < 0.001) but not general obesity. Although WHR did not predict patient survival, there was a significant interaction between WHR and frailty on patient survival and cardiovascular survival (p = 0.002 and p = 0.038, respectively). For patients without frailty, the two-year cardiovascular survival was 91.3% and 74.4% for those with and without central obesity, respectively (p = 0.002). For patients with frailty, however, the two-year cardiovascular survival was 64.6% and 66.7% for those with and without central obesity, respectively (p = 0.6). For patients without frailty, the number of hospital admission for cardiovascular disease over 2 years were 0.12 +/- 0.37 and 0.34 +/- 0.72 for those with and without central obesity, respectively (p = 0.03). For frail patients, however, the number of hospital admission was similar between those with and without central obesity. Conclusion There is a significant interaction between frailty and central obesity on the outcome of PD patients. The protective role of central obesity is only apparent in PD patients without frailty but not the frail ones, and there is a little prognostic value of general (non-central) obesity.

However, up to date, little is known about the underlying temporal dynamics of sTNF-R1 concentrations and their relation with mortality. We aimed to characterize the effect of changes in sTNFR-1 levels on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, independent from other established risk factors for mortality, including other inflammatory markers. Methods We used data of the population based cohort study CARLA and included 1408 subjects with sTNF-R1 measured at baseline (2002-2006) and first follow-up (2007-2010). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association of baseline and follow-up sTNF-R1 measurements with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality during similar to 10 years since the first follow-up after adjusting for relevant confounders. Results Based on 211 deaths among 1408 subjects, per each doubling of the baseline sTNF-R1, the risk of all-cause mortality was increased by about 30% (Hazard ratio 1.28, 95% Confidence Interval 0.6-2.7), while per each doubling of the follow-up level of sTNF-R1 mortality was 3-fold (3.11, 1.5-6.5) higher in a model including both measurements and adjusting for confounders. The results were mainly related to the cardiovascular mortality (5.9, 2.1-16.8 per each doubling of follow up sTNF-R1 value). Conclusion Solely the follow-up value, rather than its change from baseline, predicted future mortality. Thus, while sTNF-R1 levels are associated with mortality, particularly cardiovascular, over a long-time period in the general population, if they change, the earlier measurements play no or little role.

J	Dhair, A; Abed, Y				Dhair, Amal; Abed, Yehia			The association of types, intensities and frequencies of physical activity with primary infertility among females in Gaza Strip, Palestine: A case-control study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; RISK-FACTORS; WOMEN; PREVALENCE; FERTILITY; EXERCISE	Introduction Physical activity and energy state balance have fundamentally been related to reproductive system and health. This study explored the relationship between different types, intensities and frequencies of physical activity with primary infertility among women in Gaza Strip, Palestine. Methods A case-control study was conducted in Gaza Strip with the participation of 320 married couples. 160 infertile couples were chosen from five fertility centers registries from 2016 to 2018 and matched residentially with 160 fertile couples. Cases were selected through systematic stratified sampling of five lists categorized according to residency and the determined percentage selected from each list was proportional. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire extended by the short form of international physical activity questionnaire and analyzed through SPSS program version 22 by using descriptive analysis, independent T-test, cross-tabulation, and binary logistic regression. Results Low frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity were associated with 3.1 risk of primary infertility (95% CI, 1.60-5.99, P < 0.001). Adjustment for age, marital age, age of menarche, refugee status and monthly income provided 3.2 risk (95% CI, 1.55-6.60, P = 0.002). Women spending more than 300 minutes a day sedentarily were 2.3 times more likely to have fertility problems than physically active females. Measuring energy expenditure in MET-min/w (Metabolic Equivalent) showed vigorous MET-min/w as negatively associated with the infertility status of females (Interquartile range IQR: 480 for cases and 720 for controls, P = 0.010). On the basis of energy expended in kilocalories in relation to weight, results showed the same association (IQR: 564 for case and 864 for controls, P = 0.011). No associations were found between moderate activity levels and primary infertility. Conclusion Low levels of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle endanger the fertility status of females in Gaza Strip. This may offer the need for endorsing and formalizing adequate physical activity education and awareness protocols in the national reproductive health guidelines and empowering environmental capacity building to alter physical activity-related cultural norms.

One is the CRF03_AB, which circulated in the region since late 1990s and probably became widespread in northwestern FSU countries. However, there is not much information provided about the dissemination of this recombinant. Here, we examine the prevalence, evolutionary dynamics and dispersion pattern of HIV-1 CRF03_AB recombinant. Methods We analyzed 32 independent studies and 151 HIV-1 CRF03_AB pol sequences isolated from different FSU countries over a period of 22 years. Pooled prevalence was estimated using a random effects model. Bayesian coalescent-based method was used to estimate the evolutionary, phylogeographic and demographic parameters. Results Our meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of CRF03_AB infection in northwestern FSU region was 5.9% [95%CI: 4.1-7.8]. Lithuania (11.6%), Russia (5.9%) and Belarus (2.9%) were the most affected by CRF03_AB. We found that early region wide spread of HIV-1 CRF03_AB originated from one viral clade that arose in the city of Kaliningrad in 1992 [95%HPD: 1990-1995]. Fourteen migration route of this variant were found. The city of Kaliningrad is involved in most of these, confirming its leading role in CRF03_AB spread within FSU. Demographic reconstruction point to this is that CRF03_AB clade seems to have experienced an exponential growth until the mid-2000s and a decrease in recent years. Conclusion These data provide new insights into the molecular epidemiology of CRF03_AB as well as contributing to the fundamental understanding of HIV epidemic in FSU.

We examined the effects of adding carcass and vitamin E to the diet on stress and reproductive biomarkers in male ferrets (n = 42 males including 16 juveniles and 26 adults) housed at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center (Carr, CO, USA). Fecal samples (3x/week) were collected from November and December (pre-breeding season, no diet change), February through May (breeding season, diet change) and June (post-breeding season, diet change) and analyzed for fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) via a corticosterone enzyme immunoassay (EIA). A subset of samples from adult males (n = 15) were analyzed for fecal androgen metabolites (FAM) via a testosterone EIA. We first used a linear mixed effects model to identify the important fixed effects among meat treatment, vitamin E treatment, age class (juvenile or adult), and all possible interactions on each hormone. We then examined the important factor's effects across seasons using the non-parametric Friedman test. We found that age did not influence (p = 0.33) FGMs; however there was a significant effect of meat treatment on FGM (p = 0.04) and an effect of vitamin E on FAMs (p<0.10). When fed carcass, FGMs declined (p<0.001) from pre- to the during the breeding season time period, but was similar (p>0.05) between during and post-breeding season periods. Males that were not fed carcass had higher (p<0.05) FGMs during the breeding season compared to pre- and post-breeding season and FGMs were lower (p<0.05) in the post-breeding season compared to pre-breeding season. Males fed with carcass had lower (p<0.001) FGM than males that were not fed carcass during both the pre-breeding and the breeding season but not during the post-breeding season (p>0.05). Males supplemented with vitamin E had higher (p<0.001) FAM than non-supplemented males during the breeding season only. For both groups, FAM was highest (p<0.05) during the breeding season. In conclusion, adding carcass to the diet can reduce glucocorticoid production and adding vitamin E can increase testosterone during the breeding season, which may influence reproductive success.

J	Alnajashi, H; Jabbad, R				Alnajashi, Hind; Jabbad, Razan			Behavioral practices of patients with multiple sclerosis during Covid-19 pandemic	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTITUDES; RESIDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; HEALTH	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and Covid-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic in March 2020. As the pandemic still unfolds, uncertainty circles around the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). To diminish the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and lessen the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of MS patients, it is essential to understand knowledge, attitudes, and various behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among MS patients. Therefore, this study aimed to look at the behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among patients with MS. A total of 176 MS patients diagnosed at least one year before the survey were conveniently sampled online in Saudi Arabia and their data collected using a structured interview questionnaire in electronic Google form. We determined the reliability of the questionnaire by measuring its internal consistency in a pilot sample of 30 participants. Overall, more than 80% of participants had good knowledge and attitudes towards Covid-19. However, this did not correlate well with the impact on healthcare (r = 0.06). Our study revealed that 46% of participants were anxious about taking their medication, and 32% of participants missed their hospital appointments. Furthermore, 15% of the participants had a relapse but did not go to the hospital because of the pandemic, 15.9% stopped their DMTs, and 35.2% missed drug infusions or refills. Our study revealed overall good knowledge and attitudes related to Covid-19 among MS patients. However, the healthcare impact was considerable, as 32% of the participants missed their hospital appointments, and another 15% had a relapse. This highlights the significance of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of patients with MS. Measures to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on healthcare service delivery to patients with MS, such as telemedicine, should be strongly encouraged.

However, as pulmonary hypertension is only partially reversible by oxygen administration, other etiological factors are likely involved. In human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary artery remodeling contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension. In rodent models, pulmonary vascular remodeling is present as a consequence of allergic airway inflammation. The present study investigated the presence of remodeling of the pulmonary arteries in severe equine asthma, its distribution throughout the lungs, and its reversibility following long-term antigen avoidance strategies and inhaled corticosteroid administration. Using histomorphometry, the total wall area of pulmonary arteries from different regions of the lungs of asthmatic horses and controls was measured. The smooth muscle mass of pulmonary arteries was also estimated on lung sections stained for alpha-smooth muscle actin. Reversibility of vascular changes in asthmatic horses was assessed after 1 year of antigen avoidance alone or treatment with inhaled fluticasone. Pulmonary arteries showed increased wall area in apical and caudodorsal lung regions of asthmatic horses in both exacerbation and remission. The pulmonary arteries smooth muscle mass was similarly increased. Both treatments reversed the increase in wall area. However, a trend for normalization of the vascular smooth muscle mass was observed only after treatment with antigen avoidance, but not with fluticasone. In conclusion, severe equine asthma is associated with remodeling of the pulmonary arteries consisting in an increased smooth muscle mass. The resulting narrowing of the artery lumen could enhance hypoxic vasoconstriction, contributing to pulmonary hypertension. In our study population, the antigen avoidance strategy appeared more promising than inhaled corticosteroids in controlling vascular remodeling. However, further studies are needed to support the reversibility of vascular smooth muscle mass remodeling after asthma treatment.

A statistical approach to white-nose syndrome surveillance monitoring using acoustic data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BAT ACTIVITY; WINTER; FOREST; FIRE	Traditional pathogen surveillance methods for white-nose syndrome (WNS), the most serious threat to hibernating North American bats, focus on fungal presence where large congregations of hibernating bats occur. However, in the western USA, WNS-susceptible bat species rarely assemble in large numbers and known winter roosts are uncommon features. WNS increases arousal frequency and activity of infected bats during hibernation. Our objective was to explore the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring as a surveillance tool for WNS. We propose a non-invasive approach to model pre-WNS baseline activity rates for comparison with future acoustic data after WNS is suspected to occur. We investigated relationships among bat activity, ambient temperatures, and season prior to presence of WNS across forested sites of Montana, USA where WNS was not known to occur. We used acoustic monitors to collect bat activity and ambient temperature data year-round on 41 sites, 2011-2019. We detected a diverse bat community across managed (n = 4) and unmanaged (n = 37) forest sites and recorded over 5.37 million passes from bats, including 13 identified species. Bats were active year-round, but positive associations between average of the nightly temperatures by month and bat activity were strongest in spring and fall. From these data, we developed site-specific prediction models for bat activity to account for seasonal and annual temperature variation prior to known occurrence of WNS. These prediction models can be used to monitor changes in bat activity that may signal potential presence of WNS, such as greater than expected activity in winter, or less than expected activity during summer. We propose this model-based method for future monitoring efforts that could be used to trigger targeted sampling of individual bats or hibernacula for WNS, in areas where traditional disease surveillance approaches are logistically difficult to implement or because of human-wildlife transmission concerns from COVID-19.

Patient-perceived treatment burden of tuberculosis treatment	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HEALTH; COSTS; CARE	Background Treatment for tuberculosis lasts for a minimum of 6 months. The treatment burden experienced by patients in a low-incidence setting where directly observed therapy is the standard of care is not well-known. Methods Patients receiving tuberculosis treatment through the chest clinic at a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia, participated in a semi-structured interview. The interviews explored the treatment burden experienced by patients and possible solutions to ameliorate this burden. Interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. They were recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo 12 software. Results Twenty participants (80% male, mean age 40 years) with pulmonary (n = 13) and extra-pulmonary (n = 7) tuberculosis were interviewed. Participants experienced healthcare, financial, social and medication burdens along with lifestyle changes due to treatment. Medication intake was challenging due to the high number of pills, and 55% (n = 11) of patients experienced fatigue amongst other side effects. Patients found clinic-based directly observed therapy inconvenient, especially those working and/or studying. Suggestions to lessen treatment burden included reducing medication burden and better access to health services. Conclusion Tuberculosis treatment is associated with substantial treatment burden for patients. Measures to reduce treatment burden including alternative treatment delivery methods which are more accommodating to patients than clinic-based directly observed therapy, such as video directly observed therapy or partially self -administered treatment, should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Methods We used Japan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance data on the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae and sales data obtained from IQVIA Services Japan K.K. for penicillin consumption. We analysed both sets of data by decomposing them into seasonality and chronological trend components. The cross-correlation function was checked using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to examine the correlation between susceptibility and consumption. Results After adjusting for seasonality, the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillins gradually improved (55.7% in 2013 and 60.6% in 2018, respectively) and penicillin consumption increased during the same period (0.76 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day [DID] in 2013, and 0.89 DID in 2018). The results showed positive cross-correlation (coefficient 0.801, p-value < 0.001). In contrast, cephalosporin consumption decreased (3.91 DID in 2013 and 3.19 DID in 2018) and showed negative cross-correlation with susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillins (coefficient - 0.981, p-value < 0.001). Conclusions The rates of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates did not negatively correlate with penicillin consumption at the population level. Increased penicillin consumption might not impair the penicillin susceptibility of S. pneumoniae.

Thus, we sought to determine CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and CD4/CD8 ratio responses in a cohort of HIV infected individuals on sustained suppressive ART followed up for more than a decade. Methods The cohort comprised adult patients who started ART between 2001 and 2007 and followed for up to 14 years. Trends in median CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and CD4/CD8 ratio were reviewed retrospectively. Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with achieving normalized T-cell biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the probability of attaining normalized counts while on suppressive ART. Results A total of 227 patients with a median duration of follow-up on ART of 12 (IQR: 10.5-13.0) years were included. CD4 cell count increased from baseline median of 138 cells (IQR: 70-202) to 555 cells (IQR: 417-830). CD4 cell increased continuously up until 5 years, after which it plateaued up until 14 years of follow up. Only 69.6% normalized their CD4 cell count within a median of 6.5 (IQR: 3.0-10.5) years. In addition, only 15.9% of the cohort were able to achieve the median reference CD4+ T-cell threshold count in Ethiopians (approximate to 760 cells/mu L). CD8+ T-cell counts increased initially until year 1, after which continuous decrease was ascertained. CD4/CD8 ratio trend revealed continuous increase throughout the course of ART, and increased from a median baseline of 0.14 (IQR: 0.09-0.22) to a median of 0.70 (IQR: 0.42-0.95). However, only 12.3% normalized their ratio (>= 1.0) after a median of 11.5 years. In addition, only 8.8% of the cohort were able to achieve the median reference ratio of healthy Ethiopians. Conclusion Determination of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, along with CD4/CD8 ratio is highly relevant in long-term follow-up of patients to assess immune recovery. Monitoring ratio levels may serve as a better biomarker risk for disease progression among patients on long-term ART. In addition, the findings emphasize the relevance of initiation of ART at the early stage of HIV-1 infection.

We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to either transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) or ventilators, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We validate our approach with realistic data from the United Kingdom and Spain. In the UK, we consider the National Health Service at the level of trusts and define a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates the four nearest neighbours of any given trust. In Spain we coarse-grain the healthcare system at the level of autonomous communities, and extract similar contact networks. Through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy, where the cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity. Our framework is general and flexible allowing for additional criteria, alternative cost functions, and can be extended to other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand, we show that it is possible to enable access to ICU for up to 1000 additional cases in the UK in a single step of the algorithm. Under a more realistic and heterogeneous demand, our method is able to balance about 600 beds per step in the Spanish system only using local sharing, and over 1300 using countrywide sharing, potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU.

The present study investigated the effect of elevated temperature and CO(2)concentrations on the growth, yield, and photosynthesis of potato (Solanum tuberosumL. cv. Superior) crops using Korean Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Research chambers that allow the regulation of temperature and CO(2)concentration under daylight conditions. Based on the average temperature from 1991 to 2010 in the Jeonju area, South Korea, potato plants were exposed to four different conditions: ambient weather (400 mu mol mol(-1), aCaT), elevated temperature (+4 degrees C, aCeT), elevated CO(2)concentration (800 mu mol mol(-1), eCaT), and concurrently elevated CO(2)concentration and temperature (eCeT). Under aCeT conditions, the temperature exceeded the optimal growth temperature range towards the late growth phase that decreased stomatal conductance and canopy net photosynthetic rate and subsequently reduced biomass and tuber yield. Stomatal conductance and chlorophyll concentration were lower under eCaT conditions than under aCaT conditions, whereas late-growth phase biomass and tuber yield were greater. Compared to other conditions, eCeT yielded a distinct increase in growth and development and canopy net photosynthetic rate during tuber initiation and bulking. Consequently, biomass and canopy net photosynthesis increased, and tuber yield increased by 20.3%, which could be attributed to the increased tuber size, rather than increased tuber number. Elevated CO(2)reduced chlorophyll, magnesium, and phosphorus concentrations; reducing nitrogen concentration (by approximately 39.7%) increased the C:N ratio. The data indicate that future climate conditions will likely change nutrient concentration and quality of crops. The present study shows that while elevated temperature may negatively influence the growth and yield of potato crops, especially towards the late-growth phase, the concurrent and appropriate elevation of CO(2)and temperature could promote balanced development of source and sink organs and positively effect potato productivity and quality.

We aimed to compare various Machine learning algorithms with a Meta learner approach to find the best of these as a predictor of NAFLD. Methods The study included 2970 subjects, 2920 constituting the training set and 50, randomly selected, used in the test phase, performing cross-validation. The best predictors were combined to create three models: 1) FLI plus GLUCOSE plus SEX plus AGE, 2) AVI plus GLUCOSE plus GGT plus SEX plus AGE, 3) BRI plus GLUCOSE plus GGT plus SEX plus AGE. Eight machine learning algorithms were trained with the predictors of each of the three models created. For these algorithms, the percent accuracy, variance and percent weight were compared. Results The SVM algorithm performed better with all models. Model 1 had 68% accuracy, with 1% variance and an algorithm weight of 27.35; Model 2 had 68% accuracy, with 1% variance and an algorithm weight of 33.62 and Model 3 had 77% accuracy, with 1% variance and an algorithm weight of 34.70. Model 2 was the most performing, composed of AVI plus GLUCOSE plus GGT plus SEX plus AGE, despite a lower percentage of accuracy. Conclusion A Machine Learning approach can support NAFLD diagnosis and reduce health costs. The SVM algorithm is easy to apply and the necessary parameters are easily retrieved in databases.

Aldose reductase inhibitor formCassia glauca: A comparative study of cytotoxic activity with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and molecular docking evaluation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SILVER NANOPARTICLES; FLAVONOL; EXTRACT; KINASES; CARDIOTOXICITY; IDENTIFICATION; DOXORUBICIN; ANTICANCER; GLYCOSIDES; ASSAY	UPLC-MS/MS profiling ofCassia glaucaleaves extract revealed the identification of 10 flavonoids. Kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-rutinoside was isolated and studied for its cytotoxic activity. It showed high cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 (IC(50)of 4.6 +/- 0.038 mu g/ml) and HepG-2 (IC(50)of 8.2 +/- 0.024 mu g/ml) cancer cell lines, compared to the leaves extracts, their Ag nanoparticles, and doxorubicin. Moreover, Kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-rutinoside exerted a synergistic cytotoxic effect with doxorubicin on MCF-7 cell lines. It was discovered as kinases and aldose reductase inhibitor while rationalizing its cytotoxic activity through molecular docking study. Thus, it is expected that the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin can be also decreased by using Kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-rutinoside due to its aldose reductase inhibitory effect. These findings suggested that Kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-rutinoside could be used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs to increase the sensitivity to their cytotoxic activity and protect against their side effects.

Methods Cross-sectional data about emotional, functional, and burden-related variables were collected from 85 patients with end-stage COPD and their 85 respective main family caregivers to determine the variables that could predict their emotional well-being. Descriptive analyses, comparison of means, hierarchical regression models, and comparative quali-quantitative analyses were carried out. Results Data show that the great majority of patients with COPD spend years with this diagnosis, and have been admitted to the hospital several times in advance stage of illness the previous year of the moment of end-of-life stage. Furthermore, only a tiny percentage of the patients were functionally independent in the advanced stage of illness. Conclusions The emotional distress and the burden of the family caregiver play an essential role in the distress of the patient, in conjunction with the patient's own functional independence and the time living with the disease, and comorbidity. On the other hand, variables of the patient, such as time since diagnosis, number of hospital admissions, comorbidity, functional dependence, and emotional distress, play an important role in the family caregiver's emotional distress and burden. Understanding how these variables are related is key to designing appropriate programs to reduce the emotional distress the patients with COPD at the end of life and their family caregivers.

Decreasing median age of COVID-19 cases in the United States-Changing epidemiology or changing surveillance?	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background Understanding and monitoring the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 infection can inform strategies for prevention. Surveillance monitoring has suggested that the age distribution of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 has changed since the pandemic began, but no formal analysis has been performed. Methods Retrospective review of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing results from a national reference laboratory was performed. Result distributions by age and positivity were compared between early period (March-April 2020) and late periods (June-July 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, a sub-analysis compared changing age distributions between inpatients and outpatients. Results There were 277,601 test results of which 19320 (7.0%) were positive. The median age of infected people declined over time (p < 0.0005). In March-April, the median age of positive people was 40.8 years (Interquartile range (IQR): 29.0-54.1). In June-July, the median age of positive people was 35.8 years (IQR: 24.0-50.2). The positivity rate of patients under 50 increased from 6.0 to 10.6 percent and the positivity rate for those over 50 decreased from 6.3 to 5.0 percent between the early and late periods. The trend was only observed for outpatient populations. Conclusions We confirm that there is a trend toward decreasing age among persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, but that these trends seem to be specific to the outpatient population. Overall, this suggests that observed age-related trends are driven by changes in testing patterns rather than true changes in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This calls for caution in interpretation of routine surveillance data until testing patterns stabilize.

J	Gruber, LZ; Ahissar, E				Gruber, Liron Zipora; Ahissar, Ehud			Closed loop motor-sensory dynamics in human vision	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FIXATIONAL EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUAL-STIMULI; MICROSACCADES; RESPONSES; INTEGRATION; SACCADES; ACUITY; MOTION; MONKEY; SPACE	Vision is obtained with a continuous motion of the eyes. The kinematic analysis of eye motion, during any visual or ocular task, typically reveals two (kinematic) components: saccades, which quickly replace the visual content in the retinal fovea, and drifts, which slowly scan the image after each saccade. While the saccadic exchange of regions of interest (ROIs) is commonly considered to be included in motor-sensory closed-loops, it is commonly assumed that drifts function in an open-loop manner, that is, independent of the concurrent visual input. Accordingly, visual perception is assumed to be based on a sequence of open-loop processes, each initiated by a saccade-triggered retinal snapshot. Here we directly challenged this assumption by testing the dependency of drift kinematics on concurrent visual inputs using real-time gaze-contingent-display. Our results demonstrate a dependency of the trajectory on the concurrent visual input, convergence of speed to condition-specific values and maintenance of selected drift-related motor-sensory controlled variables, all strongly indicative of drifts being included in a closed-loop brain-world process, and thus suggesting that vision is inherently a closed-loop process.yy	[Gruber, Liron Zipora; Ahissar, Ehud] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, Rehovot, Israel	Weizmann Institute of Science	Ahissar, E (corresponding author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, Rehovot, Israel.	ehud.ahissar@weizmann.ac.il		Gruber, Liron/0000-0003-1914-6176	European Research Council (ERC) [786949]	European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC))	This research was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 786949).

EID services are hospital-based, and thus fail to capture HIV-exposed infants who are not brought to the hospital for care. Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic systems deployed in the community could increase the proportion tested and linked to treatment, but little feasibility and acceptability data is available. Methods Semi-structured interviews (n = 74) were conducted by a Kenyan team with community members (Community Health Workers/Volunteers [CHW/CHV], Traditional Birth Attendants [TBAs], community leaders) and parents of HIV-exposed infants at four study sites in Kenya to elicit feedback on the acceptability and feasibility of community-based POC HIV testing. Results Participants described existing community health resources that could be leveraged to support integration of community-based POC HIV testing; however, the added demand placed on CHW/CHV could pose a challenge. Participants indicated that other potential barriers (concerns about confidentiality, disclosure, and HIV stigma) could be overcome with strong engagement from trusted community leaders and health providers, community sensitization, and strategic location and timing of testing. These steps were seen to improve acceptability and maximize the recognized benefits (rapid results, improved reach) of community-based testing. Conclusion Community members felt that with strategic planning and engagement, community-based POC HIV testing could be a feasible and acceptable strategy to overcome the existing barriers of hospital-based EID.

Beamforming-based methods, such as the steered response power (SRP), are a common type of acoustic localization methods. However, these methods have low spatial resolution. The SRP method with phase transform (SRP-PHAT) improves the spatial resolution of SRP and is one of the most effective and robust methods for source localization. However, the introduction of a phase transform to SRP might amplify the power of the noise and result in many local extrema in the SRP space, which has a negative impact on source localization. In this paper, a steered sample algorithm (SSA) based on the reciprocity of wave propagation for acoustic source localization is proposed. The SSA localization process is similar to the hyperbolic Radon transform, which is theoretically analyzed and is the most essential difference form the SRP/SRP-PHAT. Compared with the SRP-PHAT, the experimental results demonstrate that the SSA perform better when it comes to array signal positioning with limited array elements and narrow azimuth signal, where SSA can achieve high precision positioning with lower SNR.

Methods A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted which included 132 treatment-naive eyes which underwent Corvis ST. The study cohort comprised of 44 eyes with PXG, 42 eyes with POAG and 46 healthy controls. Corneal biomechanical parameters, which included corneal velocities, length of corneal applanated surface, deformation amplitude (DA), peak distance and radius of curvature, were compared between the groups using analysis of variance models. Results The 3 groups were demographically similar. The mean IOP was 15.7 +/- 3 mmHg in the control group, 21.3 +/- 5 mmHg in the POAG group and 25.8 +/- 7 mmHg in the PXG group (p<0.0001). Corneal pachymetry was similar across the 3 groups. Mean DA was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in the PXG group (0.86 +/- 0.18 mm) compared to the POAG group (0.97 +/- 0.14mm) and the control group (1.10 +/- 0.15mm). Corneal velocities were also found to be statistically significantly different between the groups. However, after adjusting for IOP, there was no difference in any of the biomechanical parameters between the 3 groups. Conclusion Corneal biomechanical parameters measured on Corvis ST are not different between eyes with PXG, POAG and healthy controls after adjusting for IOP.

Automated classification of bacterial cell sub-populations with convolutional neural networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IMAGE-ANALYSIS	Quantification of phenotypic heterogeneity present amongst bacterial cells can be a challenging task. Conventionally, classification and counting of bacteria sub-populations is achieved with manual microscopy, due to the lack of alternative, high-throughput, autonomous approaches. In this work, we apply classification-type convolutional neural networks (cCNN) to classify and enumerate bacterial cell sub-populations (B. subtilis clusters). Here, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the cCNN developed in this study can be as high as 86% when trained on a relatively small dataset (81 images). We also developed a new image preprocessing algorithm, specific to fluorescent microscope images, which increases the amount of training data available for the neural network by 72 times. By summing the classified cells together, the algorithm provides a total cell count which is on parity with manual counting, but is 10.2 times more consistent and 3.8 times faster. Finally, this work presents a complete solution framework for those wishing to learn and implement cCNN in their synthetic biology work.

J	Thomas, R; Spence, MT; Roy, R; Beller, E				Thomas, Rae; Spence, Mark T.; Roy, Rajat; Beller, Elaine			A randomised on-line survey exploring how health condition labels affect behavioural intentions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DECISION; PERCEPTIONS; CANCER; LOCUS	Objectives We examined the effect of 'labels' versus 'descriptions' across four asymptomatic health conditions: pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, mild hyperlipidaemia, and chronic kidney disease stage 3A, on participants' intentions to pursue further tests. There were four secondary objectives: 1) assessing confidence and satisfaction in their intention to test further; 2) revealing psychological drivers affecting intentions; 3) exploring whether intentions, confidence and satisfaction differ by label vs. description and health condition; and 4) producing a perceptual map of illnesses by label condition. Methods Practitioner validated health-related scenarios were used. Two variants of each condition were developed. Participants were recruited through Qualtrics from Australia, Ireland and Canada and randomly assigned two 'labelled' or two 'descriptive' scenarios. Results There was no significant difference in intentions to test between label and description conditions (95% CI -0.76 to 0.33 points, p = 0.4). Confidence and satisfaction were both positively associated with intentions: regression coefficient (beta) for confidence beta = 0.58 points (95% CI 0.49 to 0.68, p < .001) and for satisfaction 0.67 points (95% CI 0.57 to 0.77, p < .001). Predisposition to seek healthcare (beta = 0.72; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.98), attributing illness to bad luck (beta = -0.16 points; 95% CI -0.3 to -0.02), and concern about the health condition (beta = 0.51; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.65) also significantly predicted intentions. Conclusions Unlike studies investigating symptomatic illnesses, the disease label effect on behavioural intentions was not supported suggesting that reducing demand for medical services for borderline cases cannot be achieved by labelling. The average intention to test score was higher in this sample than previous symptomatic health-related studies and there was a positive relationship between increased intentions and confidence/satisfaction in one's decision. Exploratory insights suggested perceptions of the four labelled asymptomatic illnesses all shifted toward greater levels of dread and concern compared to their respective description condition.

High level of HIV false positives using EIA-based algorithm in survey: Importance of confirmatory testing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AG/AB COMBO ASSAY; ELISA; PERFORMANCE; ANTIBODIES; INFECTION; CUTOFF	The Mozambique Indicators of Immunization, Malaria and HIV/AIDS (IMASIDA) survey was conducted in 2015 and used a two Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) (Vironostika HIV-1/2 and Murex HIV-1/2) based algorithm to determine the HIV status of the consented participants. The Mozambique Ministry of Health, with support from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), added Bio-Rad Geenius (TM) HIV-1/2 Supplemental Assay to the IMASIDA HIV testing algorithm to confirm all specimens that were found to be reactive on one or both EIAs. In total 11690 specimens were collected to estimate the proportion of HIV positive samples. Results indicate that the proportion of HIV positive samples based on the concordant positive results of two EIA assays was 21.5% (2518/11690). The addition of the Geenius assay to the IMASIDA HIV testing algorithm demonstrated that 792 (31.5%) of 2518 specimens were false-positive and reduced the proportion of HIV positive samples to 14.7% (1722/11690), demonstrating the importance of including a highly specific HIV test to confirm HIV diagnosis. HIV surveys exclusively based on EIA testing algorithm may result in misleading high prevalence results. Our results demonstrate that more specific confirmatory testing should be added to the EIA-based algorithms to ensure accurate HIV diagnosis and correct HIV prevalence estimate in cross-sectional surveys.

However, few studies have specifically provided specific ranges of temperatures for estimating the maximum abundance of mosquitoes as an empirical basis for climatic dynamics for estimating mosquito-borne infectious disease risks. Methods Adult mosquitoes were collected for three consecutive nights/week using Mosquito Magnet (R) Independence (R) model traps during 2018 and 2019 at US Army Garrison (USAG) Humphreys, Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, Republic of Korea (ROK). An estimate of daily mean temperatures (provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration) were distributed at the maximum abundance for selected species of mosquitoes using daily mosquito collection data after controlling for mosquito ecological cycles and environmental factors. Results Using the Monte-Carlo simulation, the overall mosquito population abundance peaked at 22.7 degrees C (2.5th-97.5(th): 21.7 degrees C-23.8 degrees C).Aedes albopictus, vector of Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever and other viruses, abundance peaked at 24.6 degrees C (2.5th-97.5th, 22.3 degrees C-25.6 degrees C), while Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vectors, e.g.,Culex tritaeniorhynchusandCulex pipiens, peaked at 24.3 degrees C (2.5th-97.5th: 21.9 degrees C-26.3 degrees C) and 22.6 degrees C (2.5th-97.5th: 21.9 degrees C-25.2 degrees C), respectively. Members of theAnophelesHyrcanus Group, some of which are vivax malaria vectors in the ROK, abundance peaked at 22.4 degrees C (2.5th-97.5th: 21.5 degrees C-23.8 degrees C). Conclusion The empirical mean temperature ranges for maximum abundance were determined for each mosquito species collected at USAG Humphreys. These data contributed to the identification of relative mosquito abundance patterns for estimating mosquito-borne disease risks and developing and implementing disease prevention practices.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of the routine two-dose measles containing vaccine (MCV) program in border counties of Southwest China. Methods Data used in the study were derived from a cross-sectional survey among 1,467 children aged 8 to 84 months from five border counties of Yunnan Province, Southwest China in 2016. The participants were recruited using a multistage sampling method. Primary guardians of the children were interviewed to collect information on vaccination history, socio-economic status, and knowledge about immunization. Both coverage and timely coverage for the first (MCV1) and the second (MCV2) dose of MCV were calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was performed to estimate the cumulative coverage of MCV, and Log-rank tests were adopted to compare the differences across counties and birth cohorts. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the predictors of delayed MCV1 vaccination. Results The coverage for MCV1 and MCV2 were 97.5% and 93.4%, respectively. However, only 63.8% and 84.0% of the children received MCV1 or MCV2 on time. Significant differences in the cumulative coverage were detected across counties and birth cohorts. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that children whose primary guardian knew the schedule of MCV were less likely to receive MCV1 late (OR = 0.63, P<0.01). For the guardians, doctors at vaccination units were the primary and also the most desired source of vaccination information. Conclusions Although the coverage for MCV is high in border areas of Southwest China, the timeliness of MCV vaccination seems suboptimal. Tailored information from local health professionals may help to reduce untimely vaccination.

An old soccer wisdom statistically tested	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROSPECT-THEORY; HOT HAND; FOOTBALL	There is an old soccer wisdom that a goal scored just before halftime has greater value than other goals. Many dismiss this old wisdom as just another myth waiting to be busted. To test which is right we have analysed the final score difference through linear regression and outcome (win, draw, loss) through logistic regression. We use games from many leagues, control for the halftime score, comparing games in which a goal was scored after 1 minute remained of regulation time with games in which it was scored before the 44(th)minute. Our main finding is that the home team scoring just before halftime influence these outcomes to its advantage, compared with scoring earlier with the same halftime score. We conclude that a goal scored just before halftime has greater value than other goals provided it is scored by the home team. In other words; the wisdom may be old, but it's still wise.

Therefore, GBS surveillance for better antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis strategies are needed. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical aspects of invasive infections and the phenotypic and genetic diversity of infectious isolates from Nara, Japan, collected between 2007 and 2016, by using information from hospital records. GBS strains collected from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were evaluated for capsular types, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), antibiotic susceptibility, antibiotics resistance gene, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Forty GBS isolates (10 from children and 30 from adults) were analyzed, and the distribution of molecular serotype and allelic profiles varied between children and adults. We found the rates of early-onset disease in neonates with birth complications to be higher than that of previous reports, indicating that there could be relevance between complications at birth and early-onset disease. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis strategies may need to be reconsidered in patients with birth complications. In adults, the mean age of the patients was 68 years (male: 63%). Primary bacteremia was the most common source of infection. In the neonates, six had early-onset diseases and four had late-onset diseases. The most frequently identified strains were molecular serotype Ia ST23 (40%) and molecular serotype Ib ST10 (20%) in children and molecular serotype Ib ST10 (17%), molecular serotype VI ST1 (13%), and molecular serotype V ST1 (13%) in adults. Levofloxacin-resistant molecular serotype Ib strains and molecular serotypes V and VI ST1 were common causes of GBS infection in adults but were rarely found in children. Furthermore, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in our study showed that specific clone isolates, that tend to have antibiotics resistance were widespread horizontally for a decade. Continuous surveillance and molecular investigation are warranted to identify the transmission route and improve antibiotic treatment strategies.

J	Huang, DQ; Lang, Y; Liu, T				Huang, Daquan; Lang, Yue; Liu, Tao			Evolving population distribution in China's border regions: Spatial differences, driving forces and policy implications	PLOS ONE			English	Article							URBANIZATION; PATTERN	The security and socioeconomic development of China's border areas are of great significance to the nation and the wider world. Using census, statistical, digital elevation model (DEM) and network data, this paper employs visual analysis to capture population distribution patterns in China's 131 border counties from 1982 to 2010. Multiple stepwise regression is carried out to identify the influencing factors of population dynamics in border regions. The main findings include: China's most heavily populated border areas are primarily in the northeast, northwest, and the Guangxi-Yunnan region, while rapid growth of population is found in western Inner Mongolia, southwest Xinjiang, northwest Tibet, and southern Yunnan. Given the increasingly market-oriented migration mechanism, the national reclamation policy has been no longer effective in population attraction in the new century. Education has significantly lowered and will continuously lower the fertility rate in remote border areas. The factors influencing population growth show a remarkable regional heterogeneity along China's long border.

PCNA antagonizes cohesin-dependent roles in genomic stability	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SISTER-CHROMATID COHESION; DNA-REPLICATION; S-PHASE; BUDDING YEAST; CHROMOSOME CONDENSATION; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION; REMODELING COMPLEX; TELOMERE LENGTH; WAPL CONTROLS; ESTABLISHMENT	PCNA sliding clamp binds factors through which histone deposition, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair are coupled to DNA replication. PCNA also directly binds Eco1/Ctf7 acetyltransferase, which in turn activates cohesins and establishes cohesion between nascent sister chromatids. While increased recruitment thus explains the mechanism through which elevated levels of chromatin-bound PCNA rescueeco1mutant cell growth, the mechanism through which PCNA instead worsens cohesin mutant cell growth remains unknown. Possibilities include that elevated levels of long-lived chromatin-bound PCNA reduce either cohesin deposition onto DNA or cohesin acetylation. Instead, our results reveal that PCNA increases the levels of both chromatin-bound cohesin and cohesin acetylation. Beyond sister chromatid cohesion, PCNA also plays a critical role in genomic stability such that high levels of chromatin-bound PCNA elevate genotoxic sensitivities and recombination rates. At a relatively modest increase of chromatin-bound PCNA, however, fork stability and progression appear normal in wildtype cells. Our results reveal that even a moderate increase of PCNA indeed sensitizes cohesin mutant cells to DNA damaging agents and in a process that involves the DNA damage response kinase Mec1(ATR), but not Tel1(ATM). These and other findings suggest that PCNA mis-regulation results in genome instabilities that normally are resolved by cohesin. Elevating levels of chromatin-bound PCNA may thus help target cohesinopathic cells linked that are linked to cancer.

Predicting hypertension using machine learning: Findings from Qatar Biobank Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BLOOD-PRESSURE; DECISION TREE; DISEASE; RISK; HEALTH; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; REDUCTION; PREVENT; OBESITY	Background and objective Hypertension, a global burden, is associated with several risk factors and can be treated by lifestyle modifications and medications. Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18(+)years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis. Results Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother's history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC's equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively. Conclusions Machine learning provides the chance of having a rapid predictive model using non-invasive predictors to screen for hypertension. Future research should consider improving the predictive accuracy of models in larger general populations, including more important predictors and using a variety of algorithms.

African Americans and Hispanics have significantly lower vaccination rates, and large-scale campaigns have had difficulty increasing vaccination among these two groups. This study assessed the feasibility of delivering a flu vaccination promotion campaign using influencers, and examined shifts in social norms regarding flu vaccine acceptability after a social media micro influencer campaign. Influencers were asked to choose from vetted messages and create their own original content promoting flu vaccination, which was posted to their social media pages. Content was intentionally unbranded to ensure that it aligned with the look and feel of their pages. Cross-sectional pre- and post-campaign surveys were conducted within regions that received the campaign and control regions to examine potential campaign impact. Digital metrics assessed campaign exposure. Overall, 117 influencers generated 69,495 engagements. Results from the region that received the campaign showed significant increases in positive beliefs about the flu vaccine, and significant decreases in negative community attitudes toward the vaccine. This study suggests that flu campaigns using a ground-up rather than top-down approach can feasibly reach at-risk groups with lower vaccination rates, and shows the potentials of using an influencer-based model to communicate information about flu vaccination on a large scale.

Perceived barriers and benefits of implementing HIV care at the community level in Tshwane district: A qualitative study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ADHERENCE; AFRICA	Little is known about the barriers and benefits of home-based HIV services offered by community health workers. These are especially important as the South African government embarks on scaling up community-based health services, which include HIV care. This study set out to understand potential benefits and barriers of these services in Tshwane district and develop recommendations for improvement. From June to August 2019, seven focus group discussions were conducted with 58 participants: four with 36 ward-based outreach team (WBOT) members and three with 22 people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Three aspects of care were explored: 1. Experience of performing, receiving or observing home-based HIV care; 2. Barriers to conducting home visits; and 3. The perceived value of WBOTs and home-based HIV care. While home-based HIV care was seen as a support strategy which could motivate patients to take their medication, the unpredictability of patients' responses to HIV test results, incorrect addresses (driven by the need for identity documents), fear of stigma through association with WBOTs, especially those in uniform, little or no preparation of patients for home-based care, and lack of confidentiality and trust were raised as potential barriers. To successfully implement effective home-based HIV care in South Africa, perceived barriers should be addressed and recommendations offered by people providing and receiving these services should be seriously considered. Pertinent recommendations include integrating WBOTs into clinics and existing support structures, improving training on confidentiality and HIV testing, and rethinking the recruitment, scope of work and safety of WBOTs.

Exposure to small molecule cocktails allows induction of neural crest lineage cells from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURONAL CELLS; DIFFERENTIATION; FIBROBLASTS; GENERATION; IDENTIFICATION; PROLIFERATION; MECHANISMS; EXPRESSION; ALZHEIMERS; CCR3	Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a promising source for cell therapy and regenerative medicine owing to their multipotency, self-renewability, and capability to secrete various trophic factors. However, isolating NCCs from adult organs is challenging, because NCCs are broadly distributed throughout the body. Hence, we attempted to directly induce NCCs from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), which can be isolated easily, using small molecule cocktails. We established a controlled induction protocol with two-step application of small molecule cocktails for 6 days. The induction efficiency was evaluated based on mRNA and protein expression of neural crest markers, such as nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10). We also found that various trophic factors were significantly upregulated following treatment with the small molecule cocktails. Therefore, we performed global profiling of cell surface makers and identified distinctly upregulated markers, including the neural crest-specific cell surface markers CD271 and CD57. These results indicate that our chemical treatment can direct human ADSCs to developing into the neural crest lineage. This offers a promising experimental platform to study human NCCs for applications in cell therapy and regenerative medicine.

J	Balint, L; Fuzer, K; Gonda, X; Dome, P				Balint, Lajos; Fuzer, Katalin; Gonda, Xenia; Dome, Peter			Estimation of the relationship between the persistent decrease of the suicide rate and the changes in sociodemographic composition in Hungary between 1990 and 2011	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPLETED SUICIDE; MARITAL-STATUS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SOVIET-UNION; MORTALITY; EDUCATION; STANDARDIZATION; DECOMPOSITION; INTEGRATION; ALCOHOL	From the end of the 1980s, the Hungarian suicide rate, which had been until that point the highest in the world for decades, has decreased drastically. The reason behind this decrease was probably due to the changes in numerous and often interlinked risk factors. Studies on this topic have mostly ignored to interrogate to what extent the change of the population composition, for example the improvement of educational level, contributed to the decrease of the rate in the given period? Our aim was to assess the contribution of changes in some sociodemographic factors to the decrease of the suicide rate in Hungary. During the analysis, data from 1990 were compared with data from 2011. For the statistical calculations, the method of "Standardization and Decomposition (SDA)" was used, which according to our best knowledge, has not yet been applied in Hungarian suicide studies. The results show that the improvement of educational level helped to decrease the rate for men by about a third, while for women only by about a tenth. However, the benefit of the improvement in educational attainment during the period investigated was significantly offset by the changes primarily in marital status (the ratios of unmarried and divorced subjects increased for both genders) and in age distribution (the ratio of the elderly persons increased for both genders). The results of our study emphasise the inverse relationship between suicide and educational level and support the hypothesis that we can regard educational policy as indirect health policy.

Exploring issues surrounding mental health and wellbeing across two continents: A preliminary cross-sectional collaborative study between the University of California, Davis, and University of Pretoria	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STRESS REDUCTION; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; INVENTORY; STUDENTS; IMPACT; LIFE	Mental health and wellness research continue to be a topic of importance among veterinary students in the United States of America (US). Limited peer reviewed literature focusing on South African veterinary students is available. South African veterinary medical students might benefit from approaches to improve mental health and wellness similar to those recommended in the US. However, these recommendations may not address the underlying risk factors for mental health and wellness concerns or mismatch resources available to South African veterinary medical students. The purpose of this collaborative study was to compare the mental health and wellness among veterinary students enrolled at the University of California, Davis (UCD), and the University of Pretoria (UP), the only veterinary school in South Africa. Our primary research question was; Are the measures of mental health and wellness for students at similar stages in the veterinary curriculum different between the two schools? We hypothesized that mental health and wellness as determined by assessment of anxiety, burnout, depression, and quality of life between the two schools is different. A cross-sectional study of 102 students from UCD and 74 students from UP, at similar preclinical stages (Year 2 for UCD and Year 4 for UP) of the veterinary curriculum was performed. Anxiety, burnout, depression, and quality of life were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Short Form-8 (SF-8), respectively. Students from both schools had moderate levels of anxiety, high levels of burnout, mild to moderate levels of depression, poor mental health, and good physical health. Our results suggest that similar mental health and wellness concerns in South African veterinary students is comparable with concerns in veterinary medical students in the US. Recommendations and resources to improve mental health and wellness in US veterinary medical students might be applicable to South African veterinary medical students.

Frequency of mental health symptoms stratified by demographic factors was also explored. We hypothesized social health would mediate and/or moderate the relationship between physical and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Methods This cross-sectional study includes 598 adults between 18 and 75 years old recruited from three health centers in the city of Irbid, Jordan, 20 km away from the Syrian border. Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were measured through the primary care post-traumatic stress disorder checklist. Physical and social health were assessed through the Duke Health Profile. One-way ANOVA and independent samples T-tests examined mean scores of social health, PTSS, physical health stratified by age, gender, nationality, education level, and trauma exposure. Bivariate correlations explored the relationship between social health, PTSS, and physical health. PROCESS macro tested social health as a moderator and mediator on the association of the physical health and PTSS. Results Social health moderated and mediated the relationship between physical health and PTSS. Males reported (t = 2.53, p < .05) better physical health scores than females. Those who had less than a high school education reported lower social health (F = 13.83, p < .001); higher PTSS (F = 5.83, p < .001); and lower physical health (F = 5.76, p < .01) than more educated individuals. Syrians reported significantly higher PTSS (F = 4.13, p < .05) than Jordanians, however, there was no significant differences between nationality for physical or social health. Social health was positively associated with better physical health (r = 0.10, p < .01) and negatively with PTSS (r = -.293, p < .01). Conclusions Our results support our primary hypothesis suggesting social health mediates and moderates PTSS and physical health. Secondary findings illustrate gender, educational, and income differences in physical health and PTSS.

J	Roy, S; Ghosh, P				Roy, Satyaki; Ghosh, Preetam			Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background After claiming nearly five hundred thousand lives globally, the COVID-19 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down. While the UK, USA, Brazil and parts of Asia are bracing themselves for the second wave-or the extension of the first wave-it is imperative to identify the primary social, economic, environmental, demographic, ethnic, cultural and health factors contributing towards COVID-19 infection and mortality numbers to facilitate mitigation and control measures. Methods We process several open-access datasets on US states to create an integrated dataset of potential factors leading to the pandemic spread. We then apply several supervised machine learning approaches to reach a consensus as well as rank the key factors. We carry out regression analysis to pinpoint the key pre-lockdown factors that affect post-lockdown infection and mortality, informing future lockdown-related policy making. Findings Population density, testing numbers and airport traffic emerge as the most discriminatory factors, followed by higher age groups (above 40 and specifically 60+). Post-lockdown infected and death rates are highly influenced by their pre-lockdown counterparts, followed by population density and airport traffic. While healthcare index seems uncorrelated with mortality rate, principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) experiencing strong second wave or peaking late in rate of infection and death. Finally, a small case study on New York City shows that days-to-peak for infection of neighboring boroughs correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the inter-zone distance. Interpretation States forming the early hotspots are regions with high airport or road traffic resulting in human interaction. US states with high population density and testing tend to exhibit consistently high infected and death numbers. Mortality rate seems to be driven by individual physiology, preexisting condition, age etc., rather than gender, healthcare facility or ethnic predisposition. Finally, policymaking on the timing of lockdowns should primarily consider the pre-lockdown infected numbers along with population density and airport traffic.

J	Thorp, JE; Adamczyk, PG				Thorp, Jenna E.; Adamczyk, Peter Gabriel			Mechanisms of gait phase entrainment in healthy subjects during rhythmic electrical stimulation of the medial gastrocnemius	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTROMECHANICAL DELAY; STEP FREQUENCY; WALKING; MUSCLE; VARIABILITY; ORTHOSIS	Studies have shown that human gait entrains to rhythmic bursts of ankle torque for perturbation intervals both slightly shorter and slightly longer than the natural stride period while walking on a treadmill and during overground walking, with phase alignment such that the torque adds to ankle push-off. This study investigated whether human gait also entrains to align the phase of rhythmic electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle with the timing of ankle push-off. In addition, this study investigated the muscle response to electrical stimulation at different phases of the gait cycle. We found that for both treadmill and overground walking entrainment was observed with phasing that aligned the stimuli with ankle push-off or just before foot contact. Achilles tendon wave speed measurements showed a significant difference (increase) in tendon load when electrical stimulation was applied just after foot contact and during swing phase, with a greater increase for higher amplitudes of electrical stimulation. However, stimulation did not increase tendon load when the timing coincided with push-off. Stride period measurements also suggest the effect of electrical stimulation is sensitive to the gait phase it is applied. These results confirmed that timing aligned with push-off is an attractor for electrical stimulation-induced perturbations of the medial gastrocnemius, and that the muscle response to stimulation is sensitive to timing and amplitude. Future research should investigate other muscles and timings and separate sensory vs. motor contributions to these phenomena.

J	Yu, QZ; Li, B				Yu, Qingzhao; Li, Bin			Third-variable effect analysis with multilevel additive models	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEDIATION ANALYSIS; LINEAR-MODELS	Third-variable effect refers to the effect transmitted by third-variables that intervene in the relationship between an exposure and a response variable. Third-variable effect analysis has been broadly studied in many fields. However, it remains a challenge for researchers to differentiate indirect effect of individual factor from multiple third-variables, especially when the involving variables are of hierarchical structure. Yu et al. (2014) defined third-variable effects that were consistent for all different types of response (categorical or continuous), exposure, or third-variables. With these definitions, multiple third-variables can be considered simultaneously, and the indirect effects carried by individual third-variables can be separated from the total effect. In this paper, we extend the definitions of third-variable effects to multilevel data structures, where multilevel additive models are adapted to model the variable relationships. And then third-variable effects can be estimated at different levels. Moreover, transformations on variables are allowed to present nonlinear relationships among variables. We compile an R package mlma, to carry out the proposed multilevel third-variable analysis. Simulations show that the proposed method can effectively differentiate and estimate third-variable effects from different levels. Further, we implement the method to explore the racial disparity in body mass index accounting for both environmental and individual level risk factors.

PLHIV aged >= 50 years old and on ART since >= 6 months were included (N = 333) from three clinics (two in Cote d'Ivoire, one in Senegal) participating in the International epidemiological Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) West Africa collaboration. Physical function was measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the unipodal balance test and self-reported questionnaires. Grip strength was also assessed. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with SPPB performance specifically. Median age was 57 (54-61) years, 57.7% were female and 82.7% had an undetectable viral load. The mean SPPB score was 10.2 +/- 1.8. Almost 30% had low SPPB performance with the 5-sit-to-stand test being the most altered subtest (64%). PLHIV with low SPPB performance also had significantly low performance on the unipodal balance test (54.2%, p = 0.001) and low mean grip strength (but only in men (p = 0.005)). They also showed some difficulties in daily life activities (climbing stairs, walking one block, both p<0.0001). Age >= 60 years (adjusted OR (aOR) = 3.4; CI95% = 1.9-5.9,), being a female (aOR = 2.1; CI95% = 1.1-4.1), having an abdominal obesity (aOR = 2.1; CI95% =1.2-4.0), a longer duration of HIV infection (aOR = 2.9; CI95% = 1.5-5.7), old Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (i.e., AZT: zidovudine, ddI: didanosine, DDC: zalcitabine, D4T: stavudine) in current ART (aOR = 2.0 CI95% = 1.1-3.7) were associated with low SPPB performance. As in western countries, physical function limitation is now part of the burden of HIV disease complications of older PLHIV living in West Africa, putting this population at risk for disability. How to screen those impairments and integrate their management in the standards of care should be investigated, and specific research on developing adapted daily physical activity program might be conducted.

We used logistic regressions to identify characteristics associated with the use of ATG or BSX. Results Use of ATG between the centers ranged from 41% to 75%. We observed different factors associated with the treatment decision. Compared to a first transplant, performing a second graft was the only factor significantly associated with the choice of ATG in all centers. The AUC ranged from 0.67 to 0.91, indicating that the centers seemed to define their own rules. As a result, for patients with the same low immunological risk, the probability of receiving ATG varied from 7% to 36%. We stratified the analyses according to two periods, from 2013 to 2015 and from 2016 to 2019. A similar heterogeneity was observed, and in some cases ATG indications between the centers were inverted. Conclusions The heterogeneity of induction therapy practices did not decrease in France, even if the reated literature is prolific. This illustrates the necessity to improve the literature by using meta-analyses of recent studies stratified by graft and patient profiles.

J	Mohammed, S; Larsen-Reindorf, RE				Mohammed, Shamsudeen; Larsen-Reindorf, Roderick Emil			Menstrual knowledge, sociocultural restrictions, and barriers to menstrual hygiene management in Ghana: Evidence from a multi-method survey among adolescent schoolgirls and schoolboys	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GIRLS	On a daily basis, schoolgirls in low and middle-income countries discover blood on their clothing for the first time in school environments without toilets, water, or a supportive teacher, mentor, or role model to help them understand the changes happening in their bodies. This study aimed to examine the menstrual knowledge, sociocultural restrictions, and barriers to menstrual hygiene management in school environment among adolescent schoolgirls in a rural community. We collected quantitative data from 250 adolescent schoolgirls and qualitative data from thirty schoolboys and five schoolteachers in five Junior High Schools in the Kumbungu district of northern Ghana. Binary logistic regression models were fitted to determine the predictors of poor menstrual knowledge. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim, coded, and organized into themes. Overall, 53.6% of the girls had poor knowledge about menstruation. Most of the boys had heard about menstruation and had an idea about what menstruation is with most of them describing it as "the flow of blood through the vagina of a female." The boys revealed that terms such as "Vodafone," "Red card," and "Palm oil" are used to describe menstruation in the schools and within the community. After adjusting for the effect of other sociodemographic factors, we found evidence that girls in their late adolescents were less likely to have poor menstrual knowledge compared to those aged 10-14 years (aOR 0.20, 95%CI 0.08-0.48). Maternal education was protective against poor menstrual knowledge. When compared to adolescents whose mothers were illiterates, those whose mothers had basic education (aOR 0.62, 95%CI 0.28-1.40) and those whose mothers had secondary or higher education (AOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.06-0.76) were less likely to have poor knowledge about menstruation. Adolescents from homes with no television and radio sets were more likely to have poor menstrual knowledge compared to those from homes with television and radio sets (aOR 2.42, 95%CI 1.41-4.15). Comfort, safety, and cost were the major factors that influenced their choice of sanitary products. Most of the teachers said the schools do not provide students with sanitary products, even in emergencies. We found that girls were not to prepare some local dishes (e.g.Wasawasa) during their periods and are forbidden from participating in religious activities (i.e. read the Holy Quran or pray in the mosque) during the period of menstruation. Open discussions about menstruation and its management are not encouraged and girls are considered unclean and impure during the period of menstruation. None of the schools had a regular supply of water in WASH facilities, a mirror for girls to check their uniforms for bloodstains or soap in the toilet facilities for handwashing. Menstrual education through the standard school curriculum, starting from primary school, could prepare girls for menarche, improve their knowledge on menstruation, and teach boys how to support girls and women during the period of menstruation. This could also eliminate the sociocultural misconceptions surrounding menstruation.

During the last years, models regarding cancer cell intravasation have been proposed, such as the "endocanalicular transendothelial crossing" (ETC) theory. This theory describes the interplay between two adjacent endothelial cells and the TCi or a leukocyte during intravasation. Two endothelial cells create a channel with their cell membranes, in which the cell fits in without involving endothelial cell intercellular junctions, reaching the lumen through a transendothelial passage. In the present study, ten SCID mice were subcutaneously xenotransplanted with the HEK-EBNA293-VEGF-D cell line and euthanized after 35 days. Post-mortem examinations were performed and proper specimens from tumors were collected. Routine histology and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, pAKT, pERK, ZEB-1, TWIST-1, F-actin, E-cadherin and LYVE-1 were performed followed by ultrastructural serial sections analysis. A novel experimental approach involving Computed Tomography (CT) combined with 3D digital model reconstruction was employed. The analysis of activated transcription factors supports that tumor cells at the periphery potentially underwent an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process. Topographical analysis of LYVE-1 immunolabeled lymphatics revealed a peritumoral localisation. TEM investigations of the lymphatic vessels combined with 3D digital modelling enhanced the understanding of the endotheliocytes behavior during TCi intravasation, clarifying the ETC theory. Serial ultrastructural analysis performed within tumor periphery revealed numerous cells during the ETC process. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that ETC is an intravasation mode more frequently used by the TCi than by leukocytes during intravasation in the HEK-EBNA293-VEGF-D xenograft model and lays down the potential basis for promising future studies regarding intravasation blocking therapy.

The hunger-obesity paradox: Exploring food banking system characteristics and obesity inequities among food-insecure pantry clients	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT; COPING STRATEGIES; DIETARY QUALITY; EMERGENCY FOOD; HEALTH; OVERWEIGHT; SECURITY; INTERVENTION; PREFERENCES	Purpose Heightened obesity risk among food-insecure food pantry clients is a health equity issue because the co-occurrence of obesity and hunger is deeply-rooted in systematic social disadvantage and historical oppression. This qualitative study examined key stakeholders' perspectives of the relationship between the U.S. food banking system and obesity disparities among food insecure clients. Methods We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 10 key stakeholders (e.g., food bank director, food bank board member, advocate) who are familiar with food bank operations. Data were transcribed verbatim, coded in NVivo [v11], and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Multiple themes emerged drawing linkages betweenstructural characteristicsof the food banking system and disparities in the dual burden of food insecurity and obesity: [a] access to unhealthy food from donors; [b] federal emergency food policy and programming; [c] state-level emergency food policy and programming; [d] geography-based risk profiles; and [e] inadequate food supply versus client need. Interviewees also identifiedsocialchallenges between system leaders and clients that maintain disparities in obesity risk among individuals with very low food security including: [a] media representation and stereotypes about food pantry clients; [b] mistrust in communities of color; [c] lack of inclusion/representation among food bank system leaders; and [d] access to information. Conclusion Future efforts to alleviate obesity inequities among clients chronically burdened by food insecurity, especially among certain subpopulations of clients, should prioritize policy, systems, and environmental strategies to overcome thesestructuralandsocialchallenges within the food banking system.

It is remarkable publications about malaria in the Amazon, although information on malaria in indigenous populations is still poorly explored. Objective Identify factors associated with malaria in indigenous populations. Methods Cross-sectional study of positive cases of malaria in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, from 2007 to 2016. Secondary data were obtained from the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System for Malaria and from the Mortality Information System, both from Brazil. To tackle with race missing data, cases with no race fulfilled were classified according to the probable location where infection occurred. This way, was imputed indigenous race for those which the probable infection location was indigenous village (aldeia). Variables tested with race were: sex, age, schooling, microscope surveillance slide type, parasitic infection species, parasitemia level, and timeliness of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used. Results A total of 1,055,852 cases of malaria were notified in the state of Amazonas. Among the factors that associate malaria and indigenous peoples, the most significant were sex, children and high levels of parasitemia. The magnitude ofPlasmodium vivaxinfection is higher thanPlasmodium falciparum, although this parasite was more frequent in indigenous than other races. In regards to mortality, 109 deaths were registered, most of them related toP.vivax. Conclusion The findings underscore the importance of look at indigenous people differently of other races. The associated factors highlight a profile of cases severity, because of highest parasitemia, many cases ofP.falciparumalthough high frequency ofP.vivax, and children. Furthermore, the mortality in indigenous, specially in older people is worrying	[Meireles, Bruna Martins; Goncalves, Maria Jacirema Ferreira] Univ Fed Amazonas, Escola Enfermagem Manaus, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [de Souza Sampaio, Vanderson; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo] Fundacao Med Trop Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [de Souza Sampaio, Vanderson; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo] Univ Estado Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [de Souza Sampaio, Vanderson] Fundacao Vigilancia Saude Estado Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Goncalves, Maria Jacirema Ferreira] Fiocruz MS, Inst Leonidas & Maria Deane, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Goncalves, Maria Jacirema Ferreira] Univ Fed Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil	Universidade Federal de Amazonas; Universidade do Estado do Amazonas; Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz; Universidade Federal de Amazonas	Goncalves, MJF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amazonas, Escola Enfermagem Manaus, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.; Goncalves, MJF (corresponding author), Fiocruz MS, Inst Leonidas & Maria Deane, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.; Goncalves, MJF (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amazonas, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.	jaciremagoncalves@gmail.com	Sampaio, Vanderson/M-4337-2015	Sampaio, Vanderson/0000-0001-7307-8851; Goncalves, Maria Jacirema/0000-0002-8460-8501	Amazonas State Research Support Foundation - Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (PAPAC/FAPEAM)	Amazonas State Research Support Foundation - Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (PAPAC/FAPEAM)	Program to support the scientific publication article by the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation - Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (PAPAC/FAPEAM).

J	Djimeu, EW; Heard, A				Djimeu, Eric W.; Heard, Anna			Replication of influential studies on biomedical, social, behavioural and structural interventions for HIV prevention and treatment	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Replication is an important tool to promote high quality research and ensure policy makers can rely on studies in making guidelines or funding programs. By ensuring influential studies are replicable we provide assurance that the policies based on these studies are well-founded and the conclusions and recommendations are robust-to different estimation models or different choices. In this paper, we argue that replication is not only useful but necessary to ensure that an author's choice in how to analyse data is not the only factor that determines whether an intervention is effective or not. We also show that while most research is done well and provides robust results, small differences can lead to different interpretations and these differences need to be acknowledged. This special issue highlights 5 such replication studies, which are replications of influential studies on biomedical, social, behavioural and structural interventions for HIV prevention and treatment. We reflect on their findings. Four out of five studies, which conduct push button replication and pure replication, were able to reproduce the results of the original studies with minor differences, mainly due to minor typographical errors or rounding differences. The analysis of the measurement and estimation analyses conducted in these five studies reveals that the original results are not very robust to alternative analytical approaches, especially when these results rely on a small number of observations. In these cases, the original results are weakened. Furthermore, in contrast to the original papers, two of the five included replication studies conducted a theory of change analysis-to explore how or why the interventions work (or do not) not just whether the intervention works or not. These two analyses indicate that the estimated impacts of the interventions are drawn from few mediators. In addition, they demonstrate that, in some cases, a lack of effect may be related to lack of adequate exposure to the intervention rather than inefficacy of the interventionper se. However, overall, the included replication studies show that the results presented in the original papers are trustworthy and robust, especially when based on larger sample sizes. Replication studies can not only verify the results of a study, they can also provide additional insights on the published results, such as how and why an intervention was effective or less effective than expected. They can thus be a tool to inform the research community and/ or policymakers about whether and how interventions could be adopted, which need to be tested further, and which should be discontinued because of their ineffectiveness. Thus, publishing these replication studies in peer-reviewed journals makes the work public and publicized. The work advances knowledge, and publication should be encouraged, as it is for other types of research.

Predicting overdose among individuals prescribed opioids using routinely collected healthcare utilization data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; ECONOMIC BURDEN; DEATHS; MODELS; ABUSE; REGULARIZATION; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; CODES	Introduction With increasing rates of opioid overdoses in the US, a surveillance tool to identify high-risk patients may help facilitate early intervention. Objective To develop an algorithm to predict overdose using routinely-collected healthcare databases. Methods Within a US commercial claims database (2011-2015), patients with >= 1 opioid prescription were identified. Patients were randomly allocated into the training (50%), validation (25%), or test set (25%). For each month of follow-up, pooled logistic regression was used to predict the odds of incident overdose in the next month based on patient history from the preceding 3-6 months (time-updated), using elastic net for variable selection. As secondary analyses, we explored whether using simpler models (few predictors, baseline only) or different analytic methods (random forest, traditional regression) influenced performance. Results We identified 5,293,880 individuals prescribed opioids; 2,682 patients (0.05%) had an overdose during follow-up (mean: 17.1 months). On average, patients who overdosed were younger and had more diagnoses and prescriptions. The elastic net model achieved good performance (c-statistic 0.887, 95% CI 0.872-0.902; sensitivity 80.2, specificity 80.1, PPV 0.21, NPV 99.9 at optimal cutpoint). It outperformed simpler models based on few predictors (c-statistic 0.825, 95% CI 0.808-0.843) and baseline predictors only (c-statistic 0.806, 95% CI 0.787-0.26). Different analytic techniques did not substantially influence performance. In the final algorithm based on elastic net, the strongest predictors were age 18-25 years (OR: 2.21), prior suicide attempt (OR: 3.68), opioid dependence (OR: 3.14). Conclusions We demonstrate that sophisticated algorithms using healthcare databases can be predictive of overdose, creating opportunities for active monitoring and early intervention.

We also wanted to find the gender, setting, and region-wide distribution of MS in India. Methods We conducted systematic searches in various databases including Medline, ScienceDirect, Cochrane library and Google Scholar from inception until August 2019. We included studies conducted in India reporting the prevalence of MS among adults aged 18 years or more. We used the Newcastle Ottawa scale to assess the quality of included studies. We carried out a meta-analysis with random-effects model and reported pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Funnel plot to assess publication biases. Results In total, we analysed 113 data from 111 studies with 133,926 participants. Majority of the included studies (76 out of 111) had low risk of bias. We found significant heterogeneity among the included studies (p<0.001). We also found a symmetrical funnel plot indicating an absence of publication bias. The prevalence of MS among adult population in India was 30% (95%CI: 28%-33%). There was a steady increase in the burden across the age groups from 13% (18-29 years group) to 50% (50-59 years). We also found that people living in urban areas (32%; 95%CI: 29%-36%) had higher prevalence when compared to tribal (28%; 95%CI: 21%-36%) or rural adults (22%; 95%CI: 20%-25%). Gender distribution of MS showed that the females had higher prevalence (35%; 95%CI: 31%-38%) when compared to males 26% (95%CI: 22%-29%). Conclusion Almost one in three adults in India suffer from MS. Females, people living in urban areas and in northeast region had higher prevalence of MS. Development and implementation of policies and protocols for the screening of MS would enable us in early diagnosis and treatment with special focus towards the vulnerable and high-risk groups.

However, uptake is low among people living with multiple sclerosis (MS) and little is known about why or how people with MS engage in this process of decision-making. Aims To develop and refine an initial theory on engagement in ACP for people with MS and to identify ways to improve its uptake for those who desire it. Methods Realist review following published protocol and reporting following Realist and Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) guidelines. A multi-disciplinary team searched MEDLINE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar in addition to other sources from inception to August 2019. Quantitative or qualitative studies, case reports, and opinion or discussion articles related to ACP and/or end of life discussions in the context of MS were included, as well as one article on physical disability and one on motor neuron disease, that contributed important contextual information. Researchers independently screened abstracts and extracted data from full-text articles. Using abductive and retroductive analysis, each article was examined for evidence to support or refute 'context, mechanism, and outcome' (CMO) hypotheses, using the Integrated Behaviour Model to guide theory development. Quality was assessed according to methodological rigour and relevance of evidence. Those studies providing rich descriptions were synthesised using a realist matrix to identify commonalities across CMO configurations. Results Of the 4,034 articles identified, 33 articles were included in the synthesis that supported six CMO hypotheses that identified contexts and mechanisms underpinning engagement in ACP for people with MS and included: acceptance of their situation, prior experiences, confidence, empowerment, fear (of being a burden, of death and of dying) and the desire for autonomy. Acceptance of self as a person with a life-limiting illness was imperative as it enabled people with MS to see ACP as pertinent to them. We identified the context of MS-its long, uncertain disease trajectory with periods of stability punctuated by crisis-inhibited triggering of mechanisms. Similarly, the absence of skills and confidence in advanced communication skills among health professionals prevented possibilities for ACP discussions taking place. Conclusion Although mechanisms are inhibited by the context of MS, health professionals can facilitate greater uptake of ACP among those people with MS who want it by developing their skills in communication, building trusting relationships, sharing accurate prognostic information and sensitively discussing death and dying.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between sexual minority status and suicidality in a multinational sample of European school pupils. Methods A self-report questionnaire was delivered to 2046 adolescents (mean age 15.34 +/- 1.01; 56.3% females) recruited from 27 randomly selected schools in 6 European countries. Suicidal ideation, measured with the Paykel Suicide Scale (PSS), and lifetime suicide attempts were compared between heterosexual and sexual minority (i.e. those with a non-heterosexual orientation) youth. Poisson regression analyses studied the longitudinal association between sexual minority status and the rate of serious suicidal ideation, measured at three time-points during a 4-month period. Several variables, including alcohol and illegal drugs use, bullying, family interaction, school-related stress, economic status, and religiosity, were included in multivariable analysis. Sex-stratified analyses evaluated the association respectively among females and males. Results Of 1958 pupils included in analysis (mean age 15.35 +/- 1.00; females 56.8%), 214 (10.9%) were categorized as sexual minority youth (SMY). When compared to heterosexual youth (HSY), SMY were significantly more exposed to substance abuse, bullying, school-related stress, and lower economic status. SMY pupils had significantly higher suicidal ideation scores (p<0.001; r 0.145) as well as higher prevalence of serious suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR] 2.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83-3.79) and previous suicide attempts (OR 2.72, 95%CI 1.77-4.18), compared to their HSY peers. The rate of serious suicidal ideation reports during the study was significantly higher among SMY compared to HSY (rate ratio [RR] 2.55, 95%CI 1.90-3.43). A significant difference was found even when controlling for the pupils' country as well as after adjustment for alcohol and illegal drugs use, bullying, family interaction, school-related stress, economic status, and religiosity (adjusted RR 1.73, 95%CI 1.23-2.48). Stratified analyses showed significant associations between SMY status and persistent serious suicidal ideation for both sexes, with a notably strong association among male pupils (females aRR 1.51, 95%CI 1.01-2.24; males aRR 3.84, 95%CI 1.94-7.59). Conclusions European sexual minority youth are a high-risk group for suicidality, independently from objective factors such as victimization or substance abuse. There is a need to develop primary and secondary preventive measures for sexual minority youth, including the management of context vulnerabilities and related distal stressors, before the establishment of proximal stressors. Context-targeting interventions may effectively focus on social and economic factors, as well as on the potentially different risk profile of female and male sexual minority youth.

Confronted with this challenge, vector control staff must understand insecticide resistance management, think comprehensively and react positively when confronted with new problems. However, information on the subject is often only available through written guidelines that are difficult to put into practice. Based on the successes and strengths of educational games for health, we developed and evaluated a novel game-based course to fill the gap in training resources for insecticide resistance management. The training was evaluated by analysing results of pre- and post-course knowledge tests and self-efficacy surveys, as well as post-course interviews. At the start of the training, fundamental concepts of insecticide resistance were reviewed through Resistance101, a mobile app game. Subsequently, insecticide resistance management strategies were explored using the simulation game ResistanceSim, which was introduced by mini-lectures and complemented by class discussions and group work. The game-based training was conducted and evaluated in two African countries (Ethiopia and Zambia) using a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative outcome measures included knowledge acquisition and change in self-efficacy. We completed a qualitative inductive thematic analysis of participant interviews to explore the views and experiences of participants with the games and training, and the impact of the training on professional practices and attitudes. The game-based training increased knowledge in the short-term and improved self-efficacy scores. The training increased participants' knowledge base, stimulated knowledge sharing and changed work practices. The game-based training offers scalable training opportunities that could nurture and capacitate the next generation of professionals in vector control.

Practicability was defined as the correct use of the self-test and the correct interpretation of the result. The correct use of self-test was conditioned by the presence of the control band after 15-min of migration. The correct interpretation of the tests was defined by the percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results coded by the numbers and verified by trained observers. A total of 167 participants (52.7% female; median age, 35.8 years; 82% with post-graduate level) were enrolled, including 83 and 84 for usability and test results interpretation substudies, respectively. All participants (100%; 95% CI: 95.6-100) correctly used the self-test. However, 12 (14.5%; 95% CI: 8.5-23.6) asked for verbal help. The percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results was 98.5% (95% CI: 96.5-99.4). However, misinterpretation occurred in only 2.3% of positive and 1.2% of invalid test results. Finally, all (100%) participants found that performing the COVID-19 self-test was easy; and 98.8% found the interpretation of the self-test results easy. Taken together, these pilot observations demonstrated for the first-time, high practicability and satisfaction of COVID-19 self-testing for serological IgG and IgM immune status, indicating its potential for use by the general public to complete the arsenal of available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in the urgent context of the COVID-19 epidemic.

J	Hein, NA; Bagenda, DS; Luo, JT				Hein, Nicholas A.; Bagenda, Danstan S.; Luo, Jiangtao			The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and adult mortality: A replication study of HIV development assistance effects in Sub-Saharan African countries	PLOS ONE			English	Article								The US budget for global health funding, which was by far the largest of similar funding in the world, increased from US $1.3 billion in 2001 to more than US $10 billion in recent years. More than 54% of this funding was allocated to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS through the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Africa. However, recent studies indicate contradictory results regarding the effectiveness of PEPFAR. One by Bendavid, Holmes, Bhattacharya, and Miller shows positive effects of PEPFAR in reducing adult mortality in Africa, while another by Duber, Coates, Szekeras, Kaji, and Lewis finds that there are no significant differences in reducing adult mortality in countries that received PEPFAR funding vs countries that did not. Due to their potential impact on policy decisions regarding critical global health funding, we wanted to assess why the results are discrepant. To do this, we replicated the Bendavid study. The replication provides verification that the study replicable and that the analytic choices of the authors are robust to different assumptions or restrictions. This allows us to assess the different choices and data available to the two research groups and draw some conclusions about why the results may be different. Then, focusing on two of the prominently discrepant studies, i.e., the Bendavid study (1998-2008) and the Duber study (2000-2006), we establish why the two studies are in disagreement. We apply appropriate individual-level and country-level analytical methodology as used by Bendavid over the analytical time period used for the Duber study (2000-2006), which originally focused on nationally aggregated data and differed in some key focus countries. For our first objective, we replicated the original Bendavid study findings and our findings support their conclusion that between 1998-2008 all-cause mortality decreased significantly more (OR = 0.84, CI, 0.72-0.99) in countries that implemented PEPFAR. For our second objective (Bendavid's data and methodology applied to Duber's study period), we found reduction in all cause adult mortality to be borderline insignificant (OR = 0.87 CI, 0.75-1.01, p = 0.06), most possibly reflecting the abbreviated fewer number of events and sample size over a shorter period. Therefore, our overall analyses are consistent with the conclusion of positive impact of the PEPFAR program in reducing adult mortality. We believe that the discrepancy observed in the original studies mainly a reflection of shortcomings in the analytical approach necessitated by the Duber study's nationally aggregated dataset or "may reflect a lack of data quality" in the Duber study (Duber, et al. 2010).

The objective of this trial was to assess the feasibility of supplying free e-cigarette starter kits to smokers accessing homeless centres and to estimate parameters to inform a possible future larger trial. In this feasibility cluster trial, four homeless centres in Great Britain were non-randomly allocated to either a Usual Care (UC) or E-Cigarette (EC) arm. Smokers attending the centres were recruited by staff. UC arm participants (N = 32) received advice to quit and signposting to the local Stop Smoking Service. EC arm participants (N = 48) received an EC starter kit and 4-weeks supply of e-liquid. Outcome measures were recruitment and retention rates, use of ECs, smoking cessation/reduction and completion of measures required for economic evaluation. Eighty (mean age 43 years; 65% male) of the 153 eligible participants who were invited to participate, were successfully recruited (52%) within a five-month period, and 47 (59%) of these were retained at 24 weeks. The EC intervention was well received with minimal negative effects and very few unintended consequences (e.g. lost, theft, adding illicit substances). In both study arm, depression and anxiety scores declined over the duration of the study. Substance dependence scores remained constant. Assuming those with missing follow up data were smoking, CO validated sustained abstinence at 24 weeks was 3/48 (6.25%) and 0/32 (0%) respectively for the EC and UC arms. Almost all participants present at follow-up visits completed data collection for healthcare service and health-related quality of life measures. Providing an e-cigarette starter kit to smokers experiencing homelessness was associated with reasonable recruitment and retention rates and promising evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

Enumerating regulatory T cells in cryopreserved umbilical cord blood samples using FOXP3 methylation specific quantitative PCR	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXPRESSION; PREDICTION; POTENCY; GRAFTS; TREGS	Background Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative therapy for severe haematological disorders. However, it carries significant risk of morbidity and mortality. To improve patient outcomes, better graft selection strategies are needed, incorporating HLA matching with clinically important graft characteristics. Studies have shown that the cellular content of HCT grafts, specifically higher ratios of T regulatory (Tregs)/T cells, are important factors influencing outcomes when using adult peripheral blood mobilised grafts. So far, no equivalent study exists in umbilical cord blood (CB) transplantation due to the limitations of cryopreserved CB samples. Study design and methods To establish the most robust and efficient way to measure the Treg content of previously cryopreserved CB units, we compared the enumeration of Treg and CD3+ cells using flow cytometry and an epigenetic, DNA-based methodology. The two methods were assessed for their agreement, consistency and susceptibility to error when enumerating Treg and CD3+ cell numbers in both fresh and cryopreserved CB samples. Results Epigenetic enumeration gave consistent and comparable results in both fresh and frozen CB samples. By contrast, assessment of Tregs and CD3+ cells by flow cytometry was only possible in fresh samples due to significant cell death following cryopreservation and thawing. Conclusion Epigenetic assessment offers significant advantages over flow cytometry for analysing cryopreserved CB; similar cell numbers were observed both in fresh and frozen samples. Furthermore, multiple epigenetic assessments can be performed from DNA extracted from small cryopreserved CB segments; often the only CB sample available for clinical studies.

J	Wei, JY; Wang, L; Yang, X				Wei, Jinyu; Wang, Li; Yang, Xin			Game analysis on the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic under the prevention and control measures of the government	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CORONAVIRUS; PNEUMONIA; RISK	In this paper, the interaction strategies and the evolutionary game analysis of the actions taken by the government and the public in the early days of the epidemic are incorporated into the natural transmission mechanism model of the epidemic, and then the transmission frequency equations of COVID-19 epidemic is established. According to the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK and China, the upper limit of the spread of COVID-19 in different evolutionary scenarios is set. Using SPSS to perform logistic curve fitting, the frequency fitting equations of cumulative confirmed cases under different evolution scenarios are obtained respectively. The analysis result shows that the emergency response strategy adopted by the government in the early days of the epidemic can effectively control the spread of the epidemic. Combined with the transmission frequency equation of COVID-19 epidemic, measures taken by the government are analyzed. The influence of each measure on the frequency variable is judged and then the influence on the spread of the epidemic is obtained. Finally, based on the above analysis, the government is advised to adhere to the principles of scientific, initiative and flexibility when facing major epidemics.

J	Ahinkorah, BO				Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku			Individual and contextual factors associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies among adolescent girls and young women in selected high fertility countries in sub-Saharan Africa: A multilevel mixed effects analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNPLANNED PREGNANCY; HEALTH SURVEYS; TRANSITION; CHILDBEARING	Introduction Unintended pregnancies are associated with a number of risk factors such as malnutrition, mental illness, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality and horizontal transmission of HIV to children. These risks are predominant among adolescent girls and young women compared to older women. This study examined the individual and contextual factors associated with unintended pregnancy among adolescent girls and young women in selected high fertility countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods Data for this study was obtained from recent Demographic and Health Surveys carried out between 2010 and 2018 in 10 countries in sub-Sahara Africa. The sample size for this study was made up of 6,791 adolescent girls and young women (aged 15-24), who were pregnant during the surveys and had complete responses on all the variables considered in the study. Unintended pregnancy was the outcome variable in this study. Descriptive and multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed and the fixed effect results of the multilevel logistic regression analysis were reported as adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence interval. Results Unintended pregnancy in the selected countries was 22.4%, with Angola, recording the highest prevalence of 46.6% while Gambia had the lowest prevalence of 10.2%. The likelihood of unintended pregnancy was high among adolescent girls and young women aged 15-19 [aOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.26-1.73], those with primary [aOR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.69-2.33] and secondary/higher [aOR = 2.30; 95% CI = 1.90-2.78] levels of education, single (never married/separated/divorced/widowed) adolescent girls and young women [aOR = 9.23; 95% CI = 7.55-11.28] and those who were cohabiting [aOR = 2.53; 95% CI = 2.16-2.96]. The odds of unintended pregnancy also increased with increasing birth order, with adolescent girls and young women having three or more births more likely to have unintended pregnancies compared to those with one birth [aOR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.59-2.48]. Adolescent girls and young women who had ever used contraceptives (modern or traditional), had higher odds of unintended pregnancies compared to those who had never used contraceptives [aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.12-1.54]. Finally, adolescent girls and young women who belonged to the rich wealth quintile were more likely to have unintended pregnancy compared to those in the poor wealth quintile [1.28; 95% CI = 1.08-1.51]. Conclusion The study found that age, marital status, level of education, parity, use of contraceptives and wealth quintile are associated with unintended pregnancy among adolescent girls and young women in high fertility sub-Saharan African countries. These findings call for the need for government and non-governmental organisations in high fertility sub-Saharan African countries to restructure sexual and reproductive health services, taking into consideration these individual and contextual level characteristics of adolescent girls and young women.

The Society for Family Health (a Non-Governmental Organization) in collaboration with Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency implemented the Village Health Worker (VHW) Program in Gombe to address the low uptakes of maternal neonatal and child health (MNCH) services and reduced the impact of healthcare worker insufficiency. VHWs are lay indigenous women trained to educate and encourage women to use MNCH services, provide simple community-based maternal and new-born care through home visits, and facilitate facility linkage. We assessed the acceptability of VHW services among women beneficiaries of the Program. Methods Qualitative data were obtained through six focus group discussions with 58 women beneficiaries of the VHW program who delivered within the last 12 months preceding study period (October-November 2018). Themes explored were roles and acceptability of VHWs, and the influence of VHWs on the uptake of MNCH services. We analyzed data with NVivo 12, using Grounded Theory. Results Participants' mean age was 25.1 (+/- 5.3) years old. Most participants 39 (67%), had been in contact with a VHW for at least 10 months. VHWs visited pregnant women at home and registered them for antenatal care, provided them basic maternal healthcare, health education, and facilitated facility linkage. Participants generally accepted the VHW Program because it was community-based, VHWs were indigenous community members, delivered clear messages, and influenced husbands and mothers-in-law to support women's' use of MNCH services. VHWs' interventions were perceived to have improved health literacy and the uptake of MNCH services. Participants generally admired the VHW occupation and recommended VHW program scale-up, and for VHWs to be offered basic obstetric training and employment by health facilities or the government. Conclusion The general acceptance and positive views of VHWs from beneficiaries of the program demonstrates the feasibility of the program to improve the uptake of MNCH services.

However, this technique has several concerns: inadequate stability to resist rotational and shearing forces, a fibula is suboptimal for bone grafting, and an onlay fibular graft that might prevent impacting and cause distraction. We present a modified transfibular technique using partial fibular resection and onlay bone graft, which may address these potential problems. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ankle joint is well fused with neutral alignment and functionally improved at the final follow-up. For this study, 27 consecutive patients (mean age, 68.5 years; range, 58-83) who underwent tibiotalar fusion with a follow-up period of >1 year were retrospectively included. A modified transfibular lateral approach was performed, in which the distal anterior half fibula was resected and fixed as an onlay graft to achieve fusion between the tibia, fibula, talus, and fibular onlay graft simultaneously. Radiographic outcomes were assessed using computed tomography at 4 months after operation and serial follow-up radiographs. Functional outcomes were assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot scale and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score. The mean follow-up period was 17.3 (range, 12-32) months. Four months after operation, complete union was achieved in 13 patients, near-complete union in 8 patients, and partial union in the remaining 6 patients. At the final follow-up, all the patients achieved complete union and maintained neutral ankle alignment. The functional outcome showed a significant increase between the preoperative and postoperative periods. One minor complication occurred, in which medial side ankle pain was relieved after screw removal. This modified technique is safe and effective, and has several merits, including saving the soft tissue of the anterior ankle, saving the course of the peroneal tendons by leaving the posterior half of the fibula, resected fibula serving as a good bone stock, and reducing the likelihood of valgus deformity after fibulectomy.

However, the best time to introduce IPE into the undergraduate curriculum is still under debate. Methods We used a mixed-methods design based on a sequential explanatory model. Medical students from all six years at the University of Bern, Switzerland (n = 683) completed an online survey about attitudes towards interprofessional learning using a scale validated for German speakers (G-IPAS). Thirty-one medical students participated in nine semi-structured interviews focusing on their experience in interprofessional learning and on the possible impact it might have on their professional development. Results Women showed better attitudes in the G-IPAS across all years (p= 0,007). Pre-clinical students showed more positive attitudes towards IPE [Year 1 to Year 3 (p= 0.011)]. Students correctly defined IPE and its core dimensions. They appealed for more organized IPE interventions throughout the curriculum. Students also acknowledged the relevance of IPE for their future professional performance. Conclusions These findings support an early introduction of IPE into the medical curriculum. Although students realise that interprofessional learning is fundamental to high-quality patient care, there are still obstacles and stereotypes to overcome.

J	Ma, ZL; Luo, MJ; Chien, SIJ; Hu, DW; Zhao, X				Ma, Zhuanglin; Luo, Mingjie; Chien, Steven I-Jy; Hu, Dawei; Zhao, Xue			Analyzing drivers' perceived service quality of variable message signs (VMS)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOGIT MODEL; SATISFACTION; INFORMATION; TRANSIT	Recent advance in VMS technology has made it viable to ease traffic congestion and improve road traffic efficiency. However, the drivers' low compliance with the posted information may limit its performance to ease traffic congestion and improve traffic safety. This paper explores drivers' attitude to the service quality of VMS system resulted from the identified predominant influencing factors. A questionnaire is developed and used for surveying 9,600 drivers in Beijing, China. The collected data are analyzed with a multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) model considering different driver categories (e.g., private car driver, office car driver, taxi driver). The results show that the causal relationships between latent variables and socio-demographic characteristic is significant. Driving frequency, attitude towards contents of VMS, drivers' decision-making and the effectiveness of VMS message can directly and indirectly affect driver's perceived quality of service. The attitude towards formats of VMS indirectly affect their QoS resulting from the effectiveness of VMS message, while there is no indirect impact for taxi drivers. Besides, the drivers' decision-making directly affects the perceived quality of service for private car drivers and office car drivers, but there is no impact for taxi drivers. The findings of this study can provide guidance and reference for urban authorities to perform the relevant actions required to meet user expectations.

Stabilometry is a postural control assessment that has been widely used for clinical populations. However, the scant systematic knowledge about the reliability of stabilometric protocols for adults with ID renders results questionable and limits its value for clinicians and researchers. The study's purpose was to develop a stabilometric protocol for adults with and without ID based on optimal combinations of shortest necessary trial durations and the least number of trial repetitions that guarantee sufficient reliability. Participants performed six trials of bipedal standing in 2 vision (eyes open vs eyes closed) x 2 surface (solid vs compliant) conditions on a force platform. Several parameters were calculated from the first 10-, 20-, and 30-s interval of every center-of-pressure (COP) trial data. For different trial durations, we identified the number of trials that yielded acceptable relative (intraclass correlation coefficient >= 0.70) and absolute (standard error of measurement < 20%) reliability using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula. To determine the optimal combination of trial duration and number of repetition for each COP parameter, we implemented a two-step process: 1) identify the largest number of repetition for each of the three trial durations and then 2) select the trial duration with the lowest number of repetition. For both ID- and non-ID groups, we observed a trend whereby shorter trial durations required more repetitions and vice versa. The phase plane and ellipse area were the most and least reliable center-of-pressure parameter, respectively. To achieve acceptable reliability, four 30-s trials of each experimental condition appeared to be optimal for testing participants with and without ID alike. The results of this research can inform stabilometric test protocols of future postural control studies of adults with ID.

Evaluating the prevalence and risk factors for macrolide resistance inMycoplasma genitaliumusing a newly developed qPCR assay	PLOS ONE			English	Article							REAL-TIME PCR; MYCOPLASMA-GENITALIUM; TRICHOMONAS-VAGINALIS; CLINICAL SPECIMENS; DISEASE; URETHRITIS; INFECTION	Mycoplasma genitalium(MG) is a sexually transmitted bacterium in which macrolide resistance is rapidly increasing, limiting treatment options. We validated a new assay to detect the presence of macrolide resistance-associated mutations in MG (MG-MRAM). In 2018, symptomatic and asymptomatic clients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics in Amsterdam or The Hague were tested for MG using transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assays. The sensitivity to detect MG of the newly developed MG-MRAM qPCR was compared to the MgPa qPCR, both in relation to the TMA assay. For the sensitivity and specificity to detect relevant mutations the MG-MRAM qPCR was compared to 23SrRNA sequencing analysis. The qPCR was subsequently used to determine the presence of MG-MRAM at different anatomical locations and to identify risk factors for MG-MRAM. MG-positive clients (402) providing 493 MG-positive samples were included. In total 309/493 (62.7%) samples from 291 (72.4%) clients were successfully typed with the MG-MRAM qPCR. The MG-MRAM qPCR had a sensitivity of 98.6% (95%CI 91.1%-99.9%) and specificity of 94.1% (95%CI 78.9%-99.0%) to detect MG-MRAM compared to sequencing analysis. Infection with MG-MRAM was detected in 193/291 (66.3%) clients: in 129/178 (72.5%) men and 64/113 (56.6%) women (p = 0.005). Prevalence of MG-MRAM was significantly higher in men, clients with a higher education, HIV-positive clients and clients with >10 sexual partners in the previous six months, but in multivariable analysis no factor was significantly associated with MG-MRAM presence. Since MG-MRAM prevalence was very high, testing for MG-MRAM is essential if treatment for MG is considered, and can be performed with this sensitive and specific qPCR test in routine diagnostics.

However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases, and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modelling approach is close to the Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, active cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data.

Adult TAC Working Grp	The epidemiology and estimated etiology of pathogens detected from the upper respiratory tract of adults with severe acute respiratory infections in multiple countries, 2014-2015	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA; STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INFLUENZA; HOSPITALIZATION; PREVALENCE; VIRUSES; DISEASE; US	Introduction Etiology studies of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in adults are limited. We studied potential etiologies of SARI among adults in six countries using multi-pathogen diagnostics. Methods We enrolled both adults with SARI (acute respiratory illness onset with fever and cough requiring hospitalization) and asymptomatic adults (adults hospitalized with non-infectious illnesses, non-household members accompanying SARI patients, adults enrolled from outpatient departments, and community members) in each country. Demographics, clinical data, and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected from both SARI patients and asymptomatic adults. Specimens were tested for presence of 29 pathogens utilizing the Taqman (R) Array Card platform. We applied a non-parametric Bayesian regression extension of a partially latent class model approach to estimate proportions of SARI caused by specific pathogens. Results We enrolled 2,388 SARI patients and 1,135 asymptomatic adults from October 2013 through October 2015. We detected >= 1 pathogen in 76% of SARI patients and 67% of asymptomatic adults.Haemophilus influenzaeandStreptococcus pneumoniaewere most commonly detected (>= 23% of SARI patients and asymptomatic adults). Through modeling, etiology was attributed to a pathogen in most SARI patients (range among countries: 57.3-93.2%); pathogens commonly attributed to SARI etiology included influenza A (14.4-54.4%), influenza B (1.9-19.1%), rhino/enterovirus (1.8-42.6%), and RSV (3.6-14.6%). Conclusions Use of multi-pathogen diagnostics and modeling enabled attribution of etiology in most adult SARI patients, despite frequent detection of multiple pathogens in the upper respiratory tract. Seasonal flu vaccination and development of RSV vaccine would likely reduce the burden of SARI in these populations.

Small-molecule splicing modulators have recently attracted considerable attention as a novel class of cancer therapeutics. CDC-like kinases (CLKs) are central to exon recognition in mRNA splicing and CLK inhibitors exhibit anti-tumour activities. Most importantly, molecular mechanism-based combination strategies for cancer therapy must be considered. However, it remains unclear whether CLK inhibitors modulate expression and splicing of apoptosis-related genes, and whether CLK inhibitors enhance cytotoxicity in combination with apoptosis inducers. Here we report an appropriate mechanism-based drug combination approach. Unexpectedly, we found that the CLK inhibitor T3 rapidly induced apoptosis in A2780 cells and G2/M cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells. Regardless of the different phenotypes of the two cancer cell types, T3 decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, cFLIP and Mcl-1) for a short period of exposure and altered the splicing of the anti-apoptotic MCL1L and CFLAR isoform in A2780 and HCT116 cells. In contrast, other members of the Bcl-2 family (i.e., Bcl-xL and Bcl-2) were resistant to T3-induced expression and splicing modulation. T3 and a Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitor synergistically induced apoptosis. Taken together, the use of a CLK inhibitor is a novel therapeutic approach to sensitise cancer cells to Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitors.

In 2011, Brazil adopted its first P4P scheme at national level, the National Programme for Improving Primary Care Access and Quality (PMAQ). The contribution of PMAQ in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related to maternal and childcare remains under investigated in Brazil. Objective To estimate the association of PMAQ with the provision of maternal and childcare in Brazil, controlling for socioeconomic, geographic and family health team characteristics. Method We used cross-sectional quantile regression (QR) models for two periods, corresponding to 33,368 Family Health Teams (FHTs) in the first cycle and 39,211 FHTs in the second cycle of PMAQ. FHTs were analysed using data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (SIAB and CNES) and the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Results The average number of antenatal consultations per month were positively associated with PMAQ participating teams, with larger effect in the lower tail (10th and 25th quantiles) of the conditional distribution of the response variable. There was a positive association between PMAQ and the average number of consultations under 2 years old per month in the 10th and 25th quantiles, but a negative association in the upper tail (75th and 90th quantiles). For the average number of physician consultations for children under 1 year old per month, PMAQ participating teams were positively associated with the response variable in the lower tail, but different from the previous models, there is no clear evidence that the second cycle gives larger coefficients compared with first cycle. Conclusion PMAQ has contributed to increase the provision of care to pregnant women and children under 2 years at primary healthcare level. Teams with lower average number of antenatal or child consultations benefited the most by participating in PMAQ, which suggests that PMAQ might motivate worse performing health providers to catch up.

Following systemic administration high levels of vector particles accumulate within the liver. Kupffer cells (KCs) are liver resident macrophages and an important part of the liver innate immune system. Decreased functional activity of KCs can contribute to exaggerated inflammatory response upon antigen exposure. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) deficiency is associated with considerably reduced numbers of KCs. In this study we aimed to investigate the inflammatory responses in liver and to characterise two populations of hepatic macrophages in adult wild type (WT) and HO-1 knockout (KO) mice following systemic administration of one or two doses (separated by 3 months) of self-complementary (sc)AAV9 vectors. At steady state, the livers of HO-1 KO mice contained significantly higher numbers of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), but significantly less KCs than their WT littermates. Three days after re-administration of scAAV9 we observed increased mRNA level of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) in the livers of both WT and HO-1 KO mice, but the protein level and the macrophage infiltration were not affected. Three days after the 1(st)and 3 days after the 2(nd)vector dose the numbers of AAV genomes in the liver were comparable between both genotypes indicating similar transduction efficiency, but the percentage of transgene-expressing MDMs and KCs was higher in WT than in HO-1 KO mice. In the primary culture, KCs were able to internalize AAV9 particles without induction of TLR9-mediated immune responses, but no transgene expression was observed. In conclusion,in vivoandin vitrocultured KCs have different susceptibility to scAAV9 vectors.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidea) is the most destructive cosmopolitan insect pest of the Platypodinae. Pheromone-based luring agents are used currently in controlling bark beetle. Antennae are the primary insect organs sensing volatiles of host trees and pheromones of pioneer males. We studied the external morphology of antennae and the type, distribution, and the number of the beetle sensilla. Our results show E. parallelus have a geniculate antenna composed of 6 segments, namely the scape, 4-segmented funicle and club. Ninety-seven percent of the antennal sensors were distributed in the club, and 3% were distributed in the scape and funicle. 6 types of sensilla on the antennae were found, including sensilla trichodea (subtypes: STI, STII and STIII), sensilla basiconica (subtypes: SBI, SBII, SBIII and SBIV), sensilla chaetica (subtypes: SChI, SChII and SChIII), as well as sensilla coeloconica, sensilla campaniform and sensilla furcatea. There was no significant difference in the type, distribution and number of sensilla in males and females. No significant difference in the shape and distribution of antennae was found between sexes, but the length of antennae and the number of SChI, SChII, STI, SBI, SBIII and SBIV were significantly larger in females than males. We revealed the external cuticular structure of the antennae in E. parallelus, which can be used to guide future electrophysiological investigations to understand the ability of this beetle to detect semiochemicals.

We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantify (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people (similar to 87%) can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents (similar to 13%) live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas visit parks that are potentially overcrowded during periods of high use. Such disparity in urban areas of England and Wales becomes particularly evident during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown when local parks, the only available out-of-home space option, hinder social distancing requirements. Cities aiming to facilitate social distancing while keeping public green spaces safe might require implementing measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-based stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as an alternative option to postpone starting ADT and its associated side effects including the development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to determine progression free-survival (PFS) and treatment failure free-survival (TFFS) after PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT in OMPC patients. The efficacy and safety of single fraction radiosurgery (SFRS) and ADT delay were investigated. Methods Patients with <= 5 metastases from OMPC, with/without ADT treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT were retrospectively analyzed. PFS and TFFS were primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and ADT-free survival (ADTFS). Results Fifty patients with a total of 75 metastases detected by PSMA-PET/CT were analyzed. At the time of SBRT, 70% of patients were castration-sensitive. Overall, 80% of metastases were treated with SFRS (median dose 20 Gy, range: 16-25). After median follow-up of 34 months (range: 5-70) median PFS and TFFS were 12 months (range: 2-63) and 14 months (range: 2-70), respectively. Thirty-two (64%) patients had repeat oligometastatic disease. Twenty-four (48%) patients with progression underwent second SBRT course. Two-year LC after SFRS was 96%. Grade 1 and 2 toxicity occurred in 3 (6%) and 1 (2%) patients, respectively. ADTFS and OS rates at 2-years were 60.5% and 100%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, TFFS significantly improved in patients with time to first metastasis (TTM) >36 months (p = 0.01) and PSA before SBRT <= 1 ng/ml (p = 0.03). Conclusion For patients with OMPC, SBRT might be used as an alternative to ADT. This way, the start/escalation of palliative ADT and its side effects can be deferred. Metastases treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SFRS reached excellent LC with minimal toxicity. Low PSA levels and longer TTM predict elongated TFFS.

J	Xu, YS; Moller, J; Wang, R; Liang, YJ				Xu, Yongshi; Moller, Jette; Wang, Rui; Liang, Yajun			Life-course blood pressure trajectories and cardiovascular diseases: A population-based cohort study in China	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK; HYPERTENSION; ASSOCIATION; ADULTHOOD; CHILDHOOD; GROWTH; STROKE; IMPACT	Background The patterns of blood pressure trajectory (i.e., change over time) over life-course remain to be explored. In this study, we aim to determine the trajectories of systolic blood pressure (SBP) from adulthood to late life and to assess its impact on the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Methods Based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a total of 3566 participants aged 20-50 years at baseline (1989) with at least three SBP measurements during 1989-2011 were included. SBP was measured through physical examination, and socio-demographic factors, lifestyles, medications, and CVDs were based on self-reported questionnaire. Latent class growth modeling was performed to examine SBP trajectory. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from logistic regression was used to determine the association between SBP trajectory and CVDs. Results Five trajectory groups of SBP were identified: Class 1: rapid increase (n = 113, 3.2%); Class 2: slight increase (n = 1958, 54.9%); Class 3: stable (n = 614, 17.2%); Class 4: increase (n = 800, 22.4%); Class 5: fluctuant (n = 81, 2.3%). After adjustment of demographic factors, baseline SBP, and lifestyles, compared with the "slight increase" group, the OR (95% CI) of CVDs was 0.65 (0.32, 1.28) for "stable" group, 2.24 (1.40, 3.58) for "increase" group, 3.95 (1.81, 8.62) for "rapid increase" group, and 4.32 (1.76, 10.57) for "fluctuant" group. After stratified by use of antihypertensive drugs, the association was only significant for "rapid increase" group among those using antihypertensive drugs with OR (95% CI) of 2.81 (1.01, 7.77). Conclusions Having a rapidly increasing SBP over life-course is associated with a higher risk of CVDs. This implies the importance of monitoring lifetime change of blood pressure for the prevention of CVDs.

To clarify the factors underlying the discomfort status and predictive factors for strong cough during bronchoscopy, we prospectively evaluated patients who underwent bronchoscopy at Kyorin University Hospital between March 2018 and July 2019. Before and after bronchoscopy, the enrolled patients answered a questionnaire regarding the procedure. At the same time, bronchoscopists evaluated cough severity using a four-grade cough scale. We evaluated patient characteristics and predictive factors associated with bronchoscopy from the perspective of discomfort and strong cough. A total of 172 patients were ultimately enrolled in this study. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, comparison of the subjective data between the discomfort and comfort groups revealed that factors that were more common in the former group were younger age (OR = 0.96,p= 0.002), less experienced bronchoscopist (OR = 2.08,p= 0.047), and elevation of cough score per 1 point (OR = 1.69,p< 0.001). Furthermore, the predictive factors for strong cough prior to performing bronchoscopy were female sex (OR = 2.57,p= 0.009), EBUS-TBNA (OR = 2.95,p= 0.004), and prolonged examination time of more than 36 min (OR = 2.32,p= 0.022). Regarding patients' discomfort,younger age, less experienced bronchoscopist, and the elevation of cough score per 1 point were important factors for discomfort in bronchoscopy. On the other hand, female sex, EBUS-TBNA, and prolonged examination time were crucial factors for strong cough.

Pieter			Single versus dual-rate learning when exposed to Coriolis forces during reaching movements	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOTOR; ADAPTATION; DYNAMICS; MEMORY	When we reach for an object during a passive whole body rotation, a tangential Coriolis force is generated on the arm. Yet, within a few trials, the brain adapts to this force so it does not disrupt the reach. Is this adaptation governed by a single-rate or dual-rate learning process? Here, guided by state-space modeling, we studied human reach adaptation in a fully-enclosed rotating room. After 90 pre-rotation reaches (baseline), participants were trained to make 240 to-and-fro reaches while the room rotated at 10 rpm (block A), then performed 6 reaches under opposite room rotation (block B), and subsequently made 100 post-rotation reaches (washout). A control group performed the same paradigm, but without the reaches during rotation block B. Single-rate and dual-rate models can be best dissociated if there would be full un-learning of compensation A during block B, but minimal learning of B. From the perspective of a dual-rate model, the un-learning observed in block B would mainly be caused by the faster state, such that the washout reaches would show retention effects of the slower state, called spontaneous recovery. Alternatively, following a single-rate model, the same state would govern the learning in block A and un-learning in block B, such that the washout reaches mimic the baseline reaches. Our results do not provide clear signs of spontaneous recovery in the washout reaches. Model fits further show that a single-rate process outperformed a dual-rate process. We suggest that a single-rate process underlies Coriolis force reach adaptation, perhaps because these forces relate to familiar body dynamics and are assigned to an internal cause.

Compliance with standard safety precaution is effective and inexpensive measure to improve quality of healthcare in reducing occurrence of healthcare associated infections. In developing countries, like Ethiopia adherence to recommended standard safety precaution is scanty. Objective To assess level of compliance with standard safety precaution and associated factors among healthcare workers in Hawassa comprehensive specialized hospital Southern Ethiopia. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted at Hawassa comprehensive specialized hospital. Data were collected by using self-administered questionnaire. Study participants were allocated proportionally based on their profession by using stratified random sampling method. Data were entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. Bi-variable analysis and multi variable logistic regression model were used to check which variables were associated with dependent variable. P-values <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In this study the overall compliance with standard safety precaution among healthcare workers were only 56.5%. Being female healthcare worker AOR: 2.76(1.34, 5.54), married healthcare workers AOR: 4.2(2, 9.03), accessibility of safety box AOR: 3.4(1.6, 7.17), HCWs had perceived IP training AOR: 3.99(1.46, 10.9), availability of tape water AOR: 2.68(1.15, 6.2) and healthcare workers had internal infection prevention and control supportive supervision AOR: 5.8(2.54, 13.48) associated with compliance with standard safety precaution. Conclusion According to findings of the current study, overall level of compliance with standard SP among HCWs considered to be very low. Factors such as healthcare workers being female, accessibility of safety box, availability of running tape water, training and supportive supervision were independent predictors of compliance with standard safety precaution. Thus ensuring availability and accessibility of safety precaution materials and regular observing and supervising healthcare workers' practices are highly recommended.

Both HIV replication and antiretroviral therapy are recognised causes of renal impairment. Objective of the study is to describe the impact of viremia copy-years (VCY) and antiretroviral therapy on trend of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a cohort of adults with perinatal HIV infection. We conducted a multicentre observational study in sixty adults living with PHIV across a 9-year period, from January 2010 to December 2018. The mean values of eGFR were analysed at the first (T0) and last year of observation (T1). VCY was defined as the area under HIV-RNA curve during the study period. We analysed data according to antiretroviral therapy: tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), boosted protease inhibitors (PI/b), integrase inhibitors (INI). We observed a mean overall eGFR reduction from 126.6 mL/min (95%CI: 119.6-133.5) to 105.0 mL/min (95%CI: 99.55-110.6) (p<0.001). Older age, higher baseline eGFR, higher VCY and longer exposure to INI treatment were associated with eGFR reduction at univariate analysis. In the multivariate model, older age (p= 0.039), baseline eGFR (p<0.001) and VCY (p= 0.069), were retained. We also observed a longer exposure to PI/b and INI in patients with lower control on HIV-RNA, expressed as VCY>2 log(10). Our study outlines a progressive eGFR reduction in young adults with PHIV, related to the lower control on HIV-RNA VCY and related to aging.

Targeted detection and quantitation of histone modifications from 1,000 cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MODIFICATIONS PREDICT PROGNOSIS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY REVEALS; CANCER; ACETYLATION; METHYLATION; CHROMATIN; H3; QUANTIFICATION; PROTEINS; PATTERNS	Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) create a powerful regulatory mechanism for maintaining chromosomal integrity in cells. Histone acetylation and methylation, the most widely studied histone PTMs, act in concert with chromatin-associated proteins to control access to genetic information during transcription. Alterations in cellular histone PTMs have been linked to disease states and have crucial biomarker and therapeutic potential. Traditional bottom-up mass spectrometry of histones requires large numbers of cells, typically one million or more. However, for some cell subtype-specific studies, it is difficult or impossible to obtain such large numbers of cells and quantification of rare histone PTMs is often unachievable. An established targeted LC-MS/MS method was used to quantify the abundance of histone PTMs from cell lines and primary human specimens. Sample preparation was modified by omitting nuclear isolation and reducing the rounds of histone derivatization to improve detection of histone peptides down to 1,000 cells. In the current study, we developed and validated a quantitative LC-MS/MS approach tailored for a targeted histone assay of 75 histone peptides with as few as 10,000 cells. Furthermore, we were able to detect and quantify 61 histone peptides from just 1,000 primary human stem cells. Detection of 37 histone peptides was possible from 1,000 acute myeloid leukemia patient cells. We anticipate that this revised method can be used in many applications where achieving large cell numbers is challenging, including rare human cell populations.

Evaluating the quality of evidence for gaming disorder: A summary of systematic reviews of associations between gaming disorder and depression or anxiety	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ONLINE GAME ADDICTION; CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; RISK-FACTORS; INTERNET; ADOLESCENTS; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; BEHAVIOR; TRIALS	Gaming disorder has been described as an urgent public health problem and has garnered many systematic reviews of its associations with other health conditions. However, review methodology can contribute to bias in the conclusions, leading to research, policy, and patient care that are not truly evidence-based. This study followed a pre-registered protocol (PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018090651) with the objective of identifying reliable and methodologically-rigorous systematic reviews that examine the associations between gaming disorder and depression or anxiety in any population. We searched PubMed and PsycInfo for published systematic reviews and the gray literature for unpublished systematic reviews as of June 24, 2020. Reviews were classified as reliable according to several quality criteria, such as whether they conducted a risk of bias assessment of studies and whether they clearly described how outcomes from each study were selected. We assessed possible selective outcome reporting among the reviews. Seven reviews that included a total of 196 studies met inclusion criteria. The overall number of participants was not calculable because not all reviews reported these data. All reviews specified eligibility criteria for studies, but not for outcomes within studies. Only one review assessed risk of bias. Evidence of selective outcome reporting was found in all reviews-only one review incorporated any of the null findings from studies it included. Thus, none were classified as reliable according to prespecified quality criteria. Systematic reviews related to gaming disorder do not meet methodological standards. As clinical and policy decisions are heavily reliant on reliable, accurate, and unbiased evidence synthesis; researchers, clinicians, and policymakers should consider the implications of selective outcome reporting. Limitations of the current summary include using counts of associations and restricting to systematic reviews published in English. Systematic reviewers should follow established guidelines for review conduct and transparent reporting to ensure evidence about technology use disorders is reliable.

This study investigated the dimensionality of HDRS17 for patients undergoing treatment in UK mental health settings with moderate to severe persistent major depressive disorder (PMDD). Methods Exploratory Structural Equational Modelling (ESEM) was performed to examine the HDRS17 factor structure for adult PMDD patients with HDRS17 score >= 16. Participants (n = 187) were drawn from a multicentre RCT conducted in UK community mental health settings evaluating the outcomes of a depression service comprising CBT and psychopharmacology within a collaborative care model, against treatment as usual (TAU). The construct stability across a 12-month follow-up was examined through a measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) procedure via ESEM. Results ESEM showed HDRS17 had a bi-factor structure for PMDD patients (baseline mean (sd) HDRS17 22.6 (5.2); 87% PMDD >1 year) with an overall depression factor and two group factors: vegetative-worry and retardation-agitation, further complicated by negative item loading. This bi-factor structure was stable over 12 months follow up. Analysis of the HDRS6 showed it had a unidimensional structure, with positive item loading also stable over 12 months. Conclusions In this cohort of moderate-severe PMDD the HDRS17 had a bi-factor structure stable across 12 months with negative item loading on domain specific factors, indicating that it may be more appropriate to multidimensional assessment of settled clinical states, with shorter unidimensional subscales such as the HDRS6 used as measures of change.

The present mixed ecological study assesses the evidence for an association between the community-level social capital and the individual level of self-rated health. The Hakui City Health Interview Survey targeted 15,242 people aged 40 years and older from 11 communities. Among them, 6578 residents responded to the questionnaire (response rate, 43.2%). We examined whether the community-level social capital (general trust, norm, and civic participation) was associated with the individual level of self-rated health. Overall, 1919 (29.1%) answers of self-rated poor health were identified. Community-level civic participation was negatively associated with poor self-rated health after adjusting for individual demographic factors, individual social capitals, and community-level economic status, whereas community-level general trust, and norm were not significant. The findings suggest the importance of fostering communities with high civic participation to reduce the poor health status of residents.

White matter tract microstructure and cognitive performance after transient ischemic attack	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEMENTIA; STROKE; DISEASE; RISK; MRI; MEMORY	Background and purpose Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) show evidence of cognitive impairment but the reason is not clear. Measurement of microstructural changes in white matter (WM) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be a useful outcome measure. We report WM changes using DTI and the relationship with neuropsychological performance in a cohort of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and non-TIA subjects. Methods Ninety-five TIA subjects and 51 non-TIA subjects were assessed using DTI and neuropsychological batteries. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps were generated and measurements were collected from WM tracts. Adjusted mixed effects regression modelled the relationship between groups and DTI metrics. Results Transient ischemic attack subjects had a mean age of 67.9 +/- 9.4 years, and non-TIA subjects had a mean age 64.9 +/- 9.9 years. The TIA group exhibited higher MD values in the fornix (0.36 units, P < 0.001) and lower FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) (-0.29 units, P = 0.001), genu (-0.22 units, P = 0.016), and uncinate fasciculus (UF) (-0.26 units, P = 0.004). Compared to non-TIA subjects, subjects with TIA scored lower on the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment-Revised (median score 95 vs 91, P = 0.01) but showed no differences in scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (median 27 vs 26) or the Mini-Mental State Examination (median 30). TIA subjects had lower scores in memory (median 44 vs 52, P 0.01) and processing speed (median 45 vs 62, P 0.01) but not executive function, when compared to non-TIA subjects. Lower FA and higher MD in the fornix, SLF, and UF were associated with poorer performance on tests of visual memory and executive function but not verbal memory. Lower FA in the UF and fornix were related to higher timed scores on the TMT-B (P 0.01), and higher SLF MD was related to higher scores on TMT-B (P 0.01), confirming worse executive performance in the TIA group. Conclusions DTI scans may be useful for detecting microstructural disease in TIA subjects before cognitive symptoms develop. DTI parameters, white matter hyperintensities, and vascular risk factors underly some of the altered neuropsychological measures in TIA subjects.

Technical determinants of success in professional women's soccer: A wider range of variables reveals new insights	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAME-RELATED STATISTICS; PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE; FEMALE SOCCER; LOSING TEAMS; PHYSIOLOGY; PLAYERS	Knowledge of optimal technical performance is used to determine match strategy and the design of training programs. Previous studies in men's soccer have identified certain technical characteristics that are related to success. These studies however, have relative limited sample sizes or limited ranges of performance indicators, which may have limited the analytical approaches that were used. Research in women's soccer and our understanding of optimal technical performance, is even more limited (n = 3). Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify technical determinants of match outcome in the women's game and to compare analytical approaches using a large sample size (n = 1390 team performances) and range of variables (n = 450). Three different analytical approaches (i.e. combinations of technical performance variables) were used, a data-driven approach, a rational approach and an approach based on the literature in men's soccer. Match outcome was modelled using variables from each analytical approach, using generalised linear modelling and decision trees. It was found that the rational and data-driven approaches outperformed the literature-driven approach in predicting match outcome. The strongest determinants of match outcome were; scoring first, intentional assists relative to the opponent, the percentage of shots on goal saved by the goalkeeper relative to the opponent, shots on goal relative to the opponent and the percentage of duels that are successful. Moreover the rational and data-driven approach achieved higher prediction accuracies than comparable studies about men's soccer.	[de Jong, Laura M.

This study aims to assess the serologic profiles and time kinetics of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with COVID-19 using two immunoassays. Methods A total of 97 samples serially collected from 17 patients with COVID-19 and 137 negative control samples were analyzed for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using the AFIAS COVID-19 Ab (Boditech Med Inc., Chuncheon, Republic of Korea) and the EDI((TM))Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA Kit (Epitope Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA). Results With both assays, IgM and IgG rapidly increased after 7 days post symptom onset (PSO). IgM antibody levels reached a peak at 15-35 d PSO and gradually decreased. IgG levels gradually increased and remained at similar levels after 22-35 d. The diagnostic sensitivities of IgM/IgG for <= 14d PSO were 21.4%/35.7 similar to 57.1% and increased to 41.2 similar to 52.9%/88.2 similar to 94.1% at >14 d PSO with specificities of 98.5%/94.2% for AFIAS COVID-19 Ab and 100.0%/96.4% for EDI((TM))Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA Kit. Among 137 negative controls, 12 samples (8.8%) showed positive or indeterminate results. Conclusions The antibody kinetics against SARS-CoV-2 are similar to common findings of acute viral infectious diseases.

Predisaster predictors of posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories: An analysis of low-income women in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; MENTAL-HEALTH; LATENT CLASS; SCREENING SCALES; RESILIENCE; DISASTER; SURVIVORS; IMPACT; DEPRESSION	Exposure to disasters is associated with a range of posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories. However, few studies have tracked PTSS for more than a decade postdisaster, and none to our knowledge has explored the role of predisaster resources and vulnerabilities in shaping the likelihood of trajectory membership. The current study included participants from the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina Study (N=885). Participants were originally part of a community college intervention study and were assessed prior to the hurricane (6-21 months predisaster), and approximately 1 year, 4 years, and 12 years postdisaster. Latent class growth analysis identified PTSS trajectories. Perceived social support, probable mental illness, and physical health conditions or problems-all assessed predisaster-were examined as predictors of trajectory membership at the univariate level and in multivariable models without and with adjustment for disaster exposure. Three PTSS trajectories were detected:Moderate-Decreasing(69.3%),High-Decreasing(23.1%), andHigh-Stable(7.6%). In the multivariable predictive model without adjustment for disaster exposure, probable predisaster mental illness was significantly associated with greater odds of theHigh-DecreasingandHigh-Stabletrajectories, and physical health conditions or problems with greater odds of theHigh-Decreasingtrajectory, relative to theModerate-Decreasingtrajectory. However, when disaster exposure was adjusted, only the association between predisaster mental illness and the odds of theHigh-Stable trajectory remained statistically significant. Lower predisaster perceived social support was significantly associated with membership in theHigh-Decreasingtrajectory, relative to theModerate-Decreasing, at the univariate level, but not in either multivariable model. Whereas predisaster mental illness confers risk for chronic postdisaster PTSS, other impacts of predisaster resources and vulnerabilities on elevated PTSS trajectories do not go beyond those of disaster exposure. The results support disaster preparedness efforts targeting those with mental and physical health conditions, and postdisaster mental health services addressing preexisting vulnerabilities in addition to disaster-related PTSS.

J	Heer, H; Streib, L; Schafer, RB; Ruzika, S				Heer, Henriette; Streib, Lucas; Schaefer, Ralf B.; Ruzika, Stefan			Maximising the clustering coefficient of networks and the effects on habitat network robustness	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; COMPLEX NETWORKS; BIODIVERSITY SCENARIOS; CONSERVATION; VULNERABILITY; GRAPHS	The robustness of networks against node failure and the response of networks to node removal has been studied extensively for networks such as transportation networks, power grids, and food webs. In many cases, a network's clustering coefficient was identified as a good indicator for network robustness. In ecology, habitat networks constitute a powerful tool to represent metapopulations or -communities, where nodes represent habitat patches and links indicate how these are connected. Current climate and land-use changes result in decline of habitat area and its connectivity and are thus the main drivers for the ongoing biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts are therefore needed to improve the connectivity and mitigate effects of habitat loss. Habitat loss can easily be modelled with the help of habitat networks and the question arises how to modify networks to obtain higher robustness. Here, we develop tools to identify which links should be added to a network to increase the robustness. We introduce two different heuristics, Greedy and Lazy Greedy, to maximize the clustering coefficient if multiple links can be added. We test these approaches and compare the results to the optimal solution for different generic networks including a variety of standard networks as well as spatially explicit landscape based habitat networks. In a last step, we simulate the robustness of habitat networks before and after adding multiple links and investigate the increase in robustness depending on both the number of added links and the heuristic used. We found that using our heuristics to add links to sparse networks such as habitat networks has a greater impact on the clustering coefficient compared to randomly adding links. The Greedy algorithm delivered optimal results in almost all cases when adding two links to the network.

Randomized nutrient bar supplementation improves exercise-associated changes in plasma metabolome in adolescents and adult family members at cardiometabolic risk	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH; NATIONAL-HEALTH; HEART-DISEASE; WEIGHT-LOSS; OBESITY; CERAMIDE; OXIDATION; SYNTHASE; REVEALS; QUALITY	Background Poor diets contribute to metabolic complications of obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Metabolomic biomarkers may serve as early nutrition-sensitive health indicators. This family-based lifestyle change program compared metabolic outcomes in an intervention group (INT) that consumed 2 nutrient bars daily for 2-months and a control group (CONT). Methods Overweight, predominantly minority and female adolescent (Teen)/parent adult caretaker (PAC) family units were recruited from a pediatric obesity clinic. CONT (8 Teen, 8 PAC) and INT (10 Teen, 10 PAC) groups randomized to nutrient bar supplementation attended weekly classes that included group nutrition counseling and supervised exercise. Pre-post physical and behavioral parameters, fasting traditional biomarkers, plasma sphingolipids and amino acid metabolites were measured. Results In the full cohort, a baseline sphingolipid ceramide principal component composite score correlated with adiponectin, triglycerides, triglyceride-rich very low density lipoproteins, and atherogenic small low density lipoprotein (LDL) sublasses. Inverse associations were seen between a sphingomyelin composite score and C-reactive protein, a dihydroceramide composite score and diastolic blood pressure, and the final principal component that included glutathionone with fasting insulin and the homeostatic model of insulin resistance. In CONT, plasma ceramides, sphinganine, sphingosine and amino acid metabolites increased, presumably due to increased physical activity. Nutrient bar supplementation (INT) blunted this rise and significantly decreased ureagenic, aromatic and gluconeogenic amino acid metabolites. Metabolomic changes were positively correlated with improvements in clinical biomarkers of dyslipidemia. Conclusion Nutrient bar supplementation with increased physical activity in obese Teens and PAC elicits favorable metabolomic changes that correlate with improved dyslipidemia. The trial from which the analyses reported upon herein was part of a series of nutrient bar clinical trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02239198.

Infantile eczema is a well-established risk factor for the onset of food allergy via transdermal sensitization; however, various types of infantile eczema have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the association between CMA and EA and the sites and the severity of infantile eczema. Methods This retrospective study was based on data from patients aged 2-19 years with atopic disease who were treated between July 2015 and March 2019 in a pediatric allergy clinic in Japan. Data regarding the history of IgE-mediated symptoms, eczema in the first year of life, parental history of atopic diseases, and infantile nutrition were collected. Results A total of 289 patients were included in the study, of which 81 and 111 children had IgE-mediated CMA and EA, respectively. The rates of CMA and EA were higher in the children with infantile eczema than in those without (30% vs. 9% and 42% vs. 21%). The rate of CMA was also higher in children with eczema on the face. Significant differences were noted in the rate of CMA among children with facial eczema of exudation (adjusted odds ratio 2.398; P = 0.017) and papules (adjusted odds ratio 2.787; P = 0.008), using multivariate analysis. Conclusion The rate of IgE-mediated CMA was high among children with atopic disease having severe facial eczema during infancy.

Cortisol plays a significant role in pathophysiology of MDD. Depression can alter serum cortisol level. However, the change in serum cortisol level and its association with depressive symptom severity and improvement among patients with MDD is not well studied. Objective To outline change in serum cortisol levels and its association with severity and improvement of depressive symptoms in newly diagnosed patients with MDD. Method Hospital based longitudinal study was conducted among 34 newly diagnosed patients who met DSM-V criteria of MDD. Venous blood sample was performed twice; pre- and post- 8 weeks of treatment. Serum cortisol concentration was measured using an extracted radioimmunoassay. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) was used to rate depression at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. Paired t-test was done to look the mean difference of serum cortisol level and HAM-D, before and after treatment. Pearson correlation was done to look the association between serum cortisol levels, HAM-D scores and, sociodemographic and clinical factors. Statistical significance was set at pResults There is no significant difference in cortisol concentrations at baseline and end line (t (33) = 2.02, p = 0.052). However, there is significant difference in HAM-D total score (t (33) = 5.67, p<0.001). Baseline and end line serum cortisol levels were significantly correlated (r = .561, p = .001). Monthly family income is correlated with baseline HAM-D total score (r = -0.373, p = .030). There is no significant relationship between baseline serum cortisol level and HAM-D score. There is also no significant relationship between end line serum cortisol level and HAM-D score. Conclusions The symptoms of MDD were reduced following treatment but there is no significant difference in serum cortisol levels. Baseline and end line serum cortisol levels were significantly correlated. We recommend further research based on large sample.

Materials and methods From Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 33152 patients with stage I/II colon cancer undergoing surgery between 2004 and 2011. The cumulative incidence of CCSM and NCSM was calculated, and competing risk analysis was performed to investigate prognostic factors for cause-specific mortality. Results In patients <50, 50-75, and >75 years of age, 5-year cumulative incidence of CCSM was 5.7%, 7.8%, and 16.1%, respectively (overall, 10.6%); 5-year cumulative incidence of NCSM was 2.2%, 7.1%, and 26.9%, respectively (overall, 13.8%). The probability of CCSM and NCSM increased with advanced age. The 5-year cumulative incidence of CCSM was higher than NCSM in patients <50 years of age, whereas lower in patients >75 years of age. The probability of CCSM and NCSM was similar in patients 50-75 years of age. Competing-risk multivariable analysis demonstrated that increasing age was a strong predictor of CCSM (per year increase, SHR 1.03,95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.04). Age was most predictive of NCSM: (per year increase, SHR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.08-1.08). Conclusion Age was significantly associated with an increased cumulative incidence of CCSM and NCSM of patients with stage I/II colon cancer underwent surgery. NCSM was a significant competing event and should be adequately considered when performing survival analysis.

It should be useful enabling drivers to anticipate and detect obstacles in time to prevent accidents to other road users, especially those most vulnerable. We created a pioneering Hazard Perception and Prediction test to explore this skill in different road users (pedestrians, cyclists and drivers), with videos recorded in naturalistic scenarios: walking, riding a bicycle and driving a car. There were 79 participants (30 pedestrians, 14 cyclists, 13 novice drivers and 22 experienced drivers). Sixty videos of hazardous traffic situations were presented, divided into 2 blocks of 30 videos each: 10 walking, 10 riding a bicycle, 10 driving a car. In each situation presented, we evaluated the performance of the participants carrying out the task of predicting the hazard and estimating the risk. In the second block, after they had carried out the task, we gave them feedback on their performance and let them see the whole video (i.e., checking what happened next). The results showed that the holistic test had acceptable psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha = .846). The test was able to discriminate between the different conditions manipulated: a) between traffic hazards recorded from different perspectives: walking, riding a bicycle and driving a car; b) between participants with different user profiles: pedestrians, cyclists and drivers; c) between the two test blocks: the first evaluation only and the second combining evaluation with this complex intervention.

During bacteremia,Pseudomonas aeruginosaPAO1 adapts by altering the expression of numerous virulence genes including those involved in quorum sensing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PSEUDOMONAS QUINOLONE SIGNAL; III SECRETION SYSTEM; AERUGINOSA INFECTION; SERUM-ALBUMIN; HOMOSERINE LACTONE; CHARCOAL TREATMENT; STATIONARY-PHASE; REGULATED GENES; BOVINE SERUM; PYOCYANIN	Pseudomonas aeruginosais a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that produces numerous virulence factors and causes serious infections in trauma patients and patients with severe burns. We previously showed that the growth ofP.aeruginosain blood from severely burned or trauma patients altered the expression of numerous genes. However, the specific influence of whole blood from healthy volunteers onP.aeruginosagene expression is not known. Transcriptome analysis ofP.aeruginosagrown for 4 h in blood from healthy volunteers compared to that when grown in laboratory medium revealed that the expression of 1085 genes was significantly altered. Quorum sensing (QS), QS-related, and pyochelin synthesis genes were downregulated, while genes of the type III secretion system and those for pyoverdine synthesis were upregulated. The observed effect on the QS and QS-related genes was shown to reside within serum fraction: growth of PAO1 in the presence of 10% human serum from healthy volunteers significantly reduced the expression of QS and QS-regulated genes at 2 and 4 h of growth but significantly enhanced their expression at 8 h. Additionally, the production of QS-regulated virulence factors, including LasA and pyocyanin, was also influenced by the presence of human serum. Serum fractionation experiments revealed that part of the observed effect resides within the serum fraction containing <10-kDa proteins. Growth in serum reduced the production of many PAO1 outer membrane proteins but enhanced the production of others including OprF, a protein previously shown to play a role in the regulation of QS gene expression. These results suggest that factor(s) within human serum: 1) impactP.aeruginosapathogenesis by influencing the expression of different genes; 2) differentially regulate the expression of QS and QS-related genes in a growth phase- or time-dependent mechanism; and 3) manipulate the production ofP.aeruginosaouter membrane proteins.

(TK) is a dioecious plant in the Cucurbitaceae for which different sexes have separate medicinal uses. In order to study the genes related to sex determination, transcriptome sequencing was performed on flower buds of male and female plants using the high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 145,975 unigenes and 7110 DEGs were obtained. There were 6776 DEGs annotated to 1234 GO terms and enriched to 18 functional groups, including five biological processes related to sugar metabolism. KEGG pathway analysis indicated genes involved in hormone transduction, hormone synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. Many DEGs ofTKare involved in reproductive organ formation, hormone signal transduction and regulatory networks. Combining the results of GO, KEGG and qRT-PCR, 11 sex determining candidate genes ofTKwere selected, includingMYB80,MYB108,CER1,CBL9,ABCB19,SERK1,HSP81-3,ACS9,SEP3,AUX1andYUC6. The results provide a foundation for the study of sex differentiation inTK.

Though NAFLD may progress to end-stage liver disease, the top cause of mortality in NAFLD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most of the data on liver-related mortality in NAFLD derives from specialist liver centres. It is not clear if the higher reported mortality rates in individuals with non-cirrhotic NAFLD are entirely accounted for by complications of atherosclerosis and diabetes. Therefore, we aimed to describe the CVD burden and mortality in NAFLD when adjusting for metabolic risk factors using a 'real world' cohort. We performed a retrospective study of patients followed-up after an admission to non-specialist hospitals with a NAFLD-spectrum diagnosis. Non-cirrhotic NAFLD and NAFLD-cirrhosis patients were defined by ICD-10 codes. Cases were age-/sex-matched with non-NAFLD hospitalised patients. All-cause mortality over 14-years follow-up after discharge was compared between groups using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographics, CVD, and metabolic syndrome components. We identified 1,802 patients with NAFLD-diagnoses: 1,091 with non-cirrhotic NAFLD and 711 with NAFLD-cirrhosis, matched to 24,737 controls. There was an increasing burden of CVD with progression of NAFLD: for congestive heart failure 3.5% control, 4.2% non-cirrhotic NAFLD, 6.6% NAFLD-cirrhosis; and for atrial fibrillation 4.7% control, 5.9% non-cirrhotic NAFLD, 12.1% NAFLD-cirrhosis. Over 14-years follow-up, crude mortality rates were 14.7% control, 13.7% non-cirrhotic NAFLD, and 40.5% NAFLD-cirrhosis. However, after adjusting for demographics, non-cirrhotic NAFLD (HR 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5)) as well as NAFLD-cirrhosis (HR 3.7 (95% CI 3.0-4.5)) patients had higher mortality compared to controls. These differences remained after adjusting for CVD and metabolic syndrome components: non-cirrhotic NAFLD (HR 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.4)) and NAFLD-cirrhosis (HR 3.4 (95% CI 2.8-4.2)).

Maintaining resting cardiac fibroblasts in vitro by disrupting mechanotransduction	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; MYOFIBROBLAST; FIBROSIS; DIFFERENTIATION; ACTIVATION; INTEGRINS; ACTIN	Mechanical cues activate cardiac fibroblasts and induce differentiation into myofibroblasts, which are key steps for development of cardiac fibrosis. In vitro, the high stiffness of plastic culturing conditions will also induce these changes. It is therefore challenging to study resting cardiac fibroblasts and their activation in vitro. Here we investigate the extent to which disrupting mechanotransduction by culturing cardiac fibroblasts on soft hydrogels or in the presence of biochemical inhibitors can be used to maintain resting cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. Primary cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from adult mice and cultured on plastic or soft (4.5 kPa) polyacrylamide hydrogels. Myofibroblast marker gene expression and smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA) fibers were quantified by real-time PCR and immunostaining, respectively. Myofibroblast differentiation was prevented on soft hydrogels for 9 days, but had occurred after 15 days on hydrogels. Transferring myofibroblasts to soft hydrogels reduced expression of myofibroblast-associated genes, albeit SMA fibers remained present. Inhibitors of transforming growth factor beta receptor I (TGF beta RI) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) were effective in preventing and reversing myofibroblast gene expression. SMA fibers were also reduced by blocker treatment although cell morphology did not change. Reversed cardiac fibroblasts maintained the ability to re-differentiate after the removal of blockers, suggesting that these are functionally similar to resting cardiac fibroblasts. However, actin alpha 2 smooth muscle (Acta2), lysyl oxidase (Lox) and periostin (Postn) were no longer sensitive to substrate stiffness, suggesting that transient treatment with mechanotransduction inhibitors changes the mechanosensitivity of some fibrosis-related genes. In summary, our results bring novel insight regarding the relative importance of specific mechanical signaling pathways in regulating different myofibroblast-associated genes. Furthermore, combining blocker treatment with the use of soft hydrogels has not been tested previously and revealed that only some genes remain mechano-sensitive after phenotypic reversion. This is important information for researchers using inhibitors to maintain a "resting" cardiac fibroblast phenotype in vitro as well as for our current understanding of mechanosensitive gene regulation.

Work characteristics and health in older workers: Educational inequalities	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELF-RATED HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; JOB DEMANDS; ENVIRONMENT; POSITION; TRENDS; MODEL	To be able to extend working lives, maintaining good health in older workers is important. The aim of the present study was to identify which work characteristics are associated with physical and mental health outcomes in older workers in the Netherlands, and particularly whether there are educational differences in these associations. We used longitudinal tobit and ordered logistic regression analyses to examine the associations between physical demands, psychosocial demands, variation in tasks, autonomy, and job strain and self-rated health (SRH), functional limitations, and depressive symptoms. We included interaction terms between the work characteristics and education to examine effect modification by education. We found that high physical demands, low variation in tasks, low autonomy, and high job strain were associated with poorer physical and mental health. We found evidence for educational differences in the exposure to these work characteristics, as well as in the strengths of their associations with health, with lower educated workers being disadvantaged. The associations between physical demands (SRH: OR = 3.70 (95%CI:1.92;7.11); functional limitations: B = 1.27 (95%CI:.47;2.07)), autonomy (SRH: OR = .42(95%CI:.26;.69)), and job strain (active job; SRH: OR = .25 (95%CI:.09;.69); functional limitations: B = -1.51 (95%CI:-2.68;-.34), and health were strongest in the lower educated workers. In order to maintain good health in older workers and reduce health inequalities, it is recommended to implement workplace interventions to improve working conditions, especially among the lower educated workers.

Various algorithms have been developed for image segmentation, but clustering algorithms play an important role in the segmentation of digital images. This paper presents a novel and adaptive initialization approach to determine the number of clusters and find the initial central points of clusters for the standard K-means algorithm to solve the segmentation problem of color images. The presented scheme uses a scanning procedure of the paired Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color-channel histograms for determining the most salient modes in every histogram. Next, the histogram thresholding is applied and a search in every histogram mode is performed to accomplish RGB pairs. These RGB pairs are used as the initial cluster centers and cluster numbers that clustered each pixel into the appropriate region for generating the homogeneous regions. The proposed technique determines the best initialization parameters for the conventional K-means clustering technique. In this paper, the proposed approach was compared with various unsupervised image segmentation techniques on various image segmentation benchmarks. Furthermore, we made use of a ranking approach inspired by the Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method to account for segmentation integrity. The experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms the other existing clustering techniques by optimizing the segmentation quality and possibly reducing the classification error.

David			Effects of drought on the abundance and distribution of non-breeding shorebirds in central California, USA	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DUNLIN CALIDRIS-ALPINA; WINTERING DUNLIN; HABITAT AVAILABILITY; CARRYING-CAPACITY; EXTREME DROUGHT; PACIFIC COAST; RICE FIELDS; MANAGEMENT; MOVEMENTS; PATTERNS	Conservation of migratory species requires anticipating the potential impacts of extreme climatic events, such as extreme drought. During drought, reduced habitat availability for shorebirds creates the potential for changes in their abundance and distribution, in part because many species are highly mobile and rely on networks of interior and coastal habitats. Understanding how shorebirds responded to a recent drought cycle that peaked from 2013 to 2015 in central California, USA, will help optimize management of wetlands and fresh water for wildlife. In the Central Valley, a vast interior region that is characterized by a mosaic of wetlands and agricultural lands, we found 22% and 29% decreases in the annual abundance of shorebirds during periods of 3-year drought (2013-2015) and 2-year extreme drought (2014-2015), respectively, when compared to non-drought years. Lower abundance of shorebirds coincided with significant decreases in the mean proportion flooded of survey units (7% and 9%, respectively) that were reliant on fresh water. Drought was associated with lower abundance within both the interior Central Valley and coastal San Francisco Bay for greater and lesser yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca and T.flavipes) and long- and short-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus and L.griseus). Only dunlins (Calidris alpina) had patterns of abundance that suggested substantial shifts in distribution between the Central Valley and coastal regions of San Francisco Bay and Point Reyes. Our results indicate that drought has the potential to reduce, at least temporally, shorebird populations and flooded habitat in the Central Valley, and the ability to respond to drought by taking advantage of nearby coastal habitats may limit the long-term effects of drought on some species. Successful conservation strategies must balance the impacts of reduced habitat availability at interior sites with the ability of some migratory shorebirds to adapt rapidly to shifting distributions of resources.

Pharmacologic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MIXED AMPHETAMINE SALTS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; RELEASE OROS METHYLPHENIDATE; RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EXTENDED-RELEASE; LISDEXAMFETAMINE DIMESYLATE; ATOMOXETINE TREATMENT; DRIVING PERFORMANCE	Background Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 3% of adults globally. Many pharmacologic treatments options exist, yet the comparative benefits and harms of individual treatments are largely unknown. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to assess the relative effects of individual pharmacologic treatments for adults with ADHD. Methods We searched English-language published and grey literature sources for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving pharmacologic treatment of ADHD in adults (December 2018). The primary outcome was clinical response; secondary outcomes were quality of life, executive function, driving behaviour, withdrawals due to adverse events, treatment discontinuation, serious adverse events, hospitalization, cardiovascular adverse events, and emergency department visits. Data were pooled via pair-wise meta-analyses and Bayesian network meta-analyses. Risk of bias was assessed by use of Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed by use of the GRADE framework. Results Eighty-one unique trials that reported at least one outcome of interest were included, most of which were at high or unclear risk of at least one important source of bias. Notably, only 5 RCTs were deemed at overall low risk of bias. Included pharmacotherapies were methylphenidate, atomoxetine, dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine, guanfacine, bupropion, mixed amphetamine salts, and modafinil. As a class, ADHD pharmacotherapy improved patient- and clinician-reported clinical response compared with placebo (range: 4 to 15 RCTs per outcome); however, these findings were not conserved when the analyses were restricted to studies at low risk of bias, and the certainty of the finding is very low. There were few differences among individual medications, although atomoxetine was associated with improved patient-reported clinical response and quality of life compared with placebo. There was no significant difference in the risk of serious adverse events or treatment discontinuation between ADHD pharmacotherapies and placebo; however, the proportion of participants who withdrew due to adverse events was significantly higher among participants who received any ADHD pharmacotherapy. Few RCTs reported on the occurrence of adverse events over a long treatment duration. Conclusions Overall, despite a class effect of improving clinical response relative to placebo, there were few differences among the individual ADHD pharmacotherapies, and most studies were at risk of at least one important source of bias. Furthermore, the certainty of the evidence was very low to low for all outcomes, and there was limited reporting of long-term adverse events. As such, the choice between ADHD pharmacotherapies may depend on individual patient considerations, and future studies should assess the long-term effects of individual pharmacotherapies on patient-important outcomes, including quality of life, in robust blinded RCTs.

Using population-based data, we studied difficulty accessing non-emergency surgical care, including (1) the incidence and annual changes in incidence, (2) types of difficulties, and (3) associated factors (e.g., sociodemographics, surgery characteristics). Methods Cross-sectional data from the Canadian Community Health Survey annual components were analyzed from 2005-2014. Weighted frequencies established the annual incidence of difficulty accessing surgical care, and total incidence of types of difficulties. Chi-square analyses, independent samples t-tests, and a multivariable logistic regression examined sociodemographic and surgery-related characteristics associated with difficulty accessing surgical care. Results Among individuals who required past-year non-emergency surgery between 2005-2014 (weightedn= 3,052,072), 15.6% experienced difficulty accessing surgical care. The most common difficulty was "waited too long for surgery" (58.5%). There were significant differences in the incidence of difficulty according to year (X-2= 83.50,p< .001) from 2005-2014. The incidence of difficulty accessing surgery varied according to sex (X-2= 4.02,p< .05), surgery type (X-2= 96.09,p< .001), party responsible for cancellation/postponement (X(2)range: 4.36-19.01,p< .05), and waiting time (t= 10.59,p< .001). In particular, males, orthopedic surgery, and surgery cancelled by the surgeon or hospital had the highest rates of difficulty. Conclusion Results provide insight into the difficulties experienced by patients accessing elective surgery, and the associated factors. These results may inform targeted healthcare interventions and resource reallocation to reduce these occurrences.

Key elements of a successful integrated community-based approach aimed at reducing socioeconomic health inequalities in the Netherlands: A qualitative study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS; EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES; CHILDHOOD OBESITY; CARE; DISPARITIES	Background Since 2010, the Zwolle Healthy City approach, an integrated community-based approach, has been implemented in the Dutch municipality of Zwolle. This approach is proven successful in reducing health inequalities. However, the key elements of this approach are not clear. The current study aimed to identify key elements of this successful local community-based approach, according to the perspectives of various stakeholders. Methods Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 29 professionals who were involved in the approach in the period 2010-2018 and have occupations at the strategic (n = 4), tactical (n = 17) and operational level (n = 8). Data was analyzed using the thematic analysis approach. Results We identified nine perceived key elements that contributed to the success of the approach aimed at reducing socioeconomic health inequalities. The respondents indicated the following key elements: (1) collaboration between a variety of local organizations that want to have impact on the health of citizens; (2) support for the approach on the strategic, tactical and operational level of involved organizations; (3) proper communication and coordination, both for the network and within the organizations; (4) embeddedness in organizations' policies and processes and (5) collaboration with private organizations is of added value, although there is no "one size fits all". Other key elements are (6) collaboration with citizens, (7) profiling the approach like a brand and (8) moving along with and taking advantage of opportunities. Finally, (9) continuous monitoring and evaluating goals and processes, and learning from the results, is important. Conclusion Nine key elements were identified that, according to various stakeholders, contributed to the success of the Zwolle Healthy City approach. These insights are important to further strengthen the Zwolle Healthy City approach but may also help and inspire other local integrated community-based approaches aimed at reducing socioeconomic health inequalities, to improve and adapt the approach within their specific local and dynamic context.

Fifteen amateur golfers with an average age of 19.67 +/- 0.89 years and 4.87 +/- 1.77 points of average handicap were assigned to participate in either AFPR, PR or AF program. All participants in the three programs practiced three sessions on non-consecutive days per week during the intervention phase. Each participant's performance was assessed before and after six weeks of the program through hitting ten maximal drives with the ball flight and swing analyzed using the P3ProSwing Golf Simulator and recorded for the driver club head speed, driving distance, and driving accuracy. Multivariate analysis of variance showed no statistically significant differences (P < .05) of the performances of the golfers participated in the 3 programs (club head speed: F = 1.02, P = 0.33; accuracy: F = 0.32, P = 0.72; distance: F = 0.18, P = 0.83). Furthermore, a paired t-tests also showed no statistically significant (P < .05) improvement occurred in the 3 programs after the six-week training. Although the effect of the 3 programs did not show statistically significant increase in the performance of the amateur golfers, however, the three parameters of the performance, i.e. the driver club head speed, the driving distance and the driving accuracy showed certain improvements. The 3 training programs may have benefit to the amateur golfers with certain increases of their performance.

J	Hansen, HA; Li, J; Saygin, ZM				Hansen, Heather A.; Li, Jin; Saygin, Zeynep M.			Adults vs. neonates: Differentiation of functional connectivity between the basolateral amygdala and occipitotemporal cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; PRIMATE AMYGDALA; THALAMIC STRUCTURES; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; FEAR; MRI; PERCEPTION; INFANT; NEUROBIOLOGY	The amygdala, a subcortical structure known for social and emotional processing, consists of multiple subnuclei with unique functions and connectivity patterns. Tracer studies in adult macaques have shown that the basolateral subnuclei differentially connect to parts of visual cortex, with stronger connections to anterior regions and weaker connections to posterior regions; infant macaques show robust connectivity even with posterior visual regions. Do these developmental differences also exist in the human amygdala, and are there specific functional regions that undergo the most pronounced developmental changes in their connections with the amygdala? To address these questions, we explored the functional connectivity (from resting-state fMRI data) of the basolateral amygdala to occipitotemporal cortex in human neonates scanned within one week of life and compared the connectivity patterns to those observed in young adults. Specifically, we calculated amygdala connectivity to anterior-posterior gradients of the anatomically-defined occipitotemporal cortex, and also to putative occipitotemporal functional parcels, including primary and high-level visual and auditory cortices (V1, A1, face, scene, object, body, high-level auditory regions). Results showed a decreasing gradient of functional connectivity to the occipitotemporal cortex in adults-similar to the gradient seen in macaque tracer studies-but no such gradient was observed in neonates. Further, adults had stronger connections to high-level functional regions associated with face, body, and object processing, and weaker connections to primary sensory regions (i.e., A1, V1), whereas neonates showed the same amount of connectivity to primary and high-level sensory regions. Overall, these results show that functional connectivity between the amygdala and occipitotemporal cortex is not yet differentiated in neonates, suggesting a role of maturation and experience in shaping these connections later in life.

However, changes in the presence of this disease across years hampers the effective identification of resistant genotypes to this disease. To avoid the limitations of phenotypic selection under natural pressure, this research aimed to devise an effective strategy to screen disease-resistant genotypes in the absence of high and constant natural pressures. To do so, we investigated the presence of antixenosis and antibiosis as components of resistance to the vectorDalbulus maidisas well as resistance to the pathogenSpiroplasma kunkeliiunder artificial inoculation conditions in four maize hybrids. The hybrids shown differences in their levels of resistance and target organisms, either the insect vector or the pathogen. Antixenosis and antibiosis toD.maidiswere observed in DK72-10. Resistance toS.kunkeliiby DK79-10 was seen as a delayed onset of symptoms, and DKB390 showed antixenosis toD.maidisand resistance toS.kunkelii. An association between symptom severity and yield reduction was found, but not between accumulation of pathogenS.kunkeliiand symptom severity nor yield. In conclusion, the proposed methodology was efficacious and can aid in the screening of resistant genotypes in breeding programs to reduce the impact of Corn Stunt disease, ensuring that hybrids with good resistance level will be planted by farmers whenever disease occurs.

The country's largest city, Sao Paulo, is in a highly urbanized area with a few forest fragments which are commonly used for recreation. These can be considered to present a potential risk of flavivirus transmission to humans as they are home simultaneously to vertebrate hosts and mosquitoes that are potential flavivirus vectors. The aim of this study was to conduct flavivirus surveillance in field-collected mosquitoes in the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area (EPA) and identify the flavivirus species by sequence analysis in flavivirus IFA-positive pools. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from March 2016 to April 2017 with CO2-baited CDC light traps. Specimens were identified morphologically and grouped in pools of up to 10 individuals according to their taxonomic category. A total of 260 pools of non-engorged females were inoculated into C6/36 cell culture, and the cell suspensions were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) after the incubation period. IFA-positive pools were tested by qRT-PCR with genus-specific primers targeting the flavivirus NS5 gene to confirm IFA-positive results and sequenced to identify the species. Anopheles cruzii (19.5%) and Wyeomyia confusa (15.3%) were the most frequent vector species collected. IFA was positive for flaviviruses in 2.3% (6/260) of the sample pools. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR in five pools (83.3%). All five flavivirus-positive pools were successfully sequenced and the species identified. DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) was detected in Culex spp. and Culex vaxus pools, while ZIKV was identified in An. cruzii, Limatus durhamii and Wy. confusa pools. To the best of our knowledge, detection of flavivirus species of medical importance has never previously been reported in these species of wild-caught mosquitoes. The finding of DENV-2 and ZIKV circulating in wild mosquitoes suggests the existence of an enzootic cycle in the area. In-depth studies of DENV-2 and ZIKV, including investigation of mosquito infection, vector competence and infection in sylvatic hosts, are needed to shed light on the transmission dynamics of these important viruses and the potential risk of future outbreaks of DENV-2 and ZIKV infections in the region.

Methods In total, 116 patients with stage I-III rectal cancer who underwent preoperative CCRT and robotic-assisted surgery between September 2013 and February 2019 were enrolled. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the time interval: group A (10-12 weeks) and group B (>= 12 weeks). Results Among the 116 enrolled patients, 98 (84.5%) had middle and lower rectal cancers. Two (1.7%) patients underwent abdominoperineal resection with a sphincter preservation rate of 98.3%. Thirty-seven (31.9%) patients had a pathologic complete response (pCR). The circumferential resection margin and distal resection margin were positive in 2 (1.7%) and 1 (0.9%) patients, respectively. Therefore, the R0 resection rate was 97.4%. A total of 24 (22.4%) patients experienced postoperative relapse and 12 (10.3%) patients died; these were slightly more common in group B than in group A (28.8% vs 15.8% and 15.3% vs 5.3%, respectively; bothP> 0.05); however, this difference was nonsignificant. Three-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% and 89%, respectively, among all patients. Non-significant trend of favorable 3-year DFS, 3-year OS, 3-year locoregional control rate and 3-year distant metastasis control rate were observed in group A compared with group B (allP> 0.05). Conclusion Robotic-assisted surgery after a longer interval is safe and feasible for patients with rectal cancer undergoing preoperative CCRT. The present study's results suggested that the time interval of 10-12 weeks can be considered because comparable clinical and perioperative outcomes and preferable oncological outcomes were observed for interval of this length. However, future prospective randomized clinical trials are required to verify the present finding.

Expression and function of mechanosensitive ion channels in human valve interstitial cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELEVATED CYCLIC STRETCH; MATRIX; STRESS; CALCIFICATION; STRAIN; TRPV4	Background The ability of heart valve cells to respond to their mechanical environment represents a key mechanism by which the integrity and function of valve cusps is maintained. A number of different mechanotransduction pathways have been implicated in the response of valve cells to mechanical stimulation. In this study, we explore the expression pattern of several mechanosensitive ion channels (MSC) and their potential to mediate mechanosensitive responses of human valve interstitial cells (VIC). Methods MSC presence and function were probed using the patch clamp technique. Protein abundance of key MSC was evaluated by Western blotting in isolated fibroblastic VIC (VICFB) and in VIC differentiated towards myofibroblastic (VICMB) or osteoblastic (VICOB) phenotypes. Expression was compared in non-calcified and calcified human aortic valves. MSC contributions to stretch-induced collagen gene expression and to VIC migration were assessed by pharmacological inhibition of specific channels. Results Two MSC types were recorded in VICFB: potassium selective and cation non-selective channels. In keeping with functional data, the presence of both TREK-1 and Kir6.1 (potassium selective), as well as TRPM4, TRPV4 and TRPC6 (cationic non-selective) channels was confirmed in VIC at the protein level. Differentiation of VIC(FB)into VIC(MB)or VIC(OB)phenotypes was associated with a lower expression of TREK-1 and Kir6.1, and a higher expression of TRPV4 and TRPC6. Differences in MSC expression were also seen in non-calcifiedvscalcified aortic valves where TREK-1, TRPM4 and TRPV4 expression were higher in calcified compared to control tissues. Cyclic stretch-induced expression of COL I mRNA in cultured VIC(FB)was blocked by RN-9893, a selective inhibitor of TRPV4 channels while having no effect on the stretch-induced expression of COL III. VIC(FB)migration was blocked with the non-specific MSC blocker streptomycin and by GSK417651A an inhibitor of TRPC6/3. Conclusion Aortic VIC express a range of MSC that play a role in functional responses of these cells to mechanical stimulation. MSC expression levels differ in calcified and non-calcified valves in ways that are in part compatible with the change in expression seen between VIC phenotypes. These changes in MSC expression, and associated alterations in the ability of VIC to respond to their mechanical environment, may form novel targets for intervention during aortic valvulopathies.

Thus, we investigate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) associated with DPP-4i in low-risk patients with diabetes Methods Using a new-user retrospective cohort derived from IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (2010-2015), we identified patients aged 35-65 with type 2 diabetes, without cardiovascular or renal disease, initiating DPP-4i, sulfonylureas, or metformin. Primary composite outcome of time to first MACE was defined as the first of any of the following: myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary angioplasty, heart failure, and stroke. Secondary outcomes were time to first heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. We compared outcomes for DPP-4i versus sulfonylurea and DPP-4i versus metformin using propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographics, baseline comorbidities, concomitant medications, and cumulative exposure. Results Of 445,701 individuals, 236,431 (53.0%) were male, median age was 51 (interquartile range: [44, 57]), 30,267 (6.79%) initiated DPP-4i, 52,138 (11.70%) initiated sulfonylureas, and 367,908 (82.55%) initiated metformin. After adjustment, DPP-4i was associated with lower risk of MACE than sulfonylurea (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78-0.98), and similar risk to metformin (aHR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.97-1.18). Risk for acute myocardial infarction (aHR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51-0.96), stroke (aHR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41-0.79), and heart failure (aHR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41-0.79) with DPP-4i was lower compared to sulfonylureas. Conclusion Our findings show that for this cohort of low-risk patients newly treated for type 2 diabetes, DPP-4i exhibited 13% lower risk for MACE compared to sulfonylureas and similar risk for MACE compared to metformin, suggesting DPP-4i is a low cardiovascular risk option for low-risk patients initiating antihyperglycemic treatment.

However, this assumption differs with phylogenetic studies based on genetics. Embryonic characteristics, which are more stable, are commonly used to estimate the phylogeny and evolution of angiosperms. We studied the microsporogenesis, microgametogenesis, megasporogenesis and macrogametogenesis development ofC.serratifolia, and compared the early embryological characteristics amongC.serratifolia,C.serratifoliaand otherClematisspecies reported to provide a reference for the taxonomy of the genusClematis. Our results showed thatC.serratifoliaandC.glaucadiffer in megaspore formation and nucellus types suggesting that they have originated from different ancestors. The differences amongClematiswere mainly found in the type of the anther wall development, tapetum, pollen grains, megaspore formation and nucellus types.

Visual interpretation, not SUV ratios, is the ideal method to interpret 18F-DOPA PET scans to aid in the cure of patients with focal congenital hyperinsulinism	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BETA-CELL HYPERPLASIA; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; HYPOGLYCEMIA; INFANCY; PANCREATECTOMY; DIAGNOSIS; LOCALIZATION; OCTREOTIDE; TERM	Introduction Congenital hyperinsulinism is characterized by abnormal regulation of insulin secretion from the pancreas causing profound hypoketotic hypoglycemia and is the leading cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children. The main objective of this study is to highlight the different mechanisms to interpret the F-18-DOPA PET scans and how this can influence outcomes. Materials and methods After F-18-Fluoro-L-DOPA was injected intravenously into 50 subjects' arm at a dose of 2.96-5.92 MBq/kg, three to four single-bed position PET scans were acquired at 20, 30, 40 and 50-minute post injection. The radiologist interpreted the scans for focal and diffuse hyperinsulinism using a visual interpretation method, as well as determining the Standard Uptake Value ratios with varying cut-offs. Results Visual interpretation had the combination of the best sensitivity and positive prediction values. Conclusions In patients with focal disease, SUV ratios are not as accurate in identifying the focal lesion as visual inspection, and cases of focal disease may be missed by those relying on SUV ratios, thereby denying the patients a chance of cure. We recommend treating patients with diazoxide-resistant hyperinsulinism in centers with dedicated multidisciplinary team comprising of at least a pediatric endocrinologist with a special interest in hyperinsulinism, a radiologist experienced in interpretation of F-18-Fluoro-L-DOPA PET/CT scans, a histopathologist with experience in frozen section analysis of the pancreas and a pancreatic surgeon experienced in partial pancreatectomies in patients with hyperinsulinism.

III. Time-domain responses: Constancy, dynamics, and precision in relation to spectral resolution, and perception in the time domain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AUDITORY MIDBRAIN; CENTRAL NUCLEUS; INTRINSIC-PROPERTIES; GAP DETECTION; HOUSE MOUSE; DURATION DISCRIMINATION; COMMUNICATION CALLS; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; IDENTIFIED NEURONS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION	The auditory midbrain (central nucleus of inferior colliculus, ICC) receives multiple brainstem projections and recodes auditory information for perception in higher centers. Many neural response characteristics are represented in gradients (maps) in the three-dimensional ICC space. Map overlap suggests that neurons, depending on their ICC location, encode information in several domains simultaneously by different aspects of their responses. Thus, interdependence of coding, e.g. in spectral and temporal domains, seems to be a general ICC principle. Studies on covariation of response properties and possible impact on sound perception are, however, rare. Here, we evaluated tone-evoked single neuron activity from the mouse ICC and compared shapes of excitatory frequency-response areas (including strength and shape of inhibition within and around the excitatory area; classes I, II, III) with types of temporal response patterns and first-spike response latencies. Analyses showed covariation of sharpness of frequency tuning with constancy and precision of responding to tone onsets. Highest precision (first-spike latency jitter < 1 ms) and stable phasic responses throughout frequency-response areas were the quality mainly of class III neurons with broad frequency tuning, least influenced by inhibition. Class II neurons with narrow frequency tuning and dominating inhibitory influence were unsuitable for time domain coding with high precision. The ICC center seems specialized rather for high spectral resolution (class II presence), lateral parts for constantly precise responding to sound onsets (class III presence). Further, the variation of tone-response latencies in the frequency-response areas of individual neurons with phasic, tonic, phasic-tonic, or pauser responses gave rise to the definition of a core area, which represented a time window of about 20 ms from tone onset for tone-onset responding of the whole ICC. This time window corresponds to the roughly 20 ms shortest time interval that was found critical in several auditory perceptual tasks in humans and mice.

Here, we topically sensitized female ND4 Swiss mice to the common household and industrial preservative methylisothiazolinone (MI) and subsequently challenged them daily with MI or acetone and olive oil vehicle on the labiar skin. MI-challenged mice developed significant, persistent tactile sensitivity and long-lasting local accumulation of mast cells alongside early, transient increases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therapeutic administration of imatinib, a c-Kit inhibitor known to inhibit mast cell survival, led to reduced mast cell accumulation and alleviated tactile genital pain. We provide the first pre-clinical evidence of dermal MI-induced mast-cell dependent pain and lay the groundwork for detailed understanding of these intersections between MI-driven immunomodulation and chronic pain.

We estimated the optimal timing interval for IRS using a statistical approach. Methods Six rounds of IRS were implemented in Tororo District, a historically high malaria transmission setting in Uganda, during the study period (3 rounds with bendiocarb active ingredient (Ficam (R)): December 2014 to December 2015, and 3 rounds with pirimiphos methyl active ingredient (Actellic 300 (R) CS): June 2016 to July 2018). A generalized additive model was used to estimate the optimal timing interval for IRS based on the predicted malaria incidence. The model was fitted to clinical incidence data from a cohort of children aged 0.5-10 years from selected households observed throughout the study period. Results 494 children, 67% aged less than 5 years at enrolment were analysed. Six-months period incidence of malaria decreased from 2.96 per person-years at the baseline to 1.74 following the first round of IRS and then to 0.02 after 6 rounds of IRS. The optimal time interval for IRS differed between bendiocarb and pirimiphos methyl and by IRS round. To retain an optimum impact, bendiocarb would require respraying 17 (95% CI: 14.2-21.0) weeks after application whereas pirimiphos methyl could remain impactful for 40 (95% CI: 37.0-42.8) weeks, although in the final year this estimates 36 (95% CI: 32.7-37.7) weeks. However, we could not estimate from the data the optimal time after the second and third rounds of bendiocarb and after the second round of pirimiphos methyl. Neither the amount of rainfall nor the EIR nor the distribution of nets were found to be statistically significant for determining the time period between spray rounds. Conclusion In our setting, the effect of the two IRS products was distinct. Statistically, pirimiphos methyl provided a longer window of protection than bendiocarb, although impact varied between different spray rounds and years which was not explained by rainfall or EIR or distribution of nets in our statistical approach. Understanding the effectiveness of IRS and how long it lasts can help for planning campaigns, but one should consider the financial cost and insecticide resistance. Monitoring the timing of spray campaigns using clinical incidence could be repeated in future programs to help determine the average period of protectivity of these products.

Ee			Physiochemical characterization and systematic investigation of metals extraction from fly and bottom ashes produced from municipal solid waste	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION; HEAVY-METALS; COAL; REMOVAL; OPTIMIZATION; COMBUSTION; SEDIMENTS; MOBILITY; SLUDGE	Incineration has emerged as one of the acceptable ways to treat municipal solid waste (MSW) due to its potential in reducing the mass and volume of the waste. However, it produces two major by-product residues, namely MSW-bottom ash (MSW-BA) and MSW-fly ash (MSW-FA). These residues have gained great attention to their hazardous nature and potential to be reused and recycled. In this paper, the physicochemical characterizations of the MSW-BA and the MSW-FA were performed, followed by a systematic investigation of metals extraction from MSW-BA and MSW-FA. Various extracting agents were used to investigate the possibility to extract 21 metals including cadmium (Cd), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb). It was revealed that some metals were present in a high amount in the MSW-BA while other metals were higher in the MSW-FA. Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results revealed that the MSW-BA was dominated by oxygen (O) 55.4 +/- 0.6 wt%, silicon (Si) 22.5 +/- 0.3 wt%, and calcium (Ca) 18.5 +/- 0.2 wt%. On the other hand, the MSW-FA was enriched with Ca 45.2 +/- 0.5 wt%, and O 40.3 +/- 0.4 wt%. From the scanning electron microscopy, the MSW-BA was observed as flaky with an irregular surface that consisted of large pores, while, the MSW-FA was present as agglomerated particles and had a bimodal distribution. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that Al-Fe-OH, Al-Al-OH, Si-O, C-O, and C-H were some of the major functional groups present in the ashes. The F-tests concluded that the metal extraction from the MSW-BA and MSW-FA were significantly affected by the acid type. it is concluded that nitric acid and phosphoric acid were the best-suited acid for the MSW-BA while sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid for the MSW-FA. More than 11 wt% of Cd and 9 wt% of Cu were extracted from MSW-BA while 6 wt% of Pb and 4.5 wt% of V were extracted from the MSW-FA. The present methodology is an interesting development in metal extraction from the MSW-BA and the MSW-FA, which can develop in a cost-effective and sustainable option to utilize MSW.

Minimal structural elements required for midline repulsive signaling and regulation ofDrosophilaRobo1	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VIVO FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; CONTROL AXON REPULSION; DROSOPHILA ROBO1; ROUNDABOUT RECEPTOR; GUIDANCE; SLIT; BINDING; ROLES; COMMISSURELESS; NETRIN-1	The Roundabout (Robo) family of axon guidance receptors has a conserved ectodomain arrangement of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains plus three fibronectin type III (Fn) repeats. Based on the strong evolutionary conservation of this domain structure among Robo receptors, as well asin vitrostructural and domain-domain interaction studies of Robo family members, this ectodomain arrangement is predicted to be important for Robo receptor signaling in response to Slit ligands. Here, we define the minimal ectodomain structure required for Slit binding and midline repulsive signalingin vivobyDrosophilaRobo1. We find that the majority of the Robo1 ectodomain is dispensable for both Slit binding and repulsive signaling. We show that a significant level of midline repulsive signaling activity is retained when all Robo1 ectodomain elements apart from Ig1 are deleted, and that the combination of Ig1 plus one additional ectodomain element (Ig2, Ig5, or Fn3) is sufficient to restore midline repulsion to wild type levels. Further, we find that deleting four out of five Robo1 Ig domains (Delta Ig2-5) does not affect negative regulation of Robo1 by Commissureless (Comm) or Robo2, while variants lacking all three fibronectin repeats (Delta Fn1-3 and Delta Ig2-Fn3) are insensitive to regulation by both Comm and Robo2, signifying a novel regulatory role for Robo1's Fn repeats. Our results provide anin vivoperspective on the importance of the conserved 5+3 ectodomain structure of Robo receptors, and suggest that specific biochemical properties and/or ectodomain structural conformations observedin vitrofor domains other than Ig1 may have limited significance forin vivosignaling in the context of midline repulsion.

J	Hallinan, E; Shaw, M				Hallinan, Emily; Shaw, Matthew			Nubian Levallois reduction strategies in the Tankwa Karoo, South Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MIDDLE STONE-AGE; POST-HOWIESONS POORT; LATE PLEISTOCENE ARCHAEOLOGY; EASTERN LIBYAN PLATEAU; ROCK-VARNISH; WESTERN CAPE; LITHIC TECHNOLOGY; DESERT PAVEMENTS; NILE CORRIDOR; DORING RIVER	The Middle Stone Age record in southern Africa is recognising increasing diversity in lithic technologies as research expands beyond the coastal-montane zone. New research in the arid Tankwa Karoo region of the South African interior has revealed a rich surface artefact record including a novel method of point production, recognised as Nubian Levallois technology in Late Pleistocene North Africa, Arabia and the Levant. We analyse 121 Nubian cores and associated points from the surface site Tweefontein against the strict criteria which are used to define Nubian technology elsewhere. The co-occurrence of typically post-Howiesons Poort unifacial points suggests an MIS 3 age. We propose that the occurrence of this distinctive technology at numerous localities in the Tankwa Karoo region reflects an environment-specific adaptation in line with technological regionalisation seen more widely in MIS 3. The arid setting of these assemblages in the Tankwa Karoo compares with the desert context of Nubian technology globally, consistent with convergent evolution in our case. The South African evidence contributes an alternative perspective on Nubian technology removed from the 'dispersal' or 'diffusion' scenarios of the debate surrounding its origin and spread within and out of Africa.

J	Shibre, G				Shibre, Gebretsadik			Social inequality in infant mortality in Angola: Evidence from a population based study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRENDS; SEX	Introduction Within country inequality in infant mortality poses a big challenge for countries moving towards the internationally agreed upon targets on child mortality by 2030. There is a lack of high-quality evidence on infant mortality measured through different dimensions of social inequality in Angola. Thus, this paper was carried out to address the knowledge gap by conducting in-depth examination of infant mortality rate (IMR) inequality among population subgroups to provide more nuanced evidence to help end IMR disparity in the country. Methods The World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) was used to analyze IMR inequality. HEAT is a software application that facilitates examination of disparities in reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health indicators using the WHO Health Equity Monitor (HEM) database. Inequality of IMR was analyzed through disaggregation by five equity stratifiers: education, wealth, gender, subnational region and residence. These were analyzed through three inequality measures: Population Attributable Risk, Ratio and Slope Index of Inequality. A 95% confidence Interval (CI) was built around point estimates to determine statistical significance. Results A notable disadvantage was found for children born to poor (Population Attributable Risk (PAR): -27.0; -28.4, -26.0) and uneducated (PAR: -17.0; -17.9, -16.0), women who live in rural areas (PAR: -7.3;-7.8, -6.7) and those residing in certain regions of the country (PAR: -43.0; 45.3, -4). Male infants had a higher risk of death than female infants (PAR: -6.8;-7.5, -6.2). The subnational regional variation of IMR had been the most evident when compared with the disparities in the other equity stratifers. Conclusions Policymakers and planners need to address the disproportionately higher clustering of IMR among infants born to disadvantaged subpopulations through interventions that benefit such subgroups.

Use of aromatase inhibitors is recommended to prevent the potential effects of elevated serum estradiol levels and recurrence of tumor in patients with estrogen-dependent cancers during COS. Although previous studies reported that letrozole have shown an effective lowering of peak estrogen levels, a part of patients shows supraphysiologic levels of estrogen associated with ovarian stimulation despite the administration of letrozole. From January 2009 to December 2019, patients with estrogen-dependent cancer who underwent COS with antagonist protocol using a letrozole (5 mg/ day) to keep estrogen levels low were included in this study. Early monitoring serum estradiol was measured in all patients on the 4-6th day of stimulation. Subjects were classified into two groups according to the serum estradiol level on hCG triggering day, physiologic estradiol group (<= 400 pg/mL) and supraphysiologic estradiol group (>400 pg/mL). A total of 96 COS cycles were retrospectively analyzed. Supraphysiologic level of serum estradiol was found in 21.9% of the patients. Mean age, AMH, duration of stimulation, total dose of gonadotropins administered were not different between the two groups. However, early monitoring serum estradiol level was significantly higher in the supraphysiologic estradiol group (67.1 +/- 47.9 vs. 115.6 +/- 78.1, p = 0.001) and was associated with the occurrence of supraphysiologic elevation of serum estradiol on hCG triggering day. Patients with early monitoring serum estradiol >= 84.5 pg/mL had an odds ratio of 5.376 [95% CI, 1.613-17.913] for supraphysiologic elevation of serum estradiol compared to those with early monitoring serum estradiol below 84.5 pg/mL. In conclusion, early monitoring serum estradiol is an independent predicting factor for supraphysiologic level of serum estradiol on hCG triggering day in the COS cycles using letrozole and gonadotropins.

Nonetheless, not all patients with OCD significantly benefit from CBT. This has generated interest in the potential benefits of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs), either integrated with CBT, to enhance engagement with ERP tasks, or delivered as a stand-alone, first-line or therapy to augment CBT. This paper reports on two qualitative studies that involved a thematic analysis of interview data with participants in a 10-week Mindfulness-Based ERP (MB-ERP) course (study 1) and a 9-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy course adapted for OCD (MBCT-OCD) (study 2). Whilst MB-ERP integrated a mindfulness component into a standard ERP protocol, MBCT-OCD adapted the psychoeducational components of the standard MBCT for depression protocol to suit OCD, but without explicit ERP tasks. Three common main themes emerged across MB-ERP and MBCT-OCD: 'satisfaction with course features', 'acceptability of key therapeutic tasks 'and 'using mindfulness to respond differently to OCD'. Sub-themes identified under the first two main themes were mostly unique to MB-ERP or MBCT-OCD, with the exception of '(struggles with) developing a mindfulness practice routine' whilst most of the sub-themes under the last main theme were shared across MB-ERP and MBCT-OCD participants. Findings suggested that participants generally perceived both MBIs as acceptable and potentially beneficial treatments for OCD, in line with theorised mechanisms of change.

J	Verma, VR; Dash, U				Verma, Veenapani Rajeev; Dash, Umakant			Geographical accessibility and spatial coverage modelling of public health care network in rural and remote India	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ACCESS; AFRICA; AREAS	Background Long distances to facilities, topographical constraints, inadequate service capacity of institutions and insufficient/ rudimentary road & transportation network culminate into unprecedented barriers to access. These barriers gets exacerbated in presence of external factors like conflict and political disruptions. Thus, this study was conducted in rural, remote and fragile region in India measuring geographical accessibility and modelling spatial coverage of public healthcare network. Methods Vector and raster based approaches were used to discern accessibility for various packages of service delivery. Alternative scenarios derived from local experiences were modelled using health facility, population and ancillary data. Based on that, a raster surface of travel time between facilities and population was developed by incorporating terrain, physical barriers, topography and travelling modes and speeds through various land-cover classes. Concomitantly, spatial coverage was modelled to delineate catchment areas. Further, underserved population and zonal statistics were assessed in an interactive modelling approach to ascertain spatial relationship between population, travel time and zonal boundaries. Finally, raster surface of travel time was re-modelled for the conflict situation in villages vulnerable to obstruction of access due to disturbed security scenario. Results Euclidean buffers revealed 11% villages without ambulatory & immunization care within 2 km radius. Similarly, for 5 km radius, 11% and 12% villages were bereft of delivery and inpatient care. Travel time accessibility analysis divulged walking scenario exhibiting lowest level of accessibility. Enabling motorized travel improved accessibility measures, with highest degree of accessibility for privately owned vehicle (motorcycle and cars). Differential results were found between packages of services where ambulatory & immunization care was relatively accessible by walking; whereas, delivery and inpatient care had a staggering average of three hours walking time. Even with best scenario, around 2/3rd population remained unserved for all package of services. Moreover, 90% villages in conflict zone grapples with inaccessibility when the scenario of heightened border tensions was considered. Conclusions Our study demonstrated the application of GIS technique to facilitate evidence backed planning at granular level. Regardless of the scenario, the analysis divulged inaccessibility to delivery and inpatient care to be most pronounced and majority of population to be unserved. It was suggested to have concerted efforts to bolster already existing facilities and adapt systems approach to exploit synergies of inter-sectoral development.

The novel strain of the coronavirus disease is transmittable at a devastating rate with a high rate of severe hospitalization even more so for the elderly population. Naso-oro-pharyngeal swab samples as the first step towards detecting suspected infection of SARS-CoV-2 provides a non-invasive method for PCR testing at a high confidence rate. Furthermore, proteomics analysis of PCR positive and negative naso-oropharyngeal samples provides information on the molecular level which highlights disease pathology. Samples from 15 PCR positive cases and 15 PCR negative cases were analyzed with nanoLC-MS/MS to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Proteomic analyses identified 207 proteins across the sample set and 17 of them were statistically significant. Protein-protein interaction analyses emphasized pathways like Neutrophil degranulation, Innate Immune System, Antimicrobial Peptides. Neutrophil Elastase (ELANE), Azurocidin (AZU1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Myeloblastin (PRTN3), Cathepsin G (CTSG) and Transcobalamine-1 (TCN1) were found to be significantly altered in naso-oropharyngeal samples of SARS-CoV-2 patients. The identified proteins are linked to alteration in the innate immune system specifically via neutrophil degranulation and NETosis.

Evaluation of DNA markers for molecular identification of threePiperspecies from Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; BARCODE REGIONS; BENZOIC-ACID; SSR MARKERS; PIPER; TRANSFERABILITY	Piperis one of two large genera in the Piperaceae, and with ca. 2600 species, is one of the largest plant genera in the world. Species delimitation and evaluation of genetic diversity among populations are important requisites for conservation and adequate exploitation of economically important species. DNA barcoding has been used as a powerful tool and a practical method for species characterization and delimitation. The present work aims to evaluate molecular markers for barcoding threePiperspecies native to Brazil:P.gaudichaudianum("jaborandi" or "pariparoba"),P.malacophyllum("pariparoba-murta") andP.regnellii("caapeba" or "pariparoba"). A reference DNA barcode library was developed using sequences of three candidate regions: ITS2,trnH-psbAandrbcL. Transferability of the microsatellite (SSR) primers Psol 3, Psol 6 and Psol 10, designed originally forPiper solmsianum, to the threePiperspecies was also evaluated. The discriminatory power of the markers was based on the determination of inter- and intraspecific distances, phylogenetic reconstruction, and clustering analysis, as well as BLASTn comparison. Sequences of ITS2 enabled efficient species identification by means of the BLASTn procedure. Based on these sequences, intraspecific divergence was lower than interspecific variation. Maximum Parsimony analyses based on ITS2 sequences provided three resolved clades, each corresponding to one of the three analysed species. Sequences oftrnH-psbAandrbcLhad lower discriminatory value. Analyses combining sequences of these regions were less effective toward the attainment of resolved and strongly supported clades of all species. In summary, robustly supported clades ofP.regnelliiwere obtained in most of the analyses, based either on isolated or combined sequences. The SSRs primers Psol 3, Psol 6 and Psol 10 were shown to be transferable toP.gaudichaudianumandP.regnellii, but not toP.malacophyllum.

Labr. is the most devastating disease of the crop in all chickpea growing areas across the continents. The pathogenA.rabieiis highly variable. The resistant sources available are not sufficient and new sources needs to be identified from time to time as resistance breakdown in existing chickpea varieties is very frequent due to fast evolution of new pathotypes of the pathogen. Therefore, this work was undertaken to evaluate the existing chickpea germplasm diversity conserved in Indian National Genebank against the disease under artificial epiphytotic conditions. An artificial standard inoculation procedure was followed for uniform spread of the pathogen. During the last fivewinterseasons from 2014-15 to 2018-19, a total of 1,970 accessions have been screened against the disease and promising accessions were identified and validated. Screening has resulted in identification of some promising chickpea accessions such as IC275447, IC117744, EC267301, IC248147 and EC220109 which have shown the disease resistance (disease severity score <= 3) in multiple seasons and locations. Promising accessions can serve as the potential donors in chickpea improvement programs. The frequency of resistant and moderately resistant type accessions was comparatively higher in accessions originated from Southwest Asian countries particularly Iran and Syria than the accessions originated from Indian sub-continent. Further large scale screening of chickpea germplasm originated from Southwest Asia may result in identifying new resistant sources for the disease.

We intend to explore whether citrulline (Cit) supplementation has protective effects on UC. Fifteen male Wistar rats were divided into normal control group (NC group), UC group and UC+Cit group, with five rats in each group. The UC model was established by TNBS/ethanol method. Rats in UC+Cit group were intragastrically administered with Cit for 7 consecutive days after modeling. All rats were sacrificed after 7 days. Blood samples were collected to detect the number of monocytes. Colon tissues were taken for HE staining. Immunohistochemistry staining for CD68 and p-STAT3 were performed to detect the infiltration of monocytes and the phosphorylation of STAT3 in colon tissues. The concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-17A and the protein expression of p-STAT3 in colon tissues were measured by ELISA and western blot methods, respectively. The body weight of UC group rats decreased significantly after 7 days (p<0.05). However, the weight loss of UC+Cit group rats was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The number of peripheral blood monocytes in UC+Cit group was significantly lower than that in UC group (p<0.05), and the infiltration of CD68-positive monocytes in the colon tissue of UC+Cit group was significantly reduced than that in UC group. The concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-17A and the expression of p-STAT3 in colon tissues of UC+Cit group rats were significantly lower than those in UC group (bothp<0.05). Our study suggests that Cit supplementation may be a potential therapy for UC.

Bioaccumulation and biomagnification of microplastics in marine organisms: A review and meta-analysis of current data	PLOS ONE			English	Review							POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; POLYSTYRENE MICROPLASTICS; GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; VIRGIN MICROPLASTICS; TROPHIC TRANSFER; INGESTION; FISH; SEA; ENVIRONMENT; CONTAMINATION	Microplastic (MP) contamination has been well documented across a range of habitats and for a large number of organisms in the marine environment. Consequently, bioaccumulation, and in particular biomagnification of MPs and associated chemical additives, are often inferred to occur in marine food webs. Presented here are the results of a systematic literature review to examine whether current, published findings support the premise that MPs and associated chemical additives bioaccumulate and biomagnify across a general marine food web. First, field and laboratory-derived contamination data on marine species were standardised by sample size from a total of 116 publications. Second, following assignment of each species to one of five main trophic levels, the average uptake of MPs and of associated chemical additives was estimated across all species within each level. These uptake data within and across the five trophic levels were then critically examined for any evidence of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Findings corroborate previous studies that MP bioaccumulation occurs within each trophic level, while current evidence around bioaccumulation of associated chemical additives is much more ambiguous. In contrast, MP biomagnification across a general marine food web is not supported by current field observations, while results from the few laboratory studies supporting trophic transfer are hampered by using unrealistic exposure conditions. Further, a lack of both field and laboratory data precludes an examination of potential trophic transfer and biomagnification of chemical additives associated with MPs. Combined, these findings indicate that, although bioaccumulation of MPs occurs within trophic levels, no clear sign of MP biomagnificationin situwas observed at the higher trophic levels. Recommendations for future studies to focus on investigating ingestion, retention and depuration rates for MPs and chemical additives under environmentally realistic conditions, and on examining the potential of multi-level trophic transfer for MPs and chemical additives have been made.

J	Galvin, JE; Tolea, MI; Chrisphonte, S				Galvin, James E.; Tolea, Magdalena I.; Chrisphonte, Stephanie			Using a patient-reported outcome to improve detection of cognitive impairment and dementia: The patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; BRIEF INFORMANT INTERVIEW; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; DISEASE; SELF; DECLINE; TOOL; AD8; RECOMMENDATIONS	Introduction Community detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) is a challenge. While Gold Standard assessments are commonly used in research centers, these methods are time consuming, require extensive training, and are not practical in most clinical settings or in community-based research projects. Many of these methods require an informant (e.g., spouse, adult child) to provide ratings of the patients' cognitive and functional abilities. A patient-reported outcome that captures the presence of cognitive impairment and corresponds to Gold Standard assessments could improve case ascertainment, clinical care, and recruitment into clinical research. We tested the patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) as a patient-reported outcome to detect MCI and ADRD. Methods The patient QDRS was validated in a sample of 261 consecutive patient-caregiver dyads compared with the informant version of the QDRS, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), neuropsychological tests, and Gold Standard measures of function, behavior, and mood. Psychometric properties including item variability, floor and ceiling effects, construct, concurrent, and known-groups validity, and internal consistency were determined. Results The patient QDRS strongly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognition, function, mood, behavior, and global staging methods (p-values < .001) and had strong psychometric properties with excellent data quality and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.923, 95%CI:0.91-0.94). The patient QDRS had excellent agreement with the informant QDRS, the CDR and its sum of boxes (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 9.781-0.876). Receiver operator characteristic curves showed excellent discrimination between normal controls from CDR 0.5 (AUC:0.820;95% CI: 0.74-0.90) and for normal controls from any cognitive impairment (AUC:0.885;95% CI: 0.83-0.94). Discussion The patient QDRS validly and reliably differentiates individuals with and without cognitive impairment and can be completed by patients through all stages of dementia. The patient QDRS is highly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognitive, function, behavior, and global staging. The patient QDRS provides a rapid method to screen patients for MCI and ADRD in clinical practice, determine study eligibility, improve case ascertainment in community studies.

Defining the sediment prokaryotic communities of the Indian River Lagoon, FL, USA, an Estuary of National Significance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ST-LUCIE ESTUARY; HEAVY-METALS; GEN. NOV.; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; SOUTH FLORIDA; WATER; CONTAMINATION; SOLUBILITY; COASTAL	The Indian River Lagoon, located on the east coast of Florida, USA, is an Estuary of National Significance and an important economic and ecological resource. The Indian River Lagoon faces several environmental pressures, including freshwater discharges through the St. Lucie Estuary; accumulation of anoxic, fine-grained, organic-rich sediment; and metal contamination from agriculture and marinas. Although the Indian River Lagoon has been well-studied, little is known about its microbial communities; thus, a two-year 16S amplicon sequencing study was conducted to assess the spatiotemporal changes of the sediment bacterial and archaeal groups. In general, the Indian River Lagoon exhibited a prokaryotic community that was consistent with other estuarine studies. Statistically different communities were found between the Indian River Lagoon and St. Lucie Estuary due to changes in porewater salinity causing microbes that require salts for growth to be higher in the Indian River Lagoon. The St. Lucie Estuary exhibited more obvious prokaryotic seasonality, such as a higher relative abundance of Betaproteobacteriales in wet season and a higher relative abundance of Flavobacteriales in dry season samples. Distance-based linear models revealed these communities were more affected by changes in total organic matter and copper than changes in temperature. Anaerobic prokaryotes, such as Campylobacterales, were more associated with high total organic matter and copper samples while aerobic prokaryotes, such as Nitrosopumilales, were more associated with low total organic matter and copper samples. This initial study fills the knowledge gap on the Indian River Lagoon bacterial and archaeal communities and serves as important data for future studies to compare to determine possible future changes due to human impacts or environmental changes.

Although there have been many investigations of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in various diseases, its role in predicting the development of pouchitis remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of the NLR for predicting the development of pouchitis after IPAA in UC patients. Materials and methods UC patients who underwent IPAA at Osaka City University Hospital between May 2006 and March 2019 were included. The incidence of pouchitis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Potential preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative predictors for pouchitis, including various demographic and clinical variables, were analyzed. The combined impact of the NLR and other known prognostic factors were investigated using Cox proportional hazard regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Results Forty-nine patients with UC who underwent IPAA were included. The median follow-up period was 18.3 months (interquartile range: 10.7-47.2 months). Eighteen patients (36.7%) developed pouchitis. The incidence of pouchitis was 19.2%, 32.6%, and 45.9% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. NLR was significantly associated with the development of pouchitis in the univariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.28; P = 0.03). The NLR cutoff value of 2.15 was predictive of the development of pouchitis according to receiver operating characteristic analysis (specificity: 67.7%, sensitivity: 72.2%). The incidence of pouchitis was significantly lower in the low NLR group than that in the high NLR group (P = 0.01, log-rank test). Cox regression analyses using IPTW also identified NLR as a prognostic factor for the development of pouchitis by statistically adjusting for background factors (HR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.31-9.89; P = 0.01). Conclusions NLR may be a novel and useful indicator for predicting the development of pouchitis after IPAA in UC and should be introduced in clinical practice.

Samples (n = 595) of cereals, pulses, and oil seeds were collected from 160 households across four diverse districts of India and analyzed for aflatoxin B1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Demographic information, food and cropping systems, food management behaviors, and storage environments were profiled for each household. An aflatoxin detection risk index was developed based on household-level features and validated using a repeated 5-fold cross-validation approach. Across districts, between 30-80% of households yielded at least one contaminated sample. Aflatoxin B1 detection rates and mean contamination levels were highest in groundnut and maize, respectively, and lower in other crops. Landholding had a positive univariate effect on household aflatoxin detection, while storage conditions, product source, and the number of protective behaviors used by households did not show significant effects. Presence of groundnut, post-harvest grain washing, use of sack-based storage systems, and cultivation status (farming or non-farming) were identified as the most contributive variables in stepwise logistic regression and were used to generate a household-level risk index. The index had moderate classification accuracy (68% sensitivity and 62% specificity) and significantly correlated with village-wise aflatoxin detection rates. Spatial analysis revealed utility of the index for identifying at-risk localities and households. This study identified several key features associated with aflatoxin contamination in Indian food systems and demonstrated that household characteristics are substantially predictive of aflatoxin risk.

Quantitative definition of neurobehavior, vision, hearing and brain volumes in macaques congenitally exposed to Zika virus	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRENATAL STRESS; RHESUS; INFECTION; INFANTS; SEGMENTATION; LESIONS; IMPACT; MODEL	Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure results in a spectrum of disease ranging from severe birth defects to delayed onset neurodevelopmental deficits. ZIKV-related neuropathogenesis, predictors of birth defects, and neurodevelopmental deficits are not well defined in people. Here we assess the methodological and statistical feasibility of a congenital ZIKV exposure macaque model for identifying infant neurobehavior and brain abnormalities that may underlie neurodevelopmental deficits. We inoculated five pregnant macaques with ZIKV and mock-inoculated one macaque in the first trimester. Following birth, growth, ocular structure/function, brain structure, hearing, histopathology, and neurobehavior were quantitatively assessed during the first week of life. We identified the typical pregnancy outcomes of congenital ZIKV infection, with fetal demise and placental abnormalities. We estimated sample sizes needed to define differences between groups and demonstrated that future studies quantifying brain region volumes, retinal structure, hearing, and visual pathway function require a sample size of 14 animals per group (14 ZIKV, 14 control) to detect statistically significant differences in at least half of the infant exam parameters. Establishing the parameters for future studies of neurodevelopmental outcomes following congenital ZIKV exposure in macaques is essential for robust and rigorous experimental design.

To address this growing NCD burden, primary health care (PHC) systems will require substantial re-orientation. In this study, we reviewed the progress of African countries towards integrating essential NCD services into PHC. Methods A review of World Health Organization (WHO) reports was conducted for all 47 countries in the WHO African Region. To report each country's progress, we used an a priori framework developed by the WHO regional office for Africa (AFRO). Twelve indicators were used to measure countries' progress. The proportion of countries meeting each indicator was tabulated using a heat map. Correlation between country income status and attainment of each indicator was also assessed. Findings No country met all the recommended indicators to integrate NCD services into PHC and seven countries met none of the indicators. Few countries (30%) had nationally approved guidelines for NCD management and very few reported availabilities of all essential NCD medicines (13%) and technologies (11%) in PHC facilities. There was no overall correlation between a country's GDP per capita and the aggregate of targets being met (rho = 0.23; P =.12). There was, however, a modestly negative correlation between out-of-pocket expenditure and overall country progress (rho = -0.58; P <.001). Conclusion Progress by AFRO Member States in integrating NCD care into PHC is variable across the region. Enhanced government commitment and judicious resource allocation to prioritize NCDs are needed. Particular areas of focus include increasing the uptake of simplified guidelines for NCDs; increasing workforce capacity to manage NCDs; and removing access barriers to essential medicines and basic diagnostic technologies.

However, the biological mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, mRNA sequencing was used to screen differentially expressed genes in the germination process ofAndrographis paniculataseeds treated with air plasma (power density = 8.99 J/cm(3)). Following plasma treatment, the germination percentages were significantly higher than those of the control, they were 3.5 +/- 0.6%vs. 0 at 28 hours after sowing (HAS) and 50.3 +/- 2.6%vs. 37.3 +/- 1.7% at 48 HAS. After unigenes were assembled and annotated, 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected at 28 HAS, compared with nine DEGs at 48 HAS, but no DEGs were detected at 0 HAS, indicating that air plasma treatment mainly changed the gene expression ofA.paniculataseeds at 28 HAS. TheNCED5expression level of the treated group was less than one-fifth of the control, and the expressions of three ethylene response factors were significantly higher than the control at 28 HAS, indicating that lower abscisic acid levels play an important role and ethylene signal transduction also participates in radicle protrusion.ACO,NRT1andPRP3expressions were significantly higher than in the control at 48 HAS, suggesting that higher ethylene levels cause the endosperm cap to weaken and start to grow root hairs and lateral roots earlier. These findings reveal that plasma promotes seed germination mainly by regulating the expression of hormone-related genes. And the possible signal transduction of related hormones was discussed.

J	Baird, ME; Green, R; Lowe, R; Mongin, M; Bougeot, E				Baird, Mark Edward; Green, Rebecca; Lowe, Ryan; Mongin, Mathieu; Bougeot, Elodie			Optimising cool-water injections to reduce thermal stress on coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef	PLOS ONE			English	Review							MODEL; TIME; AGE	Coral bleaching driven by ocean warming is one of the most visible ecological impacts of climate change and perhaps the greatest threat to the persistence of reefs in the coming decades. In the absence of returning atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to those compatible with ocean temperatures below the mass coral bleaching temperature thresholds, the most straightforward means to reduce thermal-stress induced bleaching is to cool water at the seabed. The feasibility of reducing the seabed temperature through cool-water injections is considered first by analysing the feasibility of doing so on 19 reefs with differing physical environments using a simple residence time metric in 200 m resolution hydrodynamic model configurations. We then concentrate on the reefs around Lizard Island, the most promising candidate of the 19 locations, and develop a 40 m hydrodynamic model to investigate the effect of the injection of cool water at differing volumetric rates. Injecting 27 degrees C seawater at a rate of 5 m(3)s(-1)at 4 sites in early 2017 cooled 97 ha of the reef by 0.15 degrees C or more. The power required to pump 5 m(3)s(-1)through a set of pipes over a distance of 3 km from a nearby channel is similar to 466 kW. This power applied at 4 sites for 3 months achieves a 2 Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) reduction on 97 ha of reef. A more precise energy costing will require further expert engineering design of the pumping equipment and energy sources. Even for the most physically favourable reefs, cool-water transported through pipes and injected at a reef site is energy expensive and cannot be scaled up to any meaningful fraction of the 3,100 reefs of the GBR. Should priority be given to reducing thermal stress on one or a few high value reefs, this paper provides a framework to identify the most promising sites.

Identification of antibiotics for use in selection of the chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEAMINASE GENE BSD; SELECTABLE MARKER; CHLAMYDOMONAS-REINHARDTII; HYGROMYCIN-RESISTANCE; INDUCIBLE EXPRESSION; TRANSFORMATION; NEOMYCIN; CELLS; ACTIVATION; ECOSYSTEMS	Global amphibian populations are being decimated by chytridiomycosis, a deadly skin infection caused by the fungal pathogensBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis(Bd) andB.salamandrivorans(Bsal). Although ongoing efforts are attempting to limit the spread of these infections, targeted treatments are necessary to manage the disease. Currently, no tools for genetic manipulation are available to identify and test specific drug targets in these fungi. To facilitate the development of genetic tools in Bd and Bsal, we have tested five commonly used antibiotics with available resistance genes: Hygromycin, Blasticidin, Puromycin, Zeocin, and Neomycin. We have identified effective concentrations of each for selection in both liquid culture and on solid media. These concentrations are within the range of concentrations used for selecting genetically modified cells from a variety of other eukaryotic species.

To verify the main limiting factors of different macrosystems [temperature-limited Tibetan Plateau (TP), precipitation-limited Mongolian Plateau (MP), and nutrient-limited Loess Plateau (LP)], we conducted a comparative survey of the east-west grassland transects on the three plateaus and explored the factors limiting regional productivity and their underlying mechanisms. The results showed that aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of LP (109.10 +/- 16.76 g m(-2)yr(-1)) was significantly higher than that of MP (66.71 +/- 11.11 g m(-2)yr(-1)) and TP (57.02 +/- 10.59 g m(-2)yr(-1)). The response rate of ANPP with environmental changes was different among different plateaus, being closely related to the main limiting factors. On MP, this was precipitation, on LP it was temperature and nutrients, and on TP, it was non-specific, reflecting restriction by the extremely low temperature. After autocorrelation screening of environmental factors, different regions exhibited different productivity response mechanisms. MP was mainly influenced by temperature and precipitation, LP was influenced by temperature and nutrient, and TP was influenced by nutrient, reflecting the modifying effect of the main limiting factors. The effect of each regional environment on ANPP was 72.56% on average and only 27.18% after simple regional integration. The regional model could optimize the simulation error of the integrated model, and the relative deviations in MP, LP, and TP were reduced by 31.76%, 17.22%, and 2.23%, respectively. These findings indicate that the grasslands on the three plateaus may have different or even the opposite mechanisms to control productivity.

In practice, it can be difficult or impossible for the public to exercise this right. We present JUSTFAIR: Judicial System Transparency through Federal Archive Inferred Records, a database of criminal sentencing decisions made in federal district courts. We have compiled this data set from public sources including the United States Sentencing Commission, the Federal Judicial Center, the Public Access to Court Electronic Records system, and Wikipedia. With nearly 600,000 records from the years 2001-2018, JUSTFAIR is the first large scale, free, public database that links information about defendants and their demographic characteristics with information about their federal crimes, their sentences, and, crucially, the identity of the sentencing judge.

The study evaluated the selection of a potential bacterial strain from Sepetiba Bay-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil marine sediments to remove Cu and Pb. The bacterial strain isolated from the sediments was used in three different bioassays: (1) Cu at concentrations of 0 (control), 6 and 50 mu g.mL(-1); (2) Pb at concentrations of 0 (control), 6 and 50 mu g.mL(-1); (3) Cu + Pb in concentrations of 3 mu g.mL(-1) Cu + 3 mu g.mL(-1) Pb (6 mu g.mL(-1)) and 25 mu g.mL(-1) Cu + 25 mu g.mL(-1) Pb (50 mu g.mL(-1)). The number of cells and the enzymatic activities of dehydrogenases and esterases were quantified. Results of taxonomic identification indicated the selection of the Pseudomonas stutzeri W228 strain, showing a greater degree of similarity (+/- 73%) with the database used. There was no significant variation in the number of cells, 10(8) cells.mL(-1), which represents a high biomass production in the presence of stressors. However, we observed a reduction in dehydrogenase activity at all tested concentrations of Cu, Pb and Cu + Pb. The activity of esterase increased, indicating a higher energy demand to complete the bacterial life cycle. The study showed significant results for the absorption of Pb by the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the efflux of Cu. The capacity of Pb absorption by EPS can be considered a resistance mechanism, as well as the efflux of Cu, so that the available EPS sites could be occupied by the most toxic ions demonstrating that Pseudomonas stutzeri is resistant to Pb and Cu.

Community disruption in small biogenic habitats: A coastal invader overcomes habitat complexity to alter community structure	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CRAB CARCINUS-MAENAS; INTERTIDAL MUSSEL BEDS; INVASIVE GREEN CRAB; MYTILUS-EDULIS; SOFT-BOTTOM; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; PREDATORS; IMPACTS; SEDIMENT	Non-indigenous species are often identified as threats to native species and communities. Yet, the mechanisms that enable many of these invaders to thrive and alter their newly invaded habitats are still not fully understood. This applies to habitats such as widespread sedimentary shorelines characterized by the presence of scattered biogenic clumps of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) structurally more complex than bare sediments. In Atlantic Canada, some of these shorelines are numerically dominated by native mud crabs (Dyspanopeus sayi) but have been gradually invaded by the European green crab (Carcinus maenas). This study describes between-habitat (mussel clump vs. bare sediment) differences in density and diversity of invertebrates. It also tests the impact of juvenile green crabs in comparison to native mud crabs using two approaches: First, measuring habitat-related differences in these crabs' feeding rates on a common prey (soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria). Second, measuring their influence on invertebrate communities associated with mussel clumps. The results show that mussel clumps hold higher invertebrate density and diversity than surrounding sedimentary bottoms. In the laboratory, the feeding rates of native mud crabs were dependent on the type of habitat (sand flat > mussel clump), whereas those of green crabs were significantly higher and unrelated to the habitat in which predation occurred. In field experiments, juvenile green crabs were also the only predators that changed community structure in the mussel clump habitat. These results indicate that green crabs can cause a significant impact on native species and communities. Moreover, they suggest that the ability of this species to overcome the refuge provided by complex biogenic habitats for prey may represent an unexplored mechanism to explain this invader's expansion here and elsewhere.

Familiarity with teammate's attitudes improves team performance in virtual reality	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPEED-ACCURACY TRADEOFF; MEMORY; CONSEQUENCES; BEHAVIOR	Virtual reality (VR) is a potentially challenging social environment for effective communication and collaboration. Thus, we conducted a VR study to determine whether increased familiarity with a teammate would improve performance on a joint decision making task. Specifically, because attitude familiarity, or knowledge of another person's attitudes, has been correlated with better relationship functioning in the past, we anticipated that team performance would improve when teammates were first asked to discuss their task-relevant attitudes with one another. We also hypothesized that increased familiarity would be particularly useful in immersive VR, where typical social and other nonverbal cues were lacking. Twenty pairs recruited from a workplace environment were randomly assigned to either the Familiar or Control condition before completing a joint decision making task both in VR and on desktop monitors. The manipulation of attitude familiarity was successful: pairs in the Familiar condition were significantly more aware of their partners' unique task-relevant attitudes. Results found that in VR, Familiar pairs were more accurate at determining patterns to events. Additionally, for teams less experienced in VR, Familiar pairs were also more accurate at predicting future events. However, there was no meaningful statistical difference in pairs' ability to identify information. Familiar teams also took more time to answer questions, and we found no difference in self-reported communication quality. Overall, this was the first successful manipulation of attitude familiarity and results indicate that such an intervention may prove useful in a collaborative work environment, as Familiar teams demonstrated greater accuracy, especially in VR.

Making inferences about using others' perspective in referential communication	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPEAKERS PERSPECTIVE; MIND	Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand others' mental states, and that these mental states can differ from our own. Although healthy adults have little trouble passing conceptual tests of ToM (e.g., the false belief task [1]), they do not always succeed in using ToM [2,3]. In order to be successful in referential communication, listeners need to correctly infer the way in which a speaker's perspective constrains reference and inhibit their own perspective accordingly. However, listeners may require prompts to take these effortful inferential steps. The current study investigated the possibility of embedding prompts in the instructions for listeners to make inference about using a speaker's perspective. Experiment 1 showed that provision of a clear introductory example of the full chain of inferences resulted in large improvement in performance. Residual egocentric errors suggested that the improvement was not simply due to superior comprehension of the instructions. Experiment 2 further dissociated the effect by placing selective emphasis on making inference about inhibiting listeners' own perspective versus using the speaker's perspective. Results showed that only the latter had a significant effect on successful performance. The current findings clearly demonstrated that listeners do not readily make inferences about using speakers' perspectives, but can do so when prompted.	[Wang, J.

Disease risk analysis (DRA) tools are designed to provide objective, repeatable and documented assessment of the disease risks for a population and measures to reduce these risks through management options. To the best of our knowledge, DRAs have not previously been published for sea turtles, although disease is reported to contribute to sea turtle population decline. Here, a comprehensive list of health hazards is provided for all seven species of sea turtles. The possible risk these hazards pose to the health of sea turtles were assessed and "One Health" aspects of interacting with sea turtles were also investigated. The risk assessment was undertaken in collaboration with more than 30 experts in the field including veterinarians, microbiologists, social scientists, epidemiologists and stakeholders, in the form of two international workshops and one local workshop. The general finding of the DRA was the distinct lack of knowledge regarding a link between the presence of pathogens and diseases manifestation in sea turtles. A higher rate of disease in immunocompromised individuals was repeatedly reported and a possible link between immunosuppression and environmental contaminants as a result of anthropogenic influences was suggested. Society based conservation initiatives and as a result the cultural and social aspect of interacting with sea turtles appeared to need more attention and research. A risk management workshop was carried out to acquire the insights of local policy makers about management options for the risks relevant to Queensland and the options were evaluated considering their feasibility and effectiveness. The sea turtle DRA presented here, is a structured guide for future risk assessments to be used in specific scenarios such as translocation and head-starting programs.

J	Xue, XL; Zhou, DS; Zhou, CJ				Xue, Xianglian; Zhou, Dongsheng; Zhou, Changjun			New insights into the existing image encryption algorithms based on DNA coding	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEQUENCE OPERATION; CHAOS THEORY; CRYPTANALYSIS; PERMUTATION; SYSTEM; SECURE	Because a DNA nucleotide sequence has the characteristics of large storage capacity, high parallelism, and low energy consumption, DNA cryptography is favored by information security researchers. Image encryption algorithms based on DNA coding have become a research hotspot in the field of image encryption and security. In this study, based on a comprehensive review of the existing studies and their results, we present new insights into the existing image encryption algorithms based on DNA coding. First, the existing algorithms were summarized and classified into five types, depending on the type of DNA coding: DNA fixed coding, DNA dynamic coding, different types of base complement operation, different DNA sequence algebraic operations, and combinations of multiple DNA operations. Second, we analyzed and studied each classification algorithm using simulation and obtained their advantages and disadvantages. Third, the DNA coding mechanisms, DNA algebraic operations, and DNA algebraic combination operations were compared and discussed. Then, a new scheme was proposed by combining the optimal coding mechanism with the optimal DNA coding operation. Finally, we revealed the shortcomings of the existing studies and the future direction for improving image encryption methods based on DNA coding.

J	Gutierrez, M; Smith, R				Gutierrez, Mathew; Smith, Rob			XFlow: An algorithm for extracting ion chromatograms	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE	Mass spectrometry is a fundamental tool for modern proteomics. The increasing availability of mass spectrometry data paired with the increasing sensitivity and fidelity of the instruments necessitates new and more potent analytical methods. To that end, we have created and present XFlow, a feature detection algorithm for extracting ion chromatograms from MS1 LC-MS data. XFlow is a parameter-free procedurally agnostic feature detection algorithm that utilizes the latent properties of ion chromatograms to resolve them from the surrounding noise present in MS1 data. XFlow is designed to function on either profile or centroided data across different resolutions and instruments. This broad applicability lends XFlow strong utility as a one-size-fits-all method for MS1 analysis or target acquisition for MS2. XFlow is written in Java and packaged with JS-MS, an open-source mass spectrometry analysis toolkit.

To give insights on patient management within Fangcang hospitals, we conducted a retrospective analysis to: 1) describe the characteristics of the patients admitted to Fangcang hospitals and 2) explore risk factors for longer length of stay (LOS). We enrolled 136 confirmed COVID-19 patients, including asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms, who were hospitalized in the Wuti Fangcang Hospital. 58 patients completed the treatment and discharged before 1 March 2020. After describing patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, exposure history, treatment received and time course of the disease, we conducted linear regression analysis to identify factors influencing LOS. We found that patients having fever before admission were hospitalized 3.5 days (95%CI 1.39 to 5.63, p = 0.002) longer than those without fever and that patients having bilateral pneumonia were hospitalized 3.4 days (95%CI 0.49 to 6.25, p = 0.023) longer than those with normal CT scan results. We also found weak evidence suggesting that patients with diabetes were hospitalized 3.2 days longer than those without diabetes (95%CI -0.2 to 6.56, p = 0.065). However, we observed no significant differences in LOS between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and between patients who received treatment and those without treatment. Longer duration of hospitalization among non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with having fever, bilateral pneumonia on CT scan and diabetes. However, being asymptomatic and using supportive medications at the early stage of infection do not have significant influences on LOS. Our study is a single-centered study with relatively small sample size. The findings provide evidence for predicting hospital bed demand in a novel response scenario and may help decision-makers in preparing for ramping up the health system capacity.

J	Brooks, MB; Mitnick, CD; Manjourides, J				Brooks, Meredith B.; Mitnick, Carole D.; Manjourides, Justin			Comparison of censoring assumptions to reduce bias in tuberculosis treatment cohort analyses	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; INVERSE PROBABILITY; RECURRENCE; SURVIVAL	Objective Observational tuberculosis cohort studies are often limited by a lack of long-term data characterizing survival beyond the initial treatment outcome. Though Cox proportional hazards models are often applied to these data, differential risk of long-term survival, dependent on the initial treatment outcome, can lead to violations of model assumptions. We evaluate the performance of two alternate censoring approaches on reducing bias in treatment effect estimates. Design We simulate a typical multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cohort study and use Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship of an aggressive treatment regimen with hazard of death. We compare three assumptions regarding censored observations to determine which produces least biased treatment effect estimates: conventional non-informative censoring, an extension of short-term survival informed by literature, and incorporation of predicted long-term vital status. Results The treatment regimen's protective effect on death is consistently underestimated by the conventional censoring method, up to 7.6%. Models using the two alternative censoring techniques produce treatment effect estimates consistently stronger and less biased than the conventional method, underestimating the treatment effect by less than 2.4% across all scenarios. Conclusions When model assumptions are violated, alternative censoring techniques can more accurately estimate associations between treatment and long-term survival. In multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cohort analyses, this bias reduction may yield more accurate and, larger effect estimates. This bias reduction can be achieved through use of standard statistical procedures with a simple re-coding of the censoring indicator.

COVID-19 observations and accompanying dataset of non-pharmaceutical interventions across US universities, March 2020	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OUTBREAKS	Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) guidance for specific institutional audiences to limit community spread. Audiences include: business, clinical, public health, education, community, and state/local government. The swift, severe, and global nature of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to systematically obtain a national view of how larger institutions of higher education adopted NPI guidance at the onset of the pandemic. Method An original database of COVID-19-related university NPI policy changes was compiled. Survey team members manually combed university websites and official statements capturing implementation decisions and dates for five NPI variables from 575 U.S. universities, across 50 states and the District of Columbia, during March of 2020. The universities included in this study were selected from the Department of Education Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which provides a set of university explanatory variables. Using IPEDS as the basis for the organizational data allows consistent mapping to event-time and institutional characteristic variables including public health announcements, geospatial, census, and political affiliation. Results The dataset enables event-time analysis and offers a variety of variables to support institutional level study and identification of underlying biases like educational attainment. A descriptive analysis of the dataset reveals that there was substantial heterogeneity in the decisions that were made and the timing of these decisions as they temporally related to key state, national, and global emergency announcements. The WHO pandemic declaration coincided with the largest number of university decisions to implement NPIs. Conclusion This study provides descriptive observations and produced an original dataset that will be useful for future research focused on drivers and trends of COVID-19 NPIs for U.S. Universities. This preliminary analysis suggests COVID-19 university decisions appeared to be made largely at the university level, leading to major variations in the nature and timing of the responses both between and within states, which requires further study.

We investigated the impact of state level viral suppression among PWH in the United States on estimated HIV incidence between 2010 and 2015. Methods Viral suppression data and HIV incidence estimates from the National HIV Surveillance System were available from 29 states and the District of Columbia. We assumed a one year delay for viral suppression to impact incidence. Poisson regression models were used to calculate the estimated annual percent change (EAPC) in incidence rate. We employed a multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression model to assess the effects of state level race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, percent men who have sex with men (MSM) and hepatitis C virus prevalence as a proxy for injection drug use on HIV incidence. Findings Fitted HIV incidence for 30 jurisdictions declined from 11.5 in 2010 to 10.0 per 100,000 population by 2015 corresponding with an EAPC of -2.67 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] -2.95, -2.38). Southern states experienced the highest estimated incidence by far throughout this period but upon adjustment for viral suppression and demographics there was a 36% lower incidence rate than Northeast states (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 0.64; 95%CI 0.42, 0.99). For every 10 percentage point (pp) increase in viral suppression there was an adjusted 4% decline in HIV incidence rate in the subsequent year (aRR 0.96; 95%CI 0.93, 0.99). While controlling for viral suppression, HIV incidence rate increased by 42% (aRR 1.42 95%CI 1.31, 1.54) for every 5 pp increase in percent Black race and by 27% (aRR 1.27 95%CI 1.10, 1.48) for every 1 pp increase in percent MSM in states. Interpretation A decline in estimated HIV incidence from 2010 to 2015 was associated with increasing viral suppression in the United States.

Microsatellite markers are an efficient tool for assessing the genetic diversity of germplasm collections, optimizing their use in breeding programs. This study genetically characterizes a large collection of 410 grapevine accessions maintained at the Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) (Brazil). The accessions were genotyped with 17 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. Genetic data were analyzed to determine the genetic structure of the germplasm, quantify its allelic diversity, suggest the composition of a core collection, and discover cases of synonymy, duplication, and misnaming. A total of 304 alleles were obtained, and 334 unique genotypes were identified. The molecular profiles of 145 accessions were confirmed according to the literature and databases, and the molecular profiles of more than 100 genotypes were reported for the first time. The analysis of the genetic structure revealed different levels of stratification. The primary division was between accessions related toVitis viniferaandV.labrusca, followed by their separation from wild grapevine. A core collection of 120 genotypes captured 100% of all detected alleles. The accessions selected for the core collection may be used in future phenotyping efforts, in genome association studies, and for conservation purposes. Genetic divergence among accessions has practical applications in grape breeding programs, as the choice of relatively divergent parents will maximize the frequency of progeny with superior characteristics. Together, our results can enhance the management of grapevine germplasm and guide the efficient exploitation of genetic diversity to facilitate the development of new grape cultivars for fresh fruits, wine, and rootstock.

Many studies have revealed that the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor agonist is a potent activator of brown adipocytes, even in humans, and PKA and p38 MAPK have been demonstrated for regulating the transcription of a wide range of critical genes such as Ucp1. We previously revealed that the PKA-ASK1-p38 axis is activated in immature brown adipocytes and contributes to functional maturation. However, the downstream mechanisms of PKA that initiate the p38 MAPK cascade are still mostly unknown in mature brown adipocytes. Here, we identified the ASK family as a crucial signaling molecule bridging PKA and MAPK in mature brown adipocytes. Mechanistically, the phosphorylation of ASK1 at threonine 99 and serine 993 is critical in PKA-dependent ASK1 activation. Additionally, PKA also activates ASK2, which contributes to MAPK regulation. These lines of evidence provide new details for tailoring a beta AR-dependent brown adipocyte activation strategy.

J	Berens, S; Funke, J				Berens, Sabrina; Funke, Joachim			A vignette study of option refusal and decision deferral as two forms of decision avoidance: Situational and personal predictors	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHOICE-PROCESS; TIME PRESSURE; MAKING STYLES; PROCRASTINATION; CONFLICT; SCALE; NEED; INDECISIVENESS; PREFERENCE; DYNAMICS	The avoidance of a decision is a phenomenon that has been studied in various forms and psychological disciplines. Nevertheless, previous studies often lacked the integration of situational as well as personal factors in predicting decision avoidance. Additionally, studies about conditions that affect different forms of decision avoidance are still lacking. Therefore, this study investigated how situational and personal factors influenced two different forms of decision avoidance: 1) the option of deferring choice to a later point in time (decision deferral) and 2) the option to refuse both alternatives (option refusal). Furthermore, this study aimed to analyze how the participants experienced their avoidance behavior. This served the purpose of capturing functional and dysfunctional avoidance out of a subjective perspective instead of providing predefined best options. A vignette study based on realistic decision-making scenarios within a student's daily life was conducted. In an online survey, N = 312 participants chose to decide, to defer choice, or to refuse options in the context of eight vignettes. Situational factors (time pressure, lack of information, and attractiveness of alternatives) were systematically varied. Additionally, the following personal factors were captured by questionnaires: indecisiveness, decision-making styles, and the need for cognitive closure. Further factors were captured, but not systematically varied: selection difficulty, importance of a decision, and similarity of alternatives. The individual satisfaction with decision-making behavior was evaluated as an indicator of subjective decision quality. The results showed that decision deferral was affected by situational factors (primarily due to time pressure), selection difficulty, and individual indecisiveness. The refusal of current alternatives was exclusively influenced by situational factors, mainly the manipulated attractiveness of the choice-set. The results emphasize the functionality of refusing unattractive options and help to distinguish adaptive and maladaptive coping forms in decision-making.

Onion bulb extract can both reverse and prevent colitis in mice via inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules and neutrophil activity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BOWEL-DISEASE; ULCERATIVE-COLITIS; CROHNS-DISEASE; PATHOGENESIS; CYTOKINES; SAFETY; RISK; CONSUMPTION; TARGET; RATS	Background Onion is one of the most commonly used plants in the traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases. We recently demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of onion bulb extract (OBE) in reducing colitis severity in mice when administered at the same time of colitis induction. However, whether onion can reverse established colitis or even prevent its development has not been investigated. Hypothesis To test 1. whether OBE can reduce colitis severity when given either before (preventative approach) or after (treatment approach) colitis induction and if so, 2. what are the mechanisms by which onion can achieve these effects. Methods Colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration using treatment and preventative approaches. The severity of the inflammation was determined by the gross and histological assessments. The colonic level/activity of pro-inflammatory molecules and immune cell markers was assessed by immunofluorescence and western blotting analysis. In vitro neutrophil superoxide release and survival was assessed by chemilumenecense and Annexin-V/7AAD assays respectively. Results OBE treatment significantly reduced colitis severity in both approaches, the colonic expression/activity profile of pro-inflammatory molecules, inhibited WKYMVm-induced superoxide release, and increased spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils in vitro. Conclusions OBE can be used as an effective option in the prevention and/or the treatment of established colitis.

J	Means, SA; Blasche, C; Laing, CR				Means, Shawn A.; Blasche, Christian; Laing, Carlo R.			A permutation method for network assembly	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RANDOM GRAPHS; SYSTEM; WEB	We present a method for assembling directed networks given a prescribed bi-degree (in- and out-degree) sequence. This method utilises permutations of initial adjacency matrix assemblies that conform to the prescribed in-degree sequence, yet violate the given out-degree sequence. It combines directed edge-swapping and constrained Monte-Carlo edge-mixing for improving approximations to the given out-degree sequence until it is exactly matched. Our method permits inclusion or exclusion of 'multi-edges', allowing assembly of weighted or binary networks. It further allows prescribing the overall percentage of such multiple connections-permitting exploration of a weighted synthetic network space unlike any other method currently available for comparison of real-world networks with controlled multi-edge proportion null spaces. The graph space is sampled by the method non-uniformly, yet the algorithm provides weightings for the sample space across all possible realisations allowing computation of statistical averages of network metrics as if they were sampled uniformly. Given a sequence of in- and out- degrees, the method can also produce simple graphs for sequences that satisfy conditions of graphicality. Our method successfully builds networks with order O(10(7)) edges on the scale of minutes with a laptop running Matlab. We provide our implementation of the method on the GitHub repository for immediate use by the research community, and demonstrate its application to three real-world networks for null-space comparisons as well as the study of dynamics of neuronal networks.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of ED encounters in a university hospital between October 2013 and September 2018 who met the following inclusion criteria: Suspected UTI with simultaneous collection of paired urinary cultures and blood cultures (PUB) and determination of Procalcitonin (PCT). We sought to develop a simple algorithm based on clinical signs and PCT for the management of suspected UTI. Individual patient presentations were retrospectively evaluated by a clinical "triple F" algorithm (F1 ="fever", F2 ="failure", F3 ="focus") supported by PCT and PUB. We identified 183 ED patients meeting the inclusion criteria. We introduced the term UTI with systemic involvement (SUTI) with three degrees of diagnostic certainty: bacteremic UTI (24.0%; 44/183), probable SUTI (14.2%; 26/183) and possible SUTI (27.9%; 51/183). In bacteremic UTI, half of patients (54.5%; 24/44) presented without genitourinary symptoms. Discordant bacteraemia was diagnosed in 16 patients (24.6% of all bacteremic patients). An alternative focus was identified in 67 patients, five patients presented withS.aureusbacteremia. 62 patients were diagnosed with possible UTI (n = 20) or ABU (n = 42). Using the proposed "triple F" algorithm, dichotomised PCT of < 0.25 pg/ml had a negative predictive value of 88.7% and 96.2% for bacteraemia und accordant bacteraemia respectively. The application of the algorithm to our cohort could have resulted in 33.3% reduction of BCs. Using the diagnostic categories "possible" or "probable" SUTI as a trigger for initiation of antimicrobial treatment would have reduced or streamlined antimicrobial use in 30.6% and 58.5% of cases, respectively. In conclusion, the "3F" algorithm supported by PCT and PUB is a promising diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship tool.

Public perceptions of conflicting information surrounding COVID-19: Results from a nationally representative survey of US adults	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEALTH INFORMATION; EXPOSURE	Conflicting information surrounding COVID-19 abounds, from disagreement over the effectiveness of face masks in preventing viral transmission to competing claims about the promise of certain treatments. Despite the potential for conflicting information about COVID-19 to produce adverse public health effects, little is known about whether the U.S. public notices this information, and whether certain population subgroups are particularly likely to do so. To address these questions, we fielded a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults in late April 2020 (N= 1,007). Results showed substantial self-reported exposure to conflicting information about COVID-19, with nearly 75% of participants reporting having recently heard such information from health experts, politicians, and/or others. Participants perceived disagreement across a range of COVID-19-related issues, though from politicians more than health experts. Factors including political affiliation, information source use, and personal experience with COVID-19 were associated with perceptions of disagreement. Future research should consider potential cognitive and behavioral consequences of such perceptions.

The disappearance of wetland ecosystems due to coastal development prevents birds from completing their migrations, resulting in population declines, and even an eventual collapse of the migration phenomenon. Coastal wetlands are also under threat from global climate change and its consequences, notably sea level rise (SLR), extreme storm events, and accompanying wave and tidal surges. The impacts of SLR are compounded by coastal subsidence and decreasing sedimentation, which can result from coastal development. Thus, important wetlands along the flyway should be assessed for the impacts of climate change and coastal subsidence to plan and implement proactive climate adaptation strategies that include habitat migration and possibility of coastal squeeze. We modelled the impacts of climate change and decreasing sedimentation rates on important bird habitats in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar site to support a climate adaptation strategy that will continue to host migratory birds. Located in the Inner Deep Bay of the Pearl River estuary, Mai Po's tidal flats, coastal mangroves, marshes, and fishponds provide habitat for over 80,000 wintering and passage waterbirds. We applied the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to simulate habitat conversion under two SLR scenarios (1.5m and 2.0m) for 2050, 2075, and 2100 for four accretion rates (2mm/yr, 4 mm/yr, 8 mm/yr, 15 mm/yr). The results showed no discernible impact to habitats until after 2075, but projections for 2100 show that the mangroves, marshes and tidal flats could be impacted in almost all scenarios of SLR and accretion. Under a 1.5m SLR scenario, even at low tide, if accretion levels decrease to 4 mm/yr, the tidal flats will be inundated and with a 2 mm/yr accretion the mangroves will also be inundated. Thus, important shorebird habitats will be lost. During high tide the ponds inside the nature reserve, which are intensively managed to provide high tide roosting sites and other habitats for waterbirds, will also be inundated. Thus, with a 1.5m SLR and declining sedimentation the migratory shorebirds will lose habitat, including the high tide roosting habitats inside the nature reserve. The model also indicates that the fishponds further inland in the Ramsar site will be less impacted. Most fishponds are privately owned and could be developed in the future, including into high rise apartments; thus, securing them for conservation should be an important climate change adaptation strategy for Mai Po, since they provide essential habitats for birds under future climate change scenarios. But Mai Po is only one steppingstone along the EAAF, and hundreds of other wetlands are also threatened by encroaching infrastructure and climate change. Thus, similar analyses for the other wetlands are recommended to develop a flyway-wide climate-adaptation conservation strategy before available options become lost to wetland conversion.

J	Glenister, C; Burns, E; Rowe, R				Glenister, Ceri; Burns, Ethel; Rowe, Rachel			Local guidelines for admission to UK midwifery units compared with national guidance: A national survey using the UK Midwifery Study System (UKMidSS)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							JEHOVAH-WITNESSES; RISK; BIRTH; WOMEN; OUTCOMES; PERSPECTIVES; PLACE	Objectives To describe the extent to which local guidelines for admission to UK midwifery units align with national guidance; to describe variation in individual admission criteria; and to describe the extent to which alongside midwifery units (AMUs) are the default option for eligible women. Design National cross-sectional survey. Setting All 122 UK maternity services with midwifery units, between October 2018 and February 2019. Outcome measures Alignment of local admission guidelines with national guidance (NICE CG190); frequency and nature of variation in individual admission criteria; percentage of services with AMU as default birth setting for eligible women. Results Admission guidelines were received from 87 maternity services (71%), representing 153 units, and we analysed 85 individual guideline documents. Overall, 92% of local admission guidelines varied from national guidance; 76% contained both some admission criteria that were 'more inclusive' and some that were 'more restrictive' than national guidance. The most common 'more inclusive' admission criteria, occurring in 40-80% of guidelines, were: explicit admission of women with parity >= 4; aged 35-40yrs; with a BMI 30-35kg/m(2); selective admission of women with a BMI 35-40kg/m(2); Group B Streptococcus carriers; and those undergoing induction of labour. The most common 'more restrictive' admission criteria, occurring in around 30% of guidelines, excluded women who: declined blood products; had experienced female genital cutting; were aged <16yrs; or had not attended for regular antenatal care. Over half of services (59%) reported the AMU as the default option for healthy women with straightforward pregnancies. Conclusions The variation in local midwifery unit admission criteria found in this study represents a potentially confusing and inequitable basis for women making choices about planned place of birth. A review of national guidance may be indicated and where a lack of relevant evidence underlies variation in admission criteria, further research by planned place of birth is required.

Part of this association can be explained by socio-economic factors, which are most commonly accounted for. Our aim was to explore the potential contribution of other factors related to clinical burden, social interaction and functioning. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on wave 6 of the population-based Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), among participants aged 50+ (n = 67 179). The Control, Autonomy, Self-Realization and Pleasure (CASP-12v1) questionnaire measured QoL. The association between number of diseases and QoL was tested in a mixed-effects linear regression model. The base model controlled for socio-economic characteristics. Factors of interest (symptoms, polypharmacy, unmet care needs, utilisation of care, social network, personal and financial help, loneliness and activities of daily living (ADL) with instrumental activities (IADL)) were added to the base model one at a time and tested for relevance (i.e. change in the beta-coefficient of the number of conditions of 15% or more). Results Symptoms, polypharmacy, loneliness and ADL/IADL appeared relevant and were retained in the final model. The association between number of conditions and QoL in the base model was -2.44 [95% CI: -2.72; -2.16], while this association was -0.76 [95%CI: -0.97; -0.54] after all relevant factors were included. Conclusion Factors beyond the socio-economic circumstances play an important role in explaining the association between number of conditions and QoL. These factors should be considered to better estimate the impact of chronic diseases on QoL, and for improving patient care.

Evaluation of viral co-infections among patients with community-associatedClostridioides difficileinfection	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CLOSTRIDIUM-DIFFICILE; ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS; MULTICENTER; NOROVIRUS; ETIOLOGY; PANEL	We assessed viral co-infections in 155 patients with community-associatedClostridioides difficileinfection in five U.S. sites during December 2012-February 2013. Eighteen patients (12%) tested positive for norovirus (n = 10), adenovirus (n = 4), rotavirus (n = 3), or sapovirus (n = 1). Co-infected patients were more likely than non-co-infected patients to have nausea or vomiting (56% vs 31%; p = 0.04), suggesting that viral co-pathogens contributed to symptoms in some patients. There were no significant differences in prior healthcare or medication exposures or in CDI complications.

Medical management of muscle weakness in Duchenne muscular dystrophy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS; LIFE	Introduction Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a childhood onset muscular dystrophy leading to shortened life expectancy. There are gaps in published DMD care guidelines regarding recently approved DMD medications and alternative steroid dosing regimens. Methods A list of statements about use of currently available therapies for DMD in the United States was developed based on a systematic literature review and expert panel feedback. Panelists' responses were collected using a modified Delphi approach. Results Among corticosteroid regimens, either deflazacort or prednisone weekend dosing was preferred when payer requirements do not dictate choice. Most patients with exon 51 skip-amenable mutations should be offered eteplirsen, before or with a corticosteroid. Discussion The options available for medical management of the motor symptoms of DMD are expanding rapidly. The choice of medical therapies should balance expected benefit with side effects.

We conducted a cross-sectional study between January and December 2018, on indigenous women living nearby an urban center of the Midwest region of Brazil and determined the prevalence of TV. Factors associated with TV infection and a comparison of molecular and direct microscopy diagnoses were determined. 241 indigenous women aged above 18 years participated in the study. Cervical and vaginal brush samples were collected to diagnose TV through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Direct microscopy for detection of TV, and cellular changes was performed. A sociodemographic and behavioral questionnaire was applied at the beginning of the study. All the data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The result obtained showed that 27.8% [95% CI: 22.2-33.9] were positive for TV on PCR, while 7.41% [95% CI: 4.1-11] showed positive on direct microscopy. Direct microcopy also found 21 (8.71%) and 8 (3.31%) women infected with Gardnerella vaginalisand Candida albicans, respectively. In addition, 10 women presented atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and 14 lesions suggestive of HPV. Single women, under the age of 30 and who do not use condoms, were found to have a greater chance of getting TV infection. The high prevalence TV found in this population is comparable to highly vulnerable populations, as prisoners, sex workers and women in regions with low socioeconomic levels, moreover, seems to be an underdiagnosis of this infection. Therefore, a routine test program, as well as a review of the diagnostic method used, is encouraged for proper management.

Stigma toward small babies and their mothers in Ghana: A study of the experiences of postpartum women living with HIV	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; CARE; PRETERM; PHENOMENOLOGY; PERCEPTIONS; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY; INFECTION; CHILDREN; OUTCOMES	Infants born to HIV-infected mothers are more likely to be low birthweight (LBW) than other infants, a condition that is stigmatized in many settings worldwide, including sub-Saharan Africa. Few studies have characterized the social-cultural context and response to LBW stigma among mothers in sub-Saharan Africa or explored the views of women living with HIV (WLHIV) on the causes of LBW. We purposively sampled thirty postpartum WLHIV, who had given birth to either LBW or normal birthweight infants, from two tertiary hospitals in Accra, Ghana. Using semi-structured interviews, we explored women's understanding of the etiology of LBW, and their experiences of caring for a LBW infant. Interviews were analyzed using interpretive phenomenology. Mothers assessed their babies' smallness based on the baby's size, not hospital-recorded birthweight. Several participants explained that severe depression and a loss of appetite, linked to stigma following an HIV diagnosis during pregnancy, contributed to infants being born LBW. Women with small babies also experienced stigma due to the newborns' "undesirable" physical features and other people's unfamiliarity with their size. Consequently, mothers experienced blame, reluctance showing the baby to others, and social gossip. As a result of this stigma, women reported self-isolation and depressive symptoms. These experiences were layered on the burden of healthcare and infant feeding costs for LBW infants. LBW stigma appeared to attenuate with increased infant weight gain. A few of the women also did not breastfeed because they thought their baby's small size indicated pediatric HIV infection. Among WLHIV in urban areas in Ghana, mother and LBW infants may experience LBW-related stigma. A multi-component intervention that includes reducing LBW incidence, treating antenatal depression, providing psychosocial support after a LBW birth, and increasing LBW infants' weight gain are critically needed.

This article presents the results of the survey and compares the indicators used in the survey and those in the annual statistical report released by the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA). The number of corneal transplantations completed by the 64 hospitals from 2014 to 2018 was respectively 5377, 6394, 7595, 8270 and 8980, totally 36,616 (22,959 male and 13,657 female). The five largest hospitals by the number of corneal transplantations completed 15,994 surgeries in total, accounting for 43.68% of all the surgeries performed in the 64 hospitals. The most common indication for corneal transplantations was corneal leukoma (7683, 20.98%), followed by bacterial keratitis (4209, 11.49%), corneal dystrophies (4189, 11.44%), keratoconus (3578, 9.77%) and corneal perforation (2839, 7.75%). The main surgical techniques were penetrating keratoplasty (PK) (19,896, 54.34%), anterior lamellar keratoplasty (ALK) (13,869, 37.88%). The proportion of PK decreased from 57.97% in 2014 to 52.88% in 2018 while the proportion of ALK increased from 36.04% in 2014 to 37.92% in 2018. The geographical distribution of keratoplasties performed in China is unbalanced. PK and ALK were the main techniques of CT and corneal leukoma, bacterial keratitis and corneal dystrophies were the main indications for CT in China.

Three types of vegetables were selected: vegetable soybean, mung bean sprouts, and white radish sprouts. These selected vegetables were fixed on a three-dimensional rotary gravity controller, rotated slowly. The selected vegetables were stored at 25 degrees C and 66% of relative humidity for 9, 6, or 5 d while undergoing this process. The simulated microgravity was controlled utilizing a gravity controller around 0 m s(-2). The mung bean sprouts stored for 6 d under simulated microgravity conditions maintained higher thickness levels than the vegetable samples stored under normal gravity conditions (9.8 m s(-2)) for the same duration. The mass of all three items decreased with time without regard to the gravity environment, though the samples stored within the simulated microgravity environment displayed significant mass retention on and after 3 d for mung bean sprout samples and 1 d for white radish sprout samples. In contrast, the mass retention effect was not observed in the vegetable soybean samples. Hence, it was confirmed that the mass retention effect of microgravity was limited to sprout vegetables. As a result of analysis harnessing a mathematical model, assuming that the majority of the mass loss is due to moisture loss, a significant difference in mass reduction coefficient occurs among mung bean sprouts and white radish sprouts due to the microgravity environment, and the mass retention effect of simulated microgravity is quantitatively evaluated utilizing mathematical models. Simulated microgravity, which varies significantly from conventional refrigeration, ethylene control, and modified atmosphere, was demonstrated effective as a novel method for preserving and maintaining the freshness of sprout vegetables. This founding will support long-term space flight missions by prolonging shelf life of sprout vegetables.

In particular, a healthcare-associated outbreak could become the epicenter of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different intervention strategies on the hospital outbreak within a tertiary hospital. A mathematical model was developed for the COVID-19 transmission within a 2500-bed tertiary hospital of South Korea. The SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model with a compartment of doctor, nurse, patient, and caregiver was constructed. The effects of different intervention strategies such as front door screening, quarantine unit for newly admitted patients, early testing of suspected infected people, and personal protective equipment for both medical staff and visitors were evaluated. The model suggested that the early testing (within eight hours) of infected cases and monitoring the quarantine ward for newly hospitalized patients are effective measures for decreasing the incidence of COVID-19 within a hospital (81.3% and 70% decrease of number of incident cases, respectively, during 60 days). Front door screening for detecting suspected cases had only 42% effectiveness. Screening for prohibiting the admission of COVID-19 patients was more effective than the measures for patients before emergency room or outpatient clinic. This model suggests that under the assumed conditions, some effective measures have a great influence on the incidence of COVID-19 within a hospital. The implementation of the preventive measures could reduce the size of a hospital outbreak.

A novel computational approach for predicting complex phenotypes in Drosophila (starvation-sensitive and sterile) by deriving their gene expression signatures from public data	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Many research teams perform numerous genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and other types of omic experiments to understand molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of disease and health. Often (but not always), the results of these experiments are deposited in publicly available repository databases. These data records often include phenotypic characteristics following genetic and environmental perturbations, with the aim of discovering underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the phenotypic responses. A constrained set of phenotypic characteristics is usually recorded and these are mostly hypothesis driven of possible to record within financial or practical constraints. We present a novel proof-of-principal computational approach for combining publicly available gene-expression data from control/mutant animal experiments that exhibit a particular phenotype, and we use this approach to predict unobserved phenotypic characteristics in new experiments (data derived from EBI's ArrayExpress and ExpressionAtlas respectively). We utilised available microarray gene-expression data for two phenotypes (starvation-sensitive and sterile) in Drosophila. The data were combined using a linear-mixed effects model with the inclusion of consecutive principal components to account for variability between experiments in conjunction with Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. We present how available data can be ranked in accordance to a phenotypic likelihood of exhibiting these two phenotypes using random forest. The results from our study show that it is possible to integrate seemingly different gene-expression microarray data and predict a potential phenotypic manifestation with a relatively high degree of confidence (>80% AUC). This provides thus far unexplored opportunities for inferring unknown and unbiased phenotypic characteristics from already performed experiments, in order to identify studies for future analyses. Molecular mechanisms associated with gene and environment perturbations are intrinsically linked and give rise to a variety of phenotypic manifestations. Therefore, unravelling the phenotypic spectrum can help to gain insights into disease mechanisms associated with gene and environmental perturbations.

This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the world's most affected countries, and its health system was already experiencing the aftermath of the 2015 recession. Methods Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (Sao Paulo) and impoverished (Maranhao) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings. Results We found the concept of 'health sector crisis' to be politically charged among healthcare providers in Sao Paulo and Maranhao. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexible-if insecure-working arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies have streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but were also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranhao. Conclusions The 'plates' of a health system may shift and adjust in unexpected ways in response to recessions, and some of these changes might outlast the crisis. As low-income countries enter post-COVID economic recessions, it will be important to monitor the adjustments taking place in health systems, to ensure that past gains in access to care and job security are not eroded.

In this study, we have assessed the impact of idealism and relativism using the Ethics Position Theory. We have tested its capacity to predict moral identity, moral judgement of social vs. environmental issues, and self-reported pro-environmental behaviours. The results from an online MTurk study of 432 US participants revealed that idealism had a significant impact on all the tested variables, but the case was different with relativism. Consistently with the findings of previous studies, we found relativism to be a strong predictor of moral identity and moral judgement of social issues. In contrast, relativism only weakly interacted with making moral judgements of environmental issues, and had no effects in predicting pro-environmental behaviours. These findings suggest that Ethics Position Theory could have a strong potential for defining moral differences between environmental attitudes and behaviours, capturing the moral drivers of an attitude-behaviour gap, which continuously stands as a barrier in motivating people to become more pro-environmental.

H.; Ramsay, Tim; Dowlatshahi, Dar; Fahed, Robert; Dyason, Claire; Shamy, Michel			Physician preparedness for resource allocation decisions under pandemic conditions: A cross-sectional survey of Canadian physicians, April 2020	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background Under the pandemic conditions created by the novel coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19), physicians have faced difficult choices allocating scarce resources, including but not limited to critical care beds and ventilators. Past experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and current reports suggest that making these decisions carries a heavy emotional toll for physicians around the world. We sought to explore Canadian physicians' preparedness and attitudes regarding resource allocation decisions. Methods From April 3 to April 13, 2020, we conducted an 8-question online survey of physicians practicing in the region of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, organized around 4 themes: physician preparedness for resource rationing, physician preparedness to offer palliative care, attitudes towards resource allocation policy, and approaches to resource allocation decision-making. Results We collected 219 responses, of which 165 were used for analysis. The majority (78%) of respondents felt "somewhat" or "a little prepared" to make resource allocation decisions, and 13% felt "not at all prepared." A majority of respondents (63%) expected the provision of palliative care to be "very" or "somewhat difficult." Most respondents (83%) either strongly or somewhat agreed that there should be policy to guide resource allocation. Physicians overwhelmingly agreed on certain factors that would be important in resource allocation, including whether patients were likely to survive, and whether they had dementia and other significant comorbidities. Respondents generally did not feel confident that they would have the social support they needed at the time of making resource allocation decisions. Interpretation This rapidly implemented survey suggests that a sample of Canadian physicians feel underprepared to make resource allocation decisions, and desire both more emotional support and clear, transparent, evidence-based policy.

Doug			Intravaginal poly-(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-(polyethylene glycol) drug-delivery nanoparticles induce pro-inflammatory responses withCandida albicansinfection in a mouse model	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DENDRITIC CELLS; AUTOPHAGY; HALLMARK; IMMUNITY	In a recent study, using an in vitro model to study intravaginal nanoparticle exposure during yeast infections, we demonstrated thatC.albicansexposure suppressed apoptotic gene expression and induced oxidative stress and pyroptosis in vaginal epithelial cells. The mucous-penetrating drug delivery nanoparticles made from poly-(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-(polyethylene glycol) induced cytotoxicity by activating apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, and DNA damage repair responses alone and, in some cases withC.albicans. In the current study we evaluated the effects of fluorescently-labelled nanoparticles in CBA/J mice challenged intravaginally for two hours followed by intravaginal challenge withC.albicansfor 18 hours. Nanoparticle treatment increased systemic translocation ofC.albicansthreefold in the heart.C.albicansalso increased systemic distribution of the nanoparticles fivefold in the heart. Flow cytometric assays showed co-localization of the nanoparticles with epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Nanoparticle-treated,C.albicans-infected mice exhibited induction of autophagy, ER stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory serum cytokines.C.albicansinfection was associated with pyroptosis and suppressed expression of ER stress and apoptosis-related genes. Induction of apoptosis during nanoparticle treatment and in nanoparticle-treated-C.albicansinfected mice was observed as DNA damage responses, mitochondrial depolarization and (Poly [ADP-Ribose] Polymerase) cleavage.C.albicansinfection was associated with increased mRNA expression of anti-apoptotic genes. BothC.albicansinfection and nanoparticle treatment showed enhanced chemoattraction of dendritic cells and polymorphonuclear cells to factors in vaginal washings in a chemotaxis assay. This study shows that both intravaginal treatment of mice with the nanoparticles and infection withC.albicansinduce cytotoxic and inflammatory responses.C.albicansalso suppressed cell apoptosis. These results clarify our understanding of how nanoparticles modulate host cellular responses duringC.albicansinfection and will be applicable for future research and development of intravaginal nanomedicines.

Biological invasions alter environmental microbiomes: A meta-analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ACACIA-DEALBATA; SOIL MICROBES; GEN. NOV.; DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; ECOSYSTEMS; BACTERIAL; IMPACT; RICHNESS	Biological invasions impact both agricultural and natural systems. The damage can be quantified in terms of both economic loss and reduction of biodiversity. Although the literature is quite rich about the impact of invasive species on plant and animal communities, their impact on environmental microbiomes is underexplored. Here, we re-analyze publicly available data using a common framework to create a global synthesis of the effects of biological invasions on environmental microbial communities. Our findings suggest that non-native species are responsible for the loss of microbial diversity and shifts in the structure of microbial populations. Therefore, the impact of biological invasions on native ecosystems might be more pervasive than previously thought, influencing both macro- and micro-biomes. We also identified gaps in the literature which encourage research on a wider variety of environments and invaders, and the influence of invaders across seasons and geographical ranges.

This impact is particularly alarming in tropical countries like India, where similar to 18% of the world's population live, and its ever-growing economy (i.e., industrial development) expanded urban areas by several folds. We undertook this study to examine the impacts of urbanization (i.e., LULC) on terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Western Ghats, India. We sampled different habitats ranged from highly disturbed urban areas to less disturbed forested areas. Multiple sampling methods such as quadrat sampling, line transect, point count, and camera trapping were used to quantify the target taxa. We used multi-species occupancy modeling in the Bayesian framework to estimate detection probability and occupancy and to assess the effect of various LULC on different species. All four groups showed a significant negative impact of increasing anthropogenic habitat cover on occupancy. Out of 213 species detected in this study, 96% of mammals, 85% of birds, 93.75% of amphibians, and 69.43% of reptiles showed a negative effect of anthropogenic habitat cover. Evidence suggests that historical and recent human disturbances could have played an important role in transforming this area from semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forest to open, scrubby, dry deciduous, and fire-prone landscape. This might be the reason for the high occupancy of open and degraded forest habitat preferring species in our study area.

Materials and methods Fifty female patients (mean age, 61.3 years; age range, 50-79 years) who underwent both pre- and post-enhancement abdominopelvic CT scans were included in this retrospective study. Whole 3D volumes of the left proximal femur from the head to the lesser trochanter were extracted using the regional growth technique with commercial 3D software. Total volume, mean HU, and HU histogram analysis (HUHA) values of the extracted femur were calculated. HUHA distribution was classified into HUHA(fat)for the assumed fatty marrow (percentage of negative HU values) and HUHA(dense-bone)(percentage of HU values >= 126 HU). Reliability was assessed by calculating intra- and interobserver correlation coefficients (ICCs) and by drawing Bland-Altman plots. The effect of contrast medium administration was evaluated by the pairedt-test. Results All intra- and interobserver ICCs of 3D volume measurements showed excellent reproducibility (all ICCs > 0.90). On Bland-Altman analysis of two observers' 3D volume measurements, the differences in the mean total volume, HUHA(fat), HUHA(dense-bone), and mean HU were 2.4 cm(3), 0.17%, 0.6%, and 1.9 HU, respectively. The mean difference in HU after contrast agent administration (-2.2 HU) was not significant (P= 0.27). The mean difference in HUHA(fat)and HUHA(dense-bone)after contrast agent administration were -1.1% and -2.2%, respectively, on the Bland-Altman plot. HUHA(fat)and HUHA(dense-bone)showed significant differences (P< 0.05). The 95% limits of agreement for HUHA(fat), HUHA(dense-bone), and mean HU were -3.6% to 1.3%, -6.5% to 2.1%, and -30.0 to 25.5 HU, respectively. Conclusion Image analysis based on 3D volume measurement of the proximal femur showed excellent reliability, with the contrast agent administration showing negligible influence on the mean HU.

In silicocharacterisation of stand-alone response regulators ofStreptococcus pyogenes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GROUP-A STREPTOCOCCUS; MULTIPLE GENE REGULATOR; EMM TYPES; GENOME SEQUENCE; VIRULENCE GENES; PEROXIDE STRESS; EXPRESSION; PEPTIDE; SEROTYPE; MGA	Bacterial "stand-alone" response regulators (RRs) are pivotal to the control of gene transcription in response to changing cytosolic and extracellular microenvironments during infection. The genome of group AStreptococcus(GAS) encodes more than 30 stand-alone RRs that orchestrate the expression of virulence factors involved in infecting multiple tissues, so causing an array of potentially lethal human diseases. Here, we analysed the molecular epidemiology and biological associations in the coding sequences (CDSs) and upstream intergenic regions (IGRs) of 35 stand-alone RRs from a collection of global GAS genomes. Of the 944 genomes analysed, 97% encoded 32 or more of the 35 tested RRs. The length of RR CDSs ranged from 297 to 1587 nucleotides with an average nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.012, while the IGRs ranged from 51 to 666 nucleotides with average pi of 0.017. We present new evidence of recombination in multiple RRs includingmga, leading tomga-2switching,emm-switching andemm-like gene chimerization, and the first instance of an isolate that encodes bothmga-1andmga-2. Recombination was also evident inrofA/nraandmsmRloci with 15emm-types represented in multiple FCT (fibronectin-binding, collagen-binding, T-antigen)-types, including novelemm-type/FCT-type pairings. Strong associations were observed between concatenated RR allele types, andemm-type, MLST-type, core genome phylogroup, and country of sampling. No strong associations were observed between individual loci and disease outcome. We propose that 11 RRs may form part of future refinement of GAS typing systems that reflect core genome evolutionary associations. This subgenomic analysis revealed allelic traits that were informative to the biological function, GAS strain definition, and regional outbreak detection.

However, concerns remain about its contribution to select for antimalarial drug resistance. Methods We used Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR to determine the proportion of molecular markers associated with antimalarial resistance (k13,pfpm2,pfmdr1 and pfcrt) inPfisolates collected before (n = 99) and after (n = 112) the implementation of two monthly MDA rounds with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAp) for two consecutive years in Magude district of Southern Mozambique. Results None of thek13polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance were observed in thePfisolates analyzed. The proportion ofPfisolates with multiple copies ofpfpm2, an amplification associated with piperaquine resistance, was similar in pre- (4.9%) and post-MDA groups (3.4%; p = 1.000). No statistically significant differences were observed between pre- and post-MDA groups in the proportion ofPfisolates neither with mutations inpfcrtandpfmdr1genes, nor with the carriage ofpfmdr1multiple copies (p>0.05). Conclusions This study does not show any evidence of increased frequency of molecular makers of antimalarial resistance after MDA with DHAp in southern Mozambique where markers of antimalarial resistance were absent or low at the beginning of the intervention.

J	Kortje, M; Baumann, U; Stover, T; Weissgerber, T				Koertje, Monika; Baumann, Uwe; Stoever, Timo; Weissgerber, Tobias			Sensitivity to interaural time differences and localization accuracy in cochlear implant users with combined electric-acoustic stimulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOUND SOURCE LOCALIZATION; TEMPORAL-FINE-STRUCTURE; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; AUDITORY-SYSTEM; NORMAL-HEARING; NOISE; CUES; LISTENERS; RESPONSES; ENVELOPE	Objectives In this study, localization accuracy and sensitivity to acoustic interaural time differences (ITDs) in subjects using cochlear implants with combined electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) were assessed and compared with the results of a normal hearing control group. Methods Eight CI users with EAS (2 bilaterally implanted, 6 unilaterally implanted) and symmetric binaural acoustic hearing and 24 normal hearing subjects participated in the study. The first experiment determined mean localization error (MLE) for different angles of sound incidence between +/- 60 degrees (frontal and dorsal presentation). The stimuli were either low-pass, high-pass or broadband noise bursts. In a second experiment, just noticeable differences (JND) of ITDs were measured for pure tones of 125 Hz, 250 Hz and 500 Hz (headphone presentation). Results Experiment 1: MLE of EAS subjects was 8.5 degrees, 14.3 degrees and 14.7 degrees, (low-, high-pass and broadband stimuli respectively). In the control group, MLE was 1.8 degrees (broadband stimuli). In the differentiation between sound incidence from front and back, EAS subjects performed on chance level. Experiment 2: The JND-ITDs were 88.7 mu s for 125 Hz, 48.8 mu s for 250 Hz and 52.9 mu s for 500 Hz (EAS subjects). Compared to the control group, JND-ITD for 125 Hz was on the same level of performance. No statistically significant correlation was found between MLE and JND-ITD in the EAS cohort. Conclusions Near to normal ITD sensitivity in the lower frequency acoustic hearing was demonstrated in a cohort of EAS users. However, in an acoustic localization task, the majority of the subjects did not reached the level of accuracy of normal hearing. Presumably, signal processing time delay differences between devices used on both sides are deteriorating the transfer of precise binaural timing cues.

Most patients are diagnosed in late stages. Early diagnosis increases the chance of survival. We used the proximity extension assay from Olink Proteomics to search for new protein biomarkers with the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of CA125 and HE4 in patients with ovarian tumors. Material and methods Plasma samples were obtained from 180 women with ovarian tumors; 30 cases of benign tumor, 28 cases with borderline tumors, 25 early EOC cases (FIGO stage I) and 97 advanced EOC cases (FIGO stages II-IV). Proteins were measured using the Olink (R) Oncology II and Inflammation panels. For statistical analyses, patients were categorized into benign tumors versus cancer and benign tumors versus borderline + cancer, respectively. Results We analyzed 177 biomarkers. Thirty-four proteins had ROC AUC > 0.7 for discrimination between benign tumors and cancer. Fifteen proteins had ROC AUC > 0.7 for discrimination between benign tumors and borderline tumors + cancer. HE4 ranked highest for both comparisons. A reference model with HE4, CA125 and age (AUC 0.838 for benign tumors vs. cancer and AUC 0.770 for benign tumors vs. borderline tumors + cancer) was compared to the reference model with the addition of each of the remaining proteins with AUC > 0.7. ITGAV was the only individual biomarker found to improve diagnostic performance of the reference model, to AUC 0.874 for benign tumors vs. cancer and AUC 0.818 for benign tumors vs. borderline tumors + cancer (p < 0.05). Cross-validation and LASSO regression was combined to select multiple biomarker combinations. The best performing model for discrimination between benign tumors and borderline tumors + cancer was a 6-biomarker combination (HE4, CA125, ITGAV, CXCL1, CEACAM1, IL-10RB) and age (AUC 0.868, sensitivity 0.86 and specificity 0.82, p = 0.016 for comparison with the reference model). Conclusion HE4 was the best performing individual biomarker for discrimination between benign ovarian tumors and EOC including borderline tumors. The addition of other carcinogenesis-related biomarkers in a multiplex biomarker panel can improve the diagnostic performance of the established biomarkers HE4 and CA125.

Examination of a first-in-class bis-dialkylnorspermidine-terphenyl antibiotic in topical formulation against mono and polymicrobial biofilms	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIABETIC FOOT OSTEOMYELITIS; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; MUPIROCIN RESISTANCE; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; MANAGEMENT; SPECIMENS; CULTURE; GROWTH	Biofilm-impaired tissue is a significant factor in chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers. Most, if not all, anti-biotics in clinical use have been optimized against planktonic phenotypes. In this study, anin vitroassessment was performed to determine the potential efficacy of a first-in-class series of antibiofilm antibiotics and compare outcomes to current clinical standards of care. The agent, CZ-01179, was formulated into a hydrogel and tested against mature biofilms of a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureusandPseudomonas aeruginosaATCC 27853 using two separate methods. In the first method, biofilms were grown on cellulose discs on an agar surface. Topical agents were spread on gauze and placed over the biofilms for 24 h. Biofilms were quantified and imaged with confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In the second method, biofilms were grown on bioabsorbable collagen coupons in a modified CDC biofilm reactor. Coupons were immersed in treatment for 24 h. The first method was limited in its ability to assess efficacy. Efficacy profiles against biofilms grown on collagen were more definitive, with CZ-01179 gel eradicating well-established biofilms to a greater degree compared to clinical standards. In conclusion, CZ-01179 may be a promising topical agent that targets the biofilm phenotype. Pre-clinical work is currently being performed to determine the translatable potential of CZ-01179 gel.

J	Zheng, YM				Zheng, Yingming			The use of deep learning algorithm and digital media art in all-media intelligent electronic music system	PLOS ONE			English	Article								In the development of digital media art, to explore the preliminary application of deep learning method in intelligent electronic music system, and promote the integration of deep learning method and digital media technology, thus providing a direction for the development of all media intelligent system, based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), to solve the multi-task problem in intelligent system, a multi-task learning-based DDPG algorithm (M-DDPG) is proposed. Furthermore, a DDPG algorithm based on hierarchical learning (H-DDPG) is proposed for the hierarchical analysis of images in intelligent system. Aiming at the problem of image classification in intelligent system, through the setting of simulation environment, the application effect of several algorithms in intelligent electronic music system is evaluated. The results show that: M-DDPG algorithm can more accurately complete the operation of related tasks, the reward received by the intelligent system is more than 0.35, and the test results based on eight tasks are more accurate and effective. Even in the case of task error, the algorithm still shows good training results. H-DDPG algorithm has good effect for complex task processing. The accuracy rate of task test corresponding to intelligent system in different scenarios is above 95%, which is better than other conventional algorithms in task test; the self-reinforcement network algorithm can promote the improvement of image classification effect. Several algorithms proposed show excellent performance in image processing of intelligent system, and have great application potential.

We also found that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could attenuate maternal CS exposure-induced impairment of central chemoreception in the rat offspringin vivo. Mitochondrial ATP sensitive potassium (mitoK(ATP)) channel has been reported to play a significant role in mitochondrial functions and protect against apoptosis in neurons. Thus, we hypothesize here that mitoK(ATP)channel plays a role in the protective effects of H2S on neonatal central chemoreception in maternal CS-exposed rats. Our findings revealed that pretreatment with NaHS (donor of H2S, 22.4mM) reversed the central chemosensitivity decreased by maternal CS exposure, and also inhibited cell apoptosis in offspring pFRG, however, 5-HD (blocker of mitoK(ATP)channels, 19mM) attenuated the protective effects of NaHS. In addition, NaHS declined pro-apoptotic proteins related to mitochondrial pathway apoptosis in CS rat offspring pFRG, such as Bax, Cytochrome C, caspase9 and caspase3. NaHS or 5-HD alone had no significant effect on above indexes. These results suggest that mitoK(ATP)channels play an important role in the protective effect of H2S against impairment of central chemoreception via anti-apoptosis in pFRG of rat offspring exposed to maternal CS.

Transcriptome data reveal conserved patterns of fruiting body development and response to heat stress in the mushroom-forming fungus Flammulina filiformis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSTREPLICATION REPAIR GENE; WINTER MUSHROOM; COPRINUS-CINEREUS; GENOME SEQUENCE; FAMILY PROTEINS; VELUTIPES; MORPHOGENESIS; AQUAPORINS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; PURIFICATION	Mushroom-forming fungi are complex multicellular organisms that form the basis of a large industry, yet, our understanding of the mechanisms of mushroom development and its responses to various stresses remains limited. The winter mushroom (Flammulina filiformis) is cultivated at a large commercial scale in East Asia and is a species with a preference for low temperatures. This study investigated fruiting body development in F. filiformis by comparing transcriptomes of 4 developmental stages, and compared the developmental genes to a 200-genome dataset to identify conserved genes involved in fruiting body development, and examined the response of heat sensitive and -resistant strains to heat stress. Our data revealed widely conserved genes involved in primordium development of F. filiformis, many of which originated before the emergence of the Agaricomycetes, indicating co-option for complex multicellularity during evolution. We also revealed several notable fruiting-specific genes, including the genes with conserved stipe-specific expression patterns and the others which related to sexual development, water absorption, basidium formation and sporulation, among others. Comparative analysis revealed that heat stress induced more genes in the heat resistant strain (M1) than in the heat sensitive one (XR). Of particular importance are the hsp70, hsp90 and fes1 genes, which may facilitate the adjustment to heat stress in the early stages of fruiting body development. These data highlighted novel genes involved in complex multicellular development in fungi and aid further studies on gene function and efforts to improve the productivity and heat tolerance in mushroom-forming fungi.

The COVID-19 public health crisis is a significant, global, and (mostly) simultaneous test of the behavioral implications arising from this confidence. We explore whether populations reporting low levels of confidence in the health care system exhibit a stronger behavioral reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. We track the dynamic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across 38 European countries and 621 regions by employing a large dataset on human mobility generated between February 15 and June 5, 2020 and a broad range of contextual factors (e.g., deaths or policy implementations). Using a time-dynamic framework we find that societies with low levels of health care confidence initially exhibit a faster response with respect to staying home. However, this reaction plateaus sooner, and after the plateau it declines with greater magnitude than does the response from societies with high health care confidence. On the other hand, regions with higher confidence in the health care system are more likely to reduce mobility once the government mandates that its citizens are not to leave home except for essential trips, compared to those with lower health care system confidence. Regions with high trust in the government but low confidence in the health care system dramatically reduce their mobility, suggesting a correlation for trust in the state with respect to behavioral responses during a crisis.

Knowledge of prognostic factors in affected patients can help optimize care. Objective The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 and the form of presentation of the disease, the previous pathologies of patients and their chronic treatments. Design, participants and locations This was an observational study on a cohort of 418 patients admitted to three regional hospitals in Catalonia (Spain). As primary outcomes, severe disease (need for oxygen therapy via nonrebreather mask or mechanical ventilation) and death were studied. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were performed to study the association between the different factors and the results. Results Advanced age, male sex and obesity were independent markers of poor prognosis. The most frequent presenting symptom was fever, while dyspnea was associated with severe disease and the presence of cough with greater survival. Low oxygen saturation in the emergency room, elevated CRP in the emergency room and initial radiological involvement were all related to worse prognosis. The presence of eosinophilia (% of eosinophils) was an independent marker of less severe disease. Conclusions This study identified the most robust markers of poor prognosis for COVID-19.

In order to evaluate the impact of trail bridges in rural Rwanda, it is helpful to objectively know how and when they are being used. In this study, we deployed motion-activated digital cameras across several trail bridges installed by the non-profit Bridges to Prosperity. We conducted and validated manual counting of bridge use to establish a ground truth. We adapted an open source computer vision algorithm to identify and count bridge use reflected in the digital images. We found a reliable correlation with less than 3% error bias of bridge crossings per hour between manual counting and those sites at which the cameras logged short video clips. We applied this algorithm across 186 total days of observation at four sites in fall 2019, and observed a total of 33,800 daily bridge crossings ranging from about 20 to over 1,100 individual uses per day, with no apparent correlation between daily or total weekly rainfall and bridge use, potentially indicating that transportation behaviors, after a bridge is installed, are no longer impacted by rainfall conditions. Higher bridge use was observed in the late afternoons, on market and church days, and roughly equal use of the bridge crossings in each direction. These trends are consistent with the design-intent of these bridges.

They are deeply geographically structured and characterized by high complexity of the genetic background associated with variable clinical severities. Due to this heterogeneity we investigated the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA marker variations in patients with hemoglobinopathies in order to provide the first comprehensive genetic stratification of these hereditary disease. This study contributes to detail the multifaceted picture of hemoglobin disorders. The hemoglobin disorders are the most common single gene disorders in the world. Previous studies have suggested that they are deeply geographically structured and a variety of genetic determinants influences different clinical phenotypes between patients inheriting identical beta-globin gene mutations. In order to get new insights into the heterogeneity of hemoglobin disorders, we investigated the molecular variations on nuclear genes (i.e.HBB,HBG2,BCL11A,HBS1LandMYB)and mitochondrial DNA control region. This pilot study was carried out on 53 patients belonging to different continents and molecularly classified in 4 subgroup: beta-thalassemia (beta(+)/beta(+),beta(0)/beta(0)and beta(+)/beta(0))(15), sickle cell disease(HbS/HbS)(20), sickle cell/beta-thalassemia (HbS/beta(+)or HBS/beta(0))(10), and non-thalassemic compound heterozygous (HbS/HbC,HbO-Arab/HbC)(8). This comprehensive phylogenetic analysis provided a clear separation between African and European patients either in nuclear or mitochondrial variations. Notably, informing on the phylogeographic structure of affected individuals, this accurate genetic stratification, could help to optimize the diagnostic algorithm for patients with uncertain or unknown origin.

Coastal restoration evaluated using dominant habitat characteristics and associated fish communities	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMMON SNOOK; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; MANGROVE FORESTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; SALT-MARSHES; TAMPA BAY; COMPLEXITY; ESTUARINE	Increasing coastal populations and urban development have led to the loss of estuarine habitats for fish and wildlife. Specifically, a decline in complexity and heterogeneity of tidal marshes and creeks is thought to negatively impact fish communities by altering the function of nursery grounds, including predator refuge and prey resources. To offset these impacts, numerous agencies are restoring degraded habitats while also creating new ones where habitat has been lost. To improve understanding of what contributes to a successful restoration, six quarterly sampling events using two gear types to collect small- and large-bodied fishes were conducted to compare the fish community structure and habitat characteristics at three natural, three restored, and three impacted (i.e. ditched) areas along the coast of Tampa Bay, Florida. Overall, impacted sites had significantly lower small-bodied and juvenile fish diversity than natural and restored areas, while restored sites harbored a greater number of fish species than impacted sites for both large- and small-bodied fish. Habitat features such as shoreline slope differentiated impacted and restored from natural areas. Although we did not find a direct correlation, habitat heterogeneity likely played a role in structuring fish communities. These findings provide guidance for future coastal restoration or modification of existing projects. Specifically, the habitat mosaic approach of creating a geographically compact network of heterogenous habitat characteristics is likely to support fish diversity, while decreasing shoreline slope in a greater amount of area within coastal wetland restorations would more closely mimic natural areas.

J	Sendall, MC; Brodie, A				Sendall, Marguerite C.; Brodie, Alison			Postgraduate health promotion students' perceptions of at-risk populations: Those who smoke tobacco, are overweight or obese or drink alcohol at hazardous levels	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTITUDES; DOCTORS	Perceptions acquired during tertiary health promotion education can influence students' interactions with their future service-users. Reflective practice can highlight these perceptions. Here we describe the findings of a reflective exercise conducted with postgraduate health promotion students as part of a learning activity. Students (n = 44) reflected on their understandings of at-risk populations in three priority areas-tobacco, obesity and alcohol. The activity aimed to deconstruct students' understandings of these populations and identify understandings juxtaposed to the philosophical underpinnings of health promotion, for addressing through teaching and learning. Thematic analysis revealed students' understanding of all three at-risk populations fit within five themes: apathy/lack of altruism, complexity/choice, pressure/control, escaping /excuses, and environmental contexts. Students also have varying levels of tolerance to at-risk populations, expressing greatest tolerance towards those whose addiction undermines choice and self-control, and least towards those who are overweight/obese or whose behaviour causes risk to others. Our findings show reflective practice is a valuable tool to help educators understand students' attitudes and values and implement changes to support their future role in the community.

J	Suglo, JN; Evans, C				Suglo, Joseph Ngmenesegre; Evans, Catrin			Factors influencing self-management in relation to type 2 diabetes in Africa: A qualitative systematic review	PLOS ONE			English	Review							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; HEALTH; MELLITUS; EXPERIENCES; ILLNESS; WOMEN; CARE; BELIEFS; GHANA; MEN	Aim Effective control of type 2 diabetes is predicated upon the ability of a person with diabetes to adhere to self-management activities. In order to develop and implement services that are locally relevant and culturally acceptable, it is critical to understand people's experiences of living with the disease. We synthesized qualitative research evidence describing the views and experiences of persons with type 2 diabetes in Africa regarding diabetes self-management. Methods Five data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS and CINAHL) were searched for qualitative studies published between the year 2000 and December 2019. After study selection, the included papers were critically appraised using an established tool. The data were extracted, and findings were coded and analysed to identify descriptive and analytical themes using a thematic synthesis approach. This review was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) with registration number CRD42018102255. Results Sixteen studies were included in this review, representing a total of 426 participants across seven countries. Synthesis of findings produced six analytical themes. The diagnosis of diabetes triggered a range of emotions and revealed culturally specific understandings of the condition that negatively affected self-management practices. People with diabetes seeking health care at hospitals encountered several challenges including long waiting times and costly diabetes treatment. Family support and a state of acceptance of the condition were identified as facilitators to diabetes self-management. Conclusion Effective self-management of type 2 diabetes is a challenge for most persons with diabetes in Africa. There is an urgent need for culturally appropriate education strategies and restructuring of the health system to facilitate self-management of diabetes.

This landbridge, however, should have crossed the Caribbean oceanic plate, and the geological evolution of its rise and demise, or its geodynamic forcing, remain unknown. Here we present the results of a land-sea survey from the northeast Caribbean plate, combined with chronostratigraphic data, revealing a regional episode of mid to late Eocene, trench-normal, E-W shortening and crustal thickening by similar to 25%. This shortening led to a regional late Eocene-early Oligocene hiatus in the sedimentary record revealing the location of an emerged land (the Greater Antilles-Northern Lesser Antilles, or GrANoLA, landmass), consistent with the GAARlandia hypothesis. Subsequent submergence is explained by combined trench-parallel extension and thermal relaxation following a shift of arc magmatism, expressed by a regional early Miocene transgression. We tentatively link the NE Caribbean intra-plate shortening to a well-known absolute and relative North American and Caribbean plate motion change, which may provide focus for the search of the remaining connection between 'GrANoLA' land and South America, through the Aves Ridge or Lesser Antilles island arc. Our study highlights the how regional geodynamic evolution may have driven paleogeographic change that is still reflected in current biology.

J	Arbel, Y; Fialkoff, C; Kerner, A				Arbel, Yuval; Fialkoff, Chaim; Kerner, Amichai			The cause and effect problem: Is there mutual obesity among Arab Israeli couples?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX	The influence of the health-related behavior of one spouse on that of the other is an important research question with public policy reprecussions. Yet, we are unaware of any previous study, which considered endogeneity problems between couples. Moreover, only a few studies considered ethnic origin differences among couples. Based on the 2016 wave of the Israeli longitudinal survey, we observe the cross-sectional correlation between the married couples'BMI, age, and accumulated wealth. TheBMI(=kgmeter2) is a conventional measure of obesity, whereBMI >= 25 is considered overweight. Using a 3SLS methodology (in an effort to correct the endogeneity problem associated withBMIcouples), the analysis tests the mutual obesity hypothesis among married couples. This hypothesis states that theBMIof the male influences that of a female and vice versa. Results indicate that on the one hand, a one-percentBMIincrease among Arab Israeli males is associated with a projected 0.969 percent BMI increase among Arab Israeli females (p= 0.017); and in the case that an Arab Israeli male suffers from overweight, the projected probability of his Arab Israeli female counterpart to suffer from overweight as wellrises(p= 0.050). On the other hand, one cannot reject the null hypothesis that projectedBMIof the Arab Israeli male is unaffected by that of his Arab Israeli female counterpart (p= 0.907 andp= 0.853). As for the Jewish Israeli population, in the case that the 3SLS methodology is employed, so that the endogeneity problem among couples is considered, a one-percentBMIincrease among Jewish Israeli females is associated with a projected 0.639 percentBMIincrease among Jewish Israeli males (p= 0.091). Unlike Arab Israeli couples, no support is found to indicate the influence in the other direction, namely, theBMIof the male influences that of the female spouse. Research findings may thus be of relevance to public health and policy planners. Two limitations of this research lie in: 1) the self-reportedBMI(which might be different from the measuredBMI); and 2) missing confounders, such as regional dummies, which are not available in the dataset.

We implemented the PrEP Optimization Intervention (PrEP-OI) combining a PrEP Coordinator with an online panel management tool to assist providers with PrEP uptake, persistence, and management in 12 San Francisco Department of Public Health Primary Care Clinics. Medical directors (N = 10) identified important factors to consider prior to implementation, including shortage of clinical space for coordinators, medical mistrust, language barriers, and limited lab hours, along with the need for education of providers and staff and patient outreach. Among 110 providers who completed a baseline survey, the majority had reservations in asking about sexual practices and having conversations about PrEP. Providers reported PrEP-OI increased their efficiency and capacity to manage PrEP patients, and served as a gateway to additional services. These results highlight the promise of a provider-based intervention to improve the PrEP continuum and maximize the impact of PrEP.

Impact of truck contamination and information sharing on foot-and-mouth disease spreading in beef cattle production systems	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SIMULATION-MODEL; NETWORK ANALYSIS; EPIDEMIC; TRANSMISSION; STRATEGIES; DAIRY	As cattle movement data in the United States are scarce due to the absence of mandatory traceability programs, previous epidemic models for U.S. cattle production systems heavily rely on contact rates estimated based on expert opinions and survey data. These models are often based on static networks and ignore the sequence of movement, possibly overestimating the epidemic sizes. In this research, we adapt and employ an agent-based model that simulates beef cattle production and transportation in southwest Kansas to analyze the between-premises transmission of a highly contagious disease, foot-and-mouth disease. First, we assess the impact of truck contamination on the disease transmission with the truck agent following an independent clean-infected-clean cycle. Second, we add an information-sharing functionality such that producers/packers can trace back and forward their trade records to inform their trade partners during outbreaks. Scenario analysis results show that including indirect contact routes between premises via truck movements can significantly increase the amplitude of disease spread, compared with equivalent scenarios that only consider animal movement. Mitigation strategies informed by information sharing can effectively mitigate epidemics, highlighting the benefit of promoting information sharing in the cattle industry. In addition, we identify salient characteristics that must be considered when designing an information-sharing strategy, including the number of days to trace back and forward in the trade records and the role of different cattle supply chain stakeholders. Sensitivity analysis results show that epidemic sizes are sensitive to variations in parameters of the contamination period for a truck or a loading/unloading area of premises, and indirect contact transmission probability and future studies can focus on a more accurate estimation of these parameters.

Purpose The goal of this article is to offer a preliminary assessment of the cultural competence of nurses based on a Polish-language and -culture version of the Nurse Cultural Competence Scale (NCCS). Research method An adaptive and diagnostic cross-disciplinary concept was used in the research. Two hundred thirty-eight professionally active nurses in the southeast region of Poland took part in this study. The NCCS-Polish version (NCCS-P) questionnaire was used after linguistic adaptation and analysis of psychometric properties. Results Moderate levels of competence in the Cultural Knowledge Subscale (M = 3.42) were found in the group of nurses studied. The results indicate lowest competency levels in the Cultural Skill Subscale (M = 3.14). The highest values were obtained for the Cultural Awareness Subscale (M = 3.98) and the Cultural Sensitivity Subscale (M = 3.72). The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for the NCCS-P scale was 0.94, with the subscale values ranging from 0.72 to 0.95. Factor validity analysis of the Polish adaptation of the NCCS-P scale pointed to its four-factor structure. The Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin sampling adequacy test was 0.905, and the Bartlett test of sphericity result was chi(2) = 5755.107; df = 820; p<0.001. The four-factor structure is affirmed by the Kaiser criterion and the scree test result. Conclusions The NCCS-P psychometric properties were highly reliable and significant because of the opportunity for using them for research in Poland.

Bone biodeterioration-The effect of marine and terrestrial depositional environments on early diagenesis and bone bacterial community	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BIOEROSION; SUCCESSION; COLLAGEN; TUNNELS; DEATH; TIME	Bacteria play an important role in the degradation of bone material. However, much remains to be learnt about the structure of their communities in degrading bone, and how the depositional environment influences their diversity throughout the exposure period. We genetically profiled the bacterial community in an experimental series of pig bone fragments (femur and humeri) deposited at different well-defined environments in Denmark. The bacterial community in the bone fragments and surrounding depositional environment were studied over one year, and correlated with the bioerosion damage patterns observed microscopically in the bones. We observed that the bacterial communities within the bones were heavily influenced by the local microbial community, and that the general bone microbial diversity increases with time after exposure. We found the presence of several known collagenase producing bacterial groups, and also observed increases in the relative abundance of several of these in bones with tunneling. We anticipate that future analyses using shotgun metagenomics on this and similar datasets will be able to provide insights into mechanisms of microbiome driven bone degradation.

J	Mkondiwa, M				Mkondiwa, Maxwell			Mancala board games and origins of entrepreneurship in Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CULTURE; STRATEGY; CENTRALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; BEHAVIOR; BELIEFS; MODEL	This study examines the correlational relationship between the historical playing of indigenous strategic board games (also called mancala) and the socio-economic complexity of African ethnic groups as well as the incidence of entrepreneurial pursuits. Anthropology literature suggests that these games may be associated with socio-economic complexity of the ethnic groups-the so-called games in culture hypothesis. I revisit this hypothesis with better data and motivated by anecdotal evidence, introduce a contemporary hypothesis, origins of entrepreneurship hypothesis-that descendants of societies that played complex mancala games are more likely to be engaged in non-farm self-employment today. I compile the first comprehensive database of mancala games in Africa matched to ancestral characteristics data, and for 18 African countries, to the Afrobarometer survey data.

However, the factors associated have not been well characterised in different settings. This study describes barriers and enablers of adherence to infant prophylaxis among 6-week-old HIV exposed infants in Lira district, Northern Uganda. Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted from 2018-2020 at the PMTCT clinic at Lira Regional Referral Hospital and included 472 mother-infant pairs. HIV-infected pregnant women were recruited, followed up at delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain data on socio-demographic, reproductive-related, HIV-related characteristics and adherence. Data were analysed using Stata to estimate adjusted risk ratios using Poisson regression models to ascertain barriers and enablers of adherence to infant nevirapine prophylaxis. Results Barriers to infant adherence are maternal characteristics including: younger age (<= 20 years adjusted risk ratio (ARR) = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.1-2.2), missing a viral load test during pregnancy (ARR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7) and not receiving nevirapine syrup for the baby after childbirth (ARR = 6.2; 95% CI: 5.1-7.6). Enablers were: having attained >= 14 years of schooling (ARR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5-0.9), taking a nevirapine-based regimen (ARR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9), long-term ART (>= 60 months ARR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.6-0.9), accompanied by a husband to hospital during labour and childbirth (ARR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4-0.7) and labour starting at night (ARR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6-0.8). Conclusion and recommendations Despite mothers receiving nevirapine syrup from the health workers for the infant, non-adherence rates still prevail at 14.8%. The health system needs to consider giving HIV infected pregnant women the nevirapine syrup before birth to avoid delays and non-adherence. There is need to pay particular attention to younger women and those who recently started ART.

Screening of targeted panel genes in Brazilian patients with primary ovarian insufficiency	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HOMOZYGOUS 1-BP DELETION; UBIQUITIN LIGASE; MUTATIONS; GENETICS; VARIANTS; GENOMICS; FAILURE; PROTEIN; GROWTH; MOUSE	Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a heterogeneous disorder associated with several genes. The majority of cases are still unsolved. Our aim was to identify the molecular diagnosis of a Brazilian cohort with POI. Genetic analysis was performed using a customized panel of targeted massively parallel sequencing (TMPS) and the candidate variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Additional copy number variation (CNV) analysis of TMPS samples was performed by CONTRA. Fifty women with POI (29 primary amenorrhea and 21 secondary amenorrhea) of unknown molecular diagnosis were included in this study, which was conducted in a tertiary referral center of clinical endocrinology. A genetic defect was obtained in 70% women with POI using the customized TMPS panel. Twenty-four pathogenic variants and two CNVs were found in 48% of POI women. Of these variants, 16 genes were identified as BMP8B, CPEB1, INSL3, MCM9, GDF9, UBR2, ATM, STAG3, BMP15, BMPR2, DAZL, PRDM1, FSHR, EIF4ENIF1, NOBOX, and GATA4. Moreover, a microdeletion and microduplication in the CPEB1 and SYCE1 genes, respectively, were also identified in two distinct patients. The genetic analysis of eleven patients was classified as variants of uncertain clinical significance whereas this group of patients harbored at least two variants in different genes. Thirteen patients had benign or no rare variants, and therefore the genetic etiology remained unclear. In conclusion, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a highly effective approach to identify the genetic diagnoses of heterogenous disorders, such as POI. A molecular etiology allowed us to improve the disease knowledge, guide decisions about prevention or treatment, and allow familial counseling avoiding future comorbidities.

Mathematical models of plant-pollinator interactions can help understand key determinants in pollination success. However, most previous models have not addressed pollinator behavior and plant biology combined. Information generated from such a model can inform optimal design of crop orchards and effective utilization of managed pollinators like western honey bees (Apis mellifera), and help generate hypotheses about the effects of management practices and cultivar selection. We expect that the number of honey bees per flower and male to female flower ratio will influence fruit yield. To test the relative importance of these effects, both singly and simultaneously, we utilized a delay differential equation model combined with Latin hypercube sampling for sensitivity analysis. Empirical data obtained from historical records and collected in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) orchards in New Zealand were used to parameterize the model. We found that, at realistic bee densities, the optimal orchard had 65-75% female flowers, and the most benefit was gained from the first 6-8 bees/1000 flowers, with diminishing returns thereafter. While bee density significantly impacted fruit production, plant-based parameters-flower density and male:female flower ratio-were the most influential. The predictive model provides strategies for improving crop management, such as choosing cultivars which have their peak bloom on the same day, increasing the number of flowers with approximately 70% female flowers in the orchard, and placing enough hives to maintain more than 6 bees per 1000 flowers to optimize yield.

A simulation study of the use of temporal occupancy for identifying core and transient species	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RICHNESS; ABUNDANCE; HETEROGENEITY	Transient species, which do not maintain self-sustaining populations in a system where they are observed, are ubiquitous in nature and their presence often impacts the interpretation of ecological patterns and processes. Identifying transient species from temporal occupancy, the proportion of time a species is observed at a given site over a time series, is subject to classification errors as a result of imperfect detection and source-sink dynamics. We use a simulation-based approach to assess how often errors in detection or classification occur in order to validate the use of temporal occupancy as a metric for inferring whether a species is a core or transient member of a community. We found that low detection increases error in the classification of core species, while high habitat heterogeneity and high detection increase error in classification of transient species. These findings confirm that temporal occupancy is a valid metric for inferring whether a species can maintain a self-sustaining population, but imperfect detection, low abundance, and highly heterogeneous landscapes may yield high misclassification rates.

The aim of this study is to explore the degree of psychological distress in terms of-Depression, Anxiety and Stress among the adult population in India during the strict 21 days mandatory lockdown. We hypothesize that quantification of psychological impact of current situation will help us to modify the policies and implementation strategies. This assessment might also help in future to keep targeted services in place, to cope up with the psychological distress of the quarantined population. Method A cross sectional survey design was adopted to assess the psychological state of general population in India, during the COVID-19 mandatory lockdown period, with the help of a validated questionnaire. Findings The reported prevalence of depression was around 30.5%, which was the highest among the variables of psychological health. Anxiety was reported by 22.4%, followed by stress which was seen in 10.8% of respondents. In the third week the incidence of depression (37.8% versus 23.4%; p<0.001), anxiety (26.6% versus 18.2%; p<0.001) and stress (12.2% versus 9.3%; p<0.045) was reported to be significantly higher as compared to second week. Interpretation Our results suggest a progressively detrimental impact of lockdown on various aspects of psychological health. We noticed around eight to ten fold increase in the prevalence of depression (30.5%) and anxiety (22.4%) during lockdown, as compared to baseline statistics in Indian population (3 center dot 1-3 center dot 6% for depressive disorders and 3 center dot 0-3 center dot 5% for anxiety disorders).

As a preventive measure to minimise the risk of community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in India, a nationwide lockdown was imposed initially for 21 days to limit the movement of 1.3 billion people. These restrictions continue in most areas, with a conditional relaxation occurring in a few Indian states. In an attempt to assess the emerging mutants of SARS-CoV-2 and determine their spread in India, we analysed 112 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in a time-lapse manner. We found 72 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes, defined by 143 polymorphic sites and high haplotype diversity, suggesting that this virus possesses a high evolutionary potential. We also demonstrated that early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into India was from China, Italy and Iran and observed signs of community spread of the virus following its rapid demographic expansion since its first outbreak in the country. Additionally, we identified 18 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and a few selected mutations showed to increase stability, binding affinity, and molecular flexibility in the overall tertiary structure of the protein that may facilitate interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The study provides a pragmatic view of haplotype-dependent spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India which could be important in tailoring the pharmacologic treatments to be more effective for those infected with the most common haplotypes. The findings based on the time-lapse sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 will aid in the development of a real-time practical framework to tackle the ongoing, fast-evolving epidemic challenges in the country.

Factors affecting peak impact force during soccer headers and implications for the mitigation of head injuries	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-SCHOOL; UNITED-STATES; CONCUSSIONS; FOOTBALL; PERFORMANCE; PLAYERS	It has been documented that up to 22% of all soccer injuries are concussions. This is in part due to players purposely using their head to direct the ball during play. To provide a more complete understanding of head trauma in soccer athletes, this study characterized the effects of four soccer ball characteristics (size, inflation pressure, mass, velocity) on the resulting peak impact force as it relates to the potential for incurring neurophysiological changes. A total of six hundred trials were performed on size 4 and 5 soccer balls as well as a novel lightweight soccer ball. Impact force was measured with a force plate and ball velocity was determined using motion capture. These data were used, in conjunction with dimensional analysis to relate impact force to ball size, mass, velocity, and pressure. Reasonable reductions in allowable ball parameters resulted in a 19.7% decrease in peak impact force. Adjustments to ball parameters could reduce a high cumulative peak translational acceleration soccer athlete down into a previously defined safer low loading range. In addition, it was noted that water absorption by soccer balls can result in masses that substantially increase impact force and quickly surpass the NCAA weight limit for game play. Additional research is required to determine whether varying soccer ball characteristics will enable soccer players to avoid persistent neurophysiological deficits or what additional interventions may be necessary and the legal implications of these data are discussed.

At the same time, colonization and consecutive infections with such pathogens may increase mortality and morbidity of affected individuals. We aimed to monitor intestinal MDRGN colonization in a yet not investigated German HD population. Methods We performed cross-sectional point-prevalence testing with 12 months follow-up and selected testing of relatives in an out-patient HD cohort of n = 77 patients by using microbiological cultures from fresh stool samples, combined with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Results We detected MDRGN in 8 out of 77 patients (10.4%) and 1 out of 22 relatives (4.5%), indicating only colonization and no infections. At follow-up, 2 patients showed phenotypic persistence of MDRGN colonization, and in 6 other patients de-novo MDRGN colonization could be demonstrated. Pathogens includedEscherichia coliandKlebsiella pneumoniae(with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-production as well as fluoroquinolone resistance),Stenotrophomonas maltophiliaandEnterobacter cloacae. Conclusions In a single-center study, MDRGN colonization rates were below those found in non-HD high-risk populations and HD units in the US, respectively. Reasons for this could be high hygiene standards and a strict antibiotic stewardship policy with evidence of low consumption of fluoroquinolones and carbapenems in our HD unit and the affiliated hospital.

One of the strategies for prevention of deleterious effects related to obesity and overweight is engaging in regular physical activity, of which high intensity interval training (HIIT) is efficient in promoting biogenesis and improving the function of mitochondria. Therefore, our aims were to investigate the effects of HIIT on metabolic and neuro-cardiovascular dynamic control and mitochondrial swelling induced by high-fat diet (HFD). Methods and results Twenty-three male Wistar rats (60 - 80g) were divided into 4 subgroups: control (C), HIIT, HFD and HFD+HIIT. The whole experimentation period lasted for 22 weeks and HIIT sessions were performed 5 days a week during the last 4 weeks. At the end of the experiments, fasting glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed. Cerebral microcirculation was analyzed using cortical intravital microscopy for capillary diameter and functional density. Cardiac function and ergoespirometric parameters were also investigated. Mitochondrial swelling was evaluated on brain and heart extracts. HFD promoted an increase on body adiposity (p<0.001), fasting glucose levels (p<0.001), insulin resistance index (p<0.05), cardiac hypertrophy index (p<0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.05), along with worsened cardiac function (p<0.05), reduced functional cerebral capillary density (p<0.05) and its diameter (p<0.01), and heart and brain mitochondrial function (p<0.001). HFD did not affect any ergoespirometric parameter. After 4 weeks of training, HIIT was able to improve cardiac hypertrophy index, diastolic blood pressure, cerebral functional capillary density (p<0.01) and heart and brain mitochondrial swelling (p<0.001). Conclusion In animals subjected to HFD, HIIT ameliorated both cerebral mitochondrial swelling and functional capillary density, but it did not improve cardiovascular function suggesting that the cardiovascular dysfunction elicited by HFD was not due to heart mitochondrial swelling.

Thus, this study collected over 750,000 words upon the topic of COVID-19 and agriculture from the largest two media channels in China: WeChat and Sina Weibo, and employed web crawler technology and text mining method to explore the influence of COVID-19 on agricultural economy and mitigation measures in China. The results show that: (1) the impact of COVID-19 on China's agricultural economy at the very first phase is mainly reflected in eight aspects as crop production, agricultural products supply, livestock production, farmers' income and employment, economic crop development, agricultural products sales model, leisure agriculture development, and agricultural products trade. (2) The government's immediate countermeasures include resuming agricultural production and farmers' work, providing financial support, stabilizing agricultural production and products supply, promoting agricultural products sale, providing subsidies, providing agricultural technology guidance and field management, and providing assistance to poor farmers to reduce poverty. (3) The order of government's immediate countermeasures is not all in line with the order of impact aspects, which indicates that more-tailored policies should be implemented to mitigate the strikes of COVID-19 on China's agricultural economy in the future.

It is also of zoonotic importance and has been reported to cause devastating human infections globally. Domestic ruminants represent the most frequent source of human infection. Data from Nigeria are very few and outdated. There is a significant gap in up-to-date information on the exposure, spatial distribution and risk factors of infection of this important disease. The exposure toC.burnetiiwas determined using sensitive serological assays in cattle and small ruminants. A total of 538 animals made up of 268 cattle and 270 small ruminants were sampled from three northern Nigerian states. The proportion of cattle sampled that were seropositive from the study locations were: Kwara 14/90 (15.6%; 95% CI: 8.8-24.7); Plateau 10/106 (9.43%; 95% CI: 4.6-16.7) and Borno 4/72 (5.56%; 95% CI: 1.5-13.6) states. Lower seroprevalence was recorded among the small ruminants sampled, with positives recorded from sheep and goat sampled from only Kwara state 6/184 (3.3%; 95% CI: 1.2-7.0); while none of the small ruminants sampled from Plateau were seropositive. The results of the bivariate analysis showed that none of the tested independent variables (village, age group, sex, breed of cattle, presence of ticks, reproductive status, and management system) were statistically significant factors associated with seropositivity of cattle for antibodies toC.burnetii. Stakeholders involved in animal husbandry should be duly educated on proper disposal of birth products as well as bodily fluids in order to reduce environmental contamination, persistence and human infection.

Poverty and historic and current immigration from high TB incidence parts of the world are two major drivers of tuberculosis in England. However, little has been done in recent years to examine socio-economic trends in TB rates in England, and to disentangle the role of deprivation from that of place of birth in the current TB epidemiology. Objectives To assess the association between England's 2008-2012 TB notification rates and small area-level deprivation, together and separately in the UK-born and foreign-born populations. Methods Ecological analysis of the association between quintiles of England's 2010 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and TB rates at the Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA; average population similar to 1500) level, using negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models, adjusting for age, sex, urban/rural area classification, and area-level percentage of non-White residents. Results There was a log-linear gradient between area-deprivation levels and TB rates, with overall TB rates in the most deprived quintile areas three times higher than the least deprived quintile after adjustment for age and sex (IRR = 3.35; 95%CI: 3.16 to 3.55). The association and gradient were stronger in the UK-born than the foreign-born population, with UK-born TB rates in the most deprived quintiles about two-and-a-half times higher than the least deprived quintile (IRR = 2.39; 95%CI: 2.19 to 2.61) after controlling for age, sex, urban/rural classification and percentage of non-White residents; whereas the comparable figure for foreign-born persons was 80% higher (IRR = 1.78; 95%CI: 1.66 to 1.91). Conclusions Socio-economic deprivation continues to play a substantial role in sustaining the TB epidemic in England, especially in the UK-born population. This supports the case for further investigations of the underlying social- determinants of TB.

Our objective was to compare the changes of CD rates at our institution between the years 2008-2010 and 2017-2019 using the Robson ten group classification system. Study design Data was collected retrospectively and all women were classified using the obstetric concepts and parameters described in the Robson ten group classification system. Results During 2008-2010 7,832 deliveries were performed, increasing to 9,490 in 2017-2019. The CD rate also increased from 29.1% to 32.2% (p<.05) during this 10 year period. In both observed periods group 5 (single cephalic multiparous women at term with a previous CD) was the largest contributor to the overall CD rate accounting for 20.2% of all CD during 2008-2010 and increasing to 26.9% in 2017-2019 (p<.001). The overall size of group 5 also increased from 8.3% to 11.6% (p<.001). Furthermore, an increase in CD rate in group 7 (multiparous women with a single breech pregnancy, including women with a uterine scar) from 92.9% to 98.2% (p = .752) could be observed. In group 8 (women with multiple pregnancies, including women with a uterine scar) a slight shift towards vaginal delivery (VD) can be reported with CD rates decreasing from 82% to 79.2% (p = .784). There was no observed difference with CD rates in group 1 although the group size decreased from 29.4% in 2008-2010 to 24.2% in 2017-2019 (p<.001). The CD rate in group 10 experienced a slight elevation, in 2008-2010 46.2% were delivered per CD and in 2017-2019 48.8% (p = .553). The overall size of group 10 decreased, contributing 8.9% in 2008-2010 and 8% in 2017-2019 (p<.05) to the overall birthrate. Conclusion The biggest contributors to the CD rate in our hospital remain multiparous women at term with a previous CD. The CD rates, as well as the overall size of this group, keep rising, resulting in a need to establish more effective ways to motivate women with one previous CD towards vaginal birth after caesarean delivery (VBAC). Furthermore, the CD rate in preterm deliveries is increasing and approaching 50%. This illustrates the need to discuss whether CD is the appropriate mode of delivery in half of the preterm infants.

Brazilian Natl Canc Inst COVID-19	Cancer inpatients with COVID-19: A report from the Brazilian National Cancer Institute	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Objective This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of cancer inpatients with COVID-19 exploring clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. Results The mean age was 55.3 years (SD +/- 21.1). Comorbidities were present in 110 (60.8%) cases. The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. Metastatic disease accounted for 90 (49.7%) cases. In total, 63 (34.8%) had recently received cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7% (52 out of 138 patients) and for hematological malignancies, 23.5% (8 out of 34). According to the univariate analysis COVID-19-specific mortality was significantly associated with age over 75 years (P = .002), metastatic cancer (p <0.001), two or more sites of metastases (P < .001), the presence of lung (P < .001) or bone metastases (P = .001), non-curative treatment or best supportive care intent (P < .001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P = .002), admission due to COVID-19 (P = .009), and antibiotics use (P = .02). After multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms of COVID-19 (P = .027) and with two or more metastatic sites (P < .001) showed a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death. Conclusion This is the first Brazilian cohort of cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high.	[de Melo, Andreia C.; Thuler, Luiz C.

J	Hennein, R; Lowe, S				Hennein, Rachel; Lowe, Sarah			A hybrid inductive-abductive analysis of health workers' experiences and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESPIRATORY SYNDROME-CORONAVIRUS; LOW-INCOME MOTHERS; POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH; CARE WORKERS; MENTAL-HEALTH; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; DISORDER; STRESS; IMPACT	The COVID-19 pandemic puts health workers at increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes. However, no studies have assessed health workers' experiences using qualitative methods during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States to identify novel factors that could relate to their mental health. In May 2020, we distributed an online survey to health workers across 25 medical centers throughout the United States. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise and associated cutoff values were used to assess rates of probable major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol use disorder, respectively. To provide insight into the factors shaping these and other mental health conditions, we included two open-ended questions asking respondents to recount their most upsetting and hopeful experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it made them feel. Using a hybrid inductive-abductive approach and thematic content analysis, we created a Social Ecological Model to represent themes among health workers' experiences within five ecological levels: individual, interpersonal, organization, community, and public policy. Of the 1,132 participants who completed the survey, 14.0% had probable major depression, 15.8% probable generalized anxiety disorder, 23.1% probable post-traumatic stress disorder, and 42.6% probable alcohol use disorder. Individual level themes included participants' personal health and self-care behaviors. Interpersonal level themes included the health of their social circle, family functioning, and social support. Organization level themes included their hospital's management, resources, patient care, routine, and teams. Themes in the community level included the media, scientific knowledge about COVID-19, morale, behavior, and support of health workers. Lastly, government and health system leadership and shelter-in-place policy were themes within the public policy level. Our findings provide insights into novel factors that have impacted health workers' wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors should be further explored to inform interventions and public policy that mitigate mental health morbidities among health workers during this and future outbreaks.

However, the recent status of purchasing non-prescribed CHM and the associated factors are not completely understood. We aimed to report the prevalence of purchasing CHM and associated factors. Methods Using data from the 2017 Taiwan Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, we identified 16,528 individuals (householders) aged 18 years and older. Sociodemographic factors, expenditures on medical services and health behaviours were compared between people with and without a history of purchasing non-prescribed CHM by calculating adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Results The one-year prevalence of purchasing non-prescribed CHM was 74.8% in Taiwan. In addition to sociodemographics, marital status (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.88-2.44), the use of traditional Chinese medicine (OR 3.62, 95% CI 3.30-3.97), the purchasing of non-prescribed biochemical medications (OR 3.09, 95% CI 2.75-3.48), the purchasing of health foods (OR 2.59, 95% CI 2.33-2.86), the use of folk therapy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.95-2.64), and a high level of expenditure on alcohol (OR 3.79, 95% CI 3.29-4.36) were strongly correlated with purchasing non-prescribed CHM. Conclusion The one-year prevalence of purchasing non-prescribed CHM is very high in Taiwan and is correlated with sociodemographics, health behaviours, and the utilization of medical care. The interaction of non-prescribed CHM with physician-prescribed herbal medicine and biomedical medications requires more attention.

J	Samarth, DP; Kwon, YM				Samarth, Deepti Pranay; Kwon, Young Min			Horizontal genetic exchange of chromosomally encoded markers between Campylobacter jejuni cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NATURAL TRANSFORMATION; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; NEISSERIA-GONORRHOEAE; IV SECRETION; TETRACYCLINE RESISTANCE; EXTRACELLULAR DNA; FLAGELLIN LOCUS; FREE-RANGE; DIVERSITY; RECOMBINATION	Many epidemiological studies provide us with the evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) contributing to the bacterial genomic diversity that benefits the bacterial populations with increased ability to adapt to the dynamic environments. Campylobacter jejuni, a major cause of acute enteritis in the U.S., often linked with severe post-infection neuropathies, has been reported to exhibit a non-clonal population structure and comparatively higher strain-level genetic variation. In this study, we provide evidence of the HGT of chromosomally encoded genetic markers between C. jejuni cells in the biphasic MH medium. We used two C. jejuni NCTC-11168 mutants harbouring distinct antibiotic-resistance genes [chloramphenicol (Cm) and kanamycin (Km)] present at two different neutral genomic loci. Cultures of both marker strains were mixed together and incubated for 5 hrs, then plated on MH agar plates supplemented with both antibiotics. The recombinant cells with double antibiotic markers were generated at the frequency of 0.02811 +/- 0.0035% of the parental strains. PCR assays using locus-specific primers confirmed that transfer of the antibiotic-resistance genes was through homologous recombination. Also, the addition of chicken cecal content increased the recombination efficiency approximately up to 10-fold as compared to the biphasic MH medium (control) at P < 0.05. Furthermore, treating the co-culture with DNase I decreased the available DNA, which in turn significantly reduced recombination efficiency by 99.92% (P < 0.05). We used the cell-free supernatant of 16 hrs-culture of Wild-type C. jejuni as a template for PCR and found DNA sequences from six different genomic regions were easily amplified, indicating the presence of released chromosomal DNA in the culture supernatant. Our findings suggest that HGT in C. jejuni is facilitated in the chicken gut environment contributing to in vivo genomic diversity. Additionally, C. jejuni might have an active mechanism to release its chromosomal DNA into the extracellular environment, further expediting HGT in C. jejuni populations.

J	Tian, J; Zhang, CT; Wang, Q				Tian, Jie; Zhang, Chuntao; Wang, Qun			Analysis of craniocerebral injury in facial collision accidents	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOGIT MODEL; SEVERITY; HEAD; IMPACT	Considering that the Pc-Crash multibody dynamics software can reproduce the accident process accurately and obtain the collision parameters of pedestrian heads at the moment of head landing, the finite element analysis method can accurately analyze the injury of the pedestrian head when the boundary conditions are known. This paper combines the accident reconstruction method with the finite element analysis method to study the injury mechanism of pedestrian head impact on the ground in vehicle pedestrian collision accidents to provide a theoretical basis for pedestrian protection and the improvement of vehicle shapes. First, a real-life vehicle pedestrian collision is reproduced by Pc-Crash. The simulation results show that the rigid multibody model can accurately simulate the scene of the accident, then the speed and angle of the pedestrian head landing moment can be obtained at the same time. Second, the finite element model of human heads with a detailed facial structure is established and verified. Finally, the collision parameters obtained from the accident reconstruction are used as the boundary conditions to analyze the collision between the pedestrian head and the ground, and the biomechanical parameters, such as intracranial pressure, von Mises stress, shear stress and strain, can be determined. The results show that the stress wave will propagate inside and outside the skull and cause stress concentration in the skull and the brain tissue to varying degrees after the pedestrian head strikes the ground. When the stress exceeds a certain limit, it will cause different degrees of brain tissue injury.

Hence, continuous surveillance data is required before or after patient discharge from health institutions though such data is scarce in developing countries. Similarly, ongoing infection surveillance data are not available in Ethiopia. However, various primary studies conducted in the country showed different magnitude and determinants of healthcare-associated infection from 1983 to 2017. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the national pooled prevalence and determinants of healthcare-associated infection in Ethiopia. Methods We searched PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and grey literature deposited at Addis Ababa University online repository. The quality of studies was checked using Joanna Brigg's Institute quality assessment scale. Then, the funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to assess publication bias. The pooled prevalence of healthcare-associated infection was estimated using a weighted-inverse random-effects model meta-analysis. Finally, the subgroup analysis was done to resolve the cause of statistical heterogeneity. Results A total of 19 studies that satisfy the quality assessment criteria were considered in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of healthcare-associated infection in Ethiopia as estimated from 18 studies was 16.96% (95% CI: 14.10%-19.82%). In the subgroup analysis, the highest prevalence of healthcare-associated infection was in the intensive care unit 25.8% (95% CI: 3.55%-40.06%) followed by pediatrics ward 24.16% (95% CI: 12.76%-35.57%), surgical ward 23.78% (95% CI: 18.87%-29.69%) and obstetrics ward 22.25% (95% CI: 19.71%-24.80%). The pooled effect of two or more studies in this meta-analysis also showed that patients who had surgical procedures (AOR = 3.37; 95% CI: 1.85-4.89) and underlying non-communicable disease (AOR = 2.81; 95% CI: 1.39-4.22) were at increased risk of healthcare-associated infection. Conclusions The nationwide prevalence of healthcare-associated infection has remained a problem of public health importance in Ethiopia. The highest prevalence was observed in intensive care units followed by the pediatric ward, surgical ward and obstetrics ward. Thus, policymakers and program officers should give due emphasis on healthcare-associated infection preventive strategies at all levels. Essentially, the existing infection prevention and control practices in Ethiopia should be strengthened with special emphasis for patients admitted to intensive care units. Moreover, patients who had surgical procedures and underlying non-communicable diseases should be given more due attention.

Forty-four voluntary participants were recruited in this study. They were randomly assigned to four practice groups based on i) with or without feedback (i.e., group 1, control, did not receive the feedback; group 2, 3 and 4 received an online feedback during practice) and ii) the specific trunk/horse coordination to target during practice (group 1, target coordination = 180 degrees (without feedback); group 2, target coordination = 0 degrees; group 3, target coordination = 90 degrees; group 4, target coordination = 180 degrees). All participants performed pre-, practice, post- and retention sessions. The pre-, post- and retention sessions consisted of four trials, with one trial corresponding to one specific target coordination to maintain between their own oscillations and the horse oscillations (spontaneous, 0 degrees, 90 degrees, and 180 degrees). The practice phase was composed of three different sessions during which participants received an online feedback about the coordination between their own oscillations and the horse oscillations. Results showed a significant change with practice in the trunk/horse coordination patterns which persisted even after one month (retention-test). However, all the groups did not show the same nature of change, evidenced by a high postural variability during post-test for 0 degrees and 90 degrees target coordination groups, in opposition to the 180 degrees and spontaneous groups who showed a decrease in coordination variability for the 180 degrees group. The coordination in anti-phase was characterized as spontaneously adopted by participants on the mechanical horse, explaining the ease of performing this coordination (compared to the 0 degrees and 90 degrees target coordination). The effect of online visual feedback appeared not only on the coordination pattern itself, but most importantly on its variability during practice, including concerning initially stable coordination patterns.

The absence of a flow signal in OCTA in polyps revealed by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) may indicate slow or compromised filling of blood flow from choroidal vessels. Naive patients with PCV treated with intravitreal injections of aflibercept (IVI-A) were enrolled in this study to validate the hypothesis that baseline flow may affect the outcome of polyp regression in ICGA. The flow signal of polyps in OCTA was detected by manual segmentation in the corresponding location by ICGA. Polyps were defined as high-flow if both OCTA and ICGA showed positive findings, and low-flow if OCTA showed a negative flow signal in 3 consecutive horizontal scans at the polyp area shown in ICGA. A total of 24 polyps were identified in 13 PCV patients at baseline. Of these 24 polyps, 22 (91.7%) were high-flow and 2 (8.3%) were low-flow. After 3 monthly IVI-A, all low-flow polyps had complete regression in ICGA. Among 17 (77%) high-flow polyps at baseline that had regression after treatment, 10 (58.8%) became low-flow, while 5 (22.7%) persistent polyps remained high-flow. Flow signal of polyps as detected by OCTA could be a predictive factor for treatment response in patients with PCV. Monitoring changes in flow signal after treatment is clinically relevant.

J	Choi, J; Kim, S; Cho, T				Choi, Jiyoun; Kim, Sahyang; Cho, Taehong			An apparent-time study of an ongoing sound change in Seoul Korean: A prosodic account	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VOICE ONSET TIME; SEGMENTAL FOCUS; LEXICAL FOCUS; IMPLEMENTATION; CONTRAST; ENGLISH; STRESS; STOPS; TONOGENESIS; PERCEPTION	In present-day Seoul Korean, the primary phonetic feature for the lenis-aspirated stop distinction is shifting from VOT to F0. Some previous studies have considered this sound change to be a tonogenesis, whereby the low-level F0 perturbation has developed into tonal features (L for the lenis and H for the aspirated) in the segmental phonology. They, however, have examined the stop distinction only at a phrase- or utterance-initial position. We newly explore the sound change in relation to various prosodic structural factors (position and prominence). Apparent-time production data were recorded from four speaker groups: young female, young male, old female, old male. The way the speakers use VOT versus F0 indeed varies as a function of position and prominence. Crucially, in all groups, VOT is still used for the lenis-aspirated distinction phrase-medially due to the lenis stop voicing. This role of VOT, however, is found only in the non-prominent (unfocused) condition, in which the F0 difference is reduced to a low-level perturbation effect. In the prominent (focused) context in which tones come into play, the role of VOT diminishes, led by young female speakers. These can be interpreted as a prosodically-conditioned, complementary use of the features to maintain sufficient contrast. Importantly, however, the tonal difference under focus is not bidirectionally polarized, so that F0 is not lowered for the lenis stop. A lack of direct enhancement of the distinctive L tone weakens a possibility that F0 is transphonologized to the phonemic feature system of the language. As an alternative to the view that tonal features are newly introduced in the segmental phonology, we propose a prosodic account: the sound change is best characterized as a prosodically-conditioned change in the use of the segmental voicing feature (implemented by VOT) versus already available post-lexical tones in the intonational phonology of Korean.

J	Hong, JW; Noh, JH; Kim, DJ				Hong, Jae Won; Noh, Jung Hyun; Kim, Dong-Jun			Association between serum uric acid and spirometric pulmonary function in Korean adults: The 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK; MORTALITY; DISEASE; HYPERURICEMIA; POPULATION	Background A limited number of epidemiological studies have investigated the association between serum uric acid and pulmonary function in the general population. However, the results have been inconclusive. Objectives This study was performed to investigate the association between serum uric acid and spirometric pulmonary function in general population. Methods Among the 8,150 participants who participated in the 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2,901 participants were analyzed in this study. Subjects were divided into four groups according to forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted quartiles. Participants in the lowest quartile of FVC % predicted and FEV1% predicted were compared to those in the remaining quartiles according to age, education level, household income, smoking status, alcohol consumption, aerobic exercise, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, renal impairment, serum uric acid, and hyperuricemia. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of hyperuricemia for participants in the lowest quartile of FVC% and FEV1 predicted, with above covariates. Results In women, hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FVC% predicted (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.06-2.75,p= 0.027) and FEV1 predicted (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.06-2.74,p= 0.028) respectively, serving as above confounding variables. In men, hyperuricemia (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.22,p= 0.021) was associated with the lowest quartile of FEV1% predicted, not FVC% predicted. According to median age, in women, age >= 56 years old with hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FVC% predicted (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.04-3.28,p= 0.037) and FEV1% predicted (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.11-3.75,p= 0.021), respectively. In men, age >= 56 years old with hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FEV1% predicted (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.05-2.94,p= 0.033), not FCV% predicted. Conclusions Hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FEV1% or FVC% predicted in Korean general population.

Mapping awareness of breast and cervical cancer risk factors, symptoms and lay beliefs in Uganda and South Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE; POPULATION; INTERVALS; STAGE; HIV	Background Breast and cervical cancer are leading causes of cancer burden in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We measured breast and cervical cancer symptom and risk factor awareness and lay beliefs in Uganda and South Africa (SA). Methods Between August and December 2018 we conducted a cross-sectional survey of women >= 18 years in one urban and one rural site per country. Households were selected using systematic random sampling, then one woman per household randomly selected to participate. Data were collected by interviewers using electronic tablets customised with the locally validated African Women Awareness of Cancer (AWACAN) tool. This has unprompted questions (testing recall) followed by prompted questions (testing recognition) on risk factor, symptom awareness and lay beliefs for breast and cervical cancer. Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare the association between socio-demographic variables and outcomes. Poisson regression with robust variance was conducted to identify independent socio-demographic predictors. Results Of the 1758 women interviewed, 90.8% had heard of breast and 89.4% of cervical cancer. 8.7% recalled at least one breast risk factor and 38.1% recalled at least one cervical cancer risk factor. 78.0% and 57.7% recalled at least one breast/cervical cancer symptom respectively. Recognition of risk factors and symptoms was higher than recall. Many women were unaware that HPV, HIV, and not being screened were cervical cancer risk factors (23.7%, 46.8%, 26.5% respectively). In SA, urban compared to rural women had significantly higher symptom and risk factor awareness for both cancers. In Uganda married women/living with a partner had higher awareness of breast cancer risk factors and cervical cancer symptoms compared to women not living with a partner. Women mentioned several lay beliefs (e.g. putting money in their bra as a breast cancer risk factor). Conclusion We identified gaps in breast and cervical cancer symptom and risk factor awareness. Our results provide direction for locally targeted cancer awareness intervention programs and serve as a baseline measure against which to evaluate interventions in SSA.

It was reported that rumors were hampering the response effort. We sought to identify any rumors that could have influenced outbreak containment and affected prevention in unaffected areas of DR Congo. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in DR Congo over a period of 2 months (from August 1 to September 30, 2019) using in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). The participants were recruited from five regional blocks using purposeful sampling. Both areas currently undergoing outbreaks and presently unaffected areas were included. We collected participants' opinions, views, and beliefs about the Ebola virus. The IDIs (n = 60) were performed with key influencers (schoolteachers, religious and political leaders/analysts, and Ebola-frontline workers), following a semi-structured interview guide. FGDs (n = 10) were conducted with community members. Interviews were recorded with a digital voice recorder and simultaneous note-taking. Participant responses were categorized in terms of their themes and subthemes. Results We identified 3 high-level themes and 15 subthemes (given here in parentheses): (1) inadequate knowledge of the origin or cause of Ebola (belief in a metaphysical origin, insufficient awareness of Ebola transmission via an infected corpse, interpretation of disease as God's punishment, belief in nosocomial Ebola, poor hygiene, and bathing in the Congo River). Ebola was interpreted as (2) a plot by multinational corporations (fears of genocide, Ebola understood as a biological weapon, concerns over organ trafficking, and Ebola was taken to be the result of business actions). Finally Ebola was rumored to be subject to (3) politicization (political authorities seen as ambivalent, exclusion of some community leaders from response efforts, distrust of political authorities, and distrust in the healthcare system). Conclusions Due to the skepticism against Ebola countermeasures, it is critical to understand widespread beliefs about the disease to implement actions that will be effective, including integrating response with the unmet needs of the population.

To date, no structured grading system has been developed to evaluate labral tears in these patients. The present study describes a new system of grading labral tears in patients with acetabular dysplasia. Methods The data of 66 patients who underwent hip arthroscopy for symptomatic hip dysplasia from March 2014 to February 2018 were reviewed. Labral tears were classified into four groups, based on the occurrence of chondrolabral junction (CLJ) disruption, capsulolabral recess (CLR) disruption, and labral displacement. Labral tears without instability were classified as grade 1 or 2. Partial delamination or blistering of the labrum with minimal fraying at the CLJ was classified as grade 1, whereas labral tears with CLJ disruption were classified as grade 2. Unstable labral tears with CLR disruption followed by CLJ disruption, but without labral displacement, were classified as grade 3, whereas unstable labral tears with CLR and CLJ disruption, but with labral displacement, were classified as grade 4. The radiological and clinical characteristics of patients in each grade were determined including by simple radiographs and MRI/MR arthrography, as were concomitant findings, including rupture of the ligamentum teres, articular cartilage damage, and presence of a paralabral cyst. The surgical options selected for each grade and clinical outcomes, including modified Harris hip scores (mHHS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) scores, were evaluated. Spearman's correlation analyses were performed to assess whether labral tear grade correlated with baseline characteristics, the incidence of concomitant injuries, and the severity of osteoarthritis (OA). The Wilcoxon test for paired data was performed to compare treatment results with pain scores. Results The study cohort included six men and 53 women of mean +/- SD age 39.9 +/- 13.0 years (range, 15-66 years). Of the 66 hips, seven (10.6%), 10 (15.2%), 30 (45.5%), and 19 (28.8%) were classified as grades 1-4, respectively. Symptom duration (P= 0.017), preoperative Tonnis OA grade (P< 0.001), cartilage damage (P< 0.001), and the presence of a paralabral cyst (P= 0.001) correlated significantly with baseline tear grade. In all groups, mHHS and WOMAC scores improved after surgical treatment. Conclusions Arthroscopic findings of labral tears in patients with hip dysplasia differed from the conventional classification. The classification system proposed in this study will likely be useful for determining the degree of labral tear in patients with hip dysplasia and for predicting treatment outcomes.

We investigated the prevalence and associated factors of childbearing desire in HIV-infected women in care in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and explored whether such desires were translated into behaviors related to contraceptive use and communication with health personnel. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two HIV-care facilities in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire in 2015. Eligible women were non-pregnant, non-menopausal, aged 18-49 years and diagnosed as HIV-infected. The outcomes were childbearing desire, prevalence of modern contraceptive use, unmet needs for family planning and intention of the last pregnancy since HIV diagnosis. Women wishing to conceive immediately were asked whether they had discussed their desire with HIV healthcare workers. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between the outcomes and women's characteristics. Results Of 1,631 women, 80% declared having childbearing desire. No association was found between women's childbearing desire and ART status or its duration. In multivariate models, younger age, being in a stable relationship and having no or only one child were significantly associated with increased childbearing desire. Of the women wishing to conceive immediately (n = 713), only 43% reported having had fertility-related dialogue with healthcare provider. Among sexually active women wanting to avoid or delay pregnancy (n = 650), unmet needs for family planning was 40%. Regarding the last pregnancy since HIV diagnosis, one in three women reported not having wanted a baby at that time. Conclusions Pregnancy desire in women living with HIV in Abidjan was extremely high. Integration of safe conception strategies as well as improvement of contraceptive uptake among women in need of family planning are of utmost importance to ensure optimal conception and to avoid transmission of HIV to the male partner or to the forthcoming child.

Impact of diagnostic uncertainty in mass testing on the spread of COVID-19	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS; WUHAN; CHINA	Testing is viewed as a critical aspect of any strategy to tackle epidemics. Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus.

Results from a simulated scenario study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IN-VITRO EVALUATION; ACCURACY; QUANTIFICATION; SYSTEM	Background The intraoperative blood loss is estimated daily in the operating room and is mainly done by visual techniques. Due to local standards, the surgical sponge colours can vary (e.g. white in US, green in Germany). The influence of sponge colour on accuracy of estimation has not been in the focus of research yet. Material and methods A blood loss simulation study containing four "bleeding" scenarios each per sponge colour were created by using expired whole blood donation samples. The blood donations were applied to white and green surgical sponges after dilution with full electrolyte solution. Study participants had to estimate the absorbed blood loss in sponges in all scenarios. The difference to the reference blood loss was analysed. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate other influence factors such as staff experience and sponge colour. Results A total of 53 anaesthesists participated in the study. Visual estimation correlated moderately with reference blood loss in white (Spearman's rho: 0.521; p = 3.748*10(-16)) and green sponges (Spearman's rho: 0.452; p = 4.683*10(-12)). The median visually estimated blood loss was higher in white sponges (250ml IRQ 150-412.5ml) than in green sponges (150ml IQR 100-300ml), compared to reference blood loss (103ml IQR 86-162.8). For both colour types of sponges, major under- and overestimation was observed. The multivariate statistics demonstrates that fabric colours have a significant influence on estimation (p = 3.04*10(-10)), as well as clinician's qualification level (p = 2.20*10(-10), p = 1.54*10(-08)) and amount of RBL to be estimated (p < 2*10(-16)). Conclusion The deviation of correct blood loss estimation was smaller with white surgical sponges compared to green sponges. In general, deviations were so severe for both types of sponges, that it appears to be advisable to refrain from visually estimating blood loss whenever possible and instead to use other techniques such as e.g. colorimetric estimation.

A major pleiotropic QTL identified for yield components and nitrogen content in rice (Oryza sativaL.) under differential nitrogen field conditions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE-TRAIT LOCI; INBRED LINE POPULATION; USE EFFICIENCY; GRAIN-YIELD; AGRONOMIC TRAITS; LEAF TRAITS; L.; SIZE; VALIDATION; DISSECTION	To identify the genomic regions for yield and NUE of rice genotypes and lines with promising yield under low N, a recombinant inbred population (RIL) developed between BPT5204 (a mega variety known for its quality) and PTB1 (variety with high NUE) was evaluated for consecutive wet and dry seasons under low nitrogen (LN) and recommended nitrogen (RN) field conditions. A set of 291 RILs were characterized for 24 traits related to leaf, agro-morphological, yield, N content and nitrogen use efficiency indices. More than 50 RILs were found promising with grain yield >10 g under LN. Parental polymorphism survey with 297 SSRs and selective genotyping revealed five genomic regions associated with yield under LN, which were further saturated with polymorphic SSRs. Thirteen promising SSRs were identified out of 144 marker trait associations under LN using single marker analysis. Composite interval mapping showed 37 QTL under LN with five pleiotropic QTL. A major stable pleiotropic (RM13201-RM13209) from PTB1 spanning 825.4 kb region associated with straw N % (SNP) in both treatments across seasons and yield and yield related traits in WS appears to be promising for the MAS. Another major QTL (RM13181-RM13201) was found to be associated with only relative trait parameters of biomass, grain and grain nitrogen. These two major pleiotropic QTL (RM13201-RM13209 and RM13181-RM13201) on chromosome 2 were characterized for their positive allele effect and could be deployed for the development of rice varieties with NUE.

While numerous studies have shown an increasing prevalence of myopia worldwide, there continues to be uncertainty about the magnitude of myopia in Indian school going population. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We systematically identified published literature of last four decades from 1980 to March 2020 and assessed them for methodological quality. Data were gathered into 5-year age groups from 5-15, in urban or rural populations, and standardized to definition of myopia as refractive error >= -0.50 dioptre. Random effects meta-analysis was done. Results We included data from 59 quality assessed studies, covering nearly 1,66,000 urban and 1,20,000 rural children. The overall crude prevalence of myopia over last four decades is 7.5% (95% CI, 6.5-8.5%) in 5-15-year age group. The prevalence of myopia is 8.5% (95% CI, 7.1-9.9%) in urban and 6.1% (95% CI, 4.5-7.7%) in rural children, with highest prevalence in urban 11-15-year age group [15.0% in last decade]. A significant increment in prevalence is noted in the last decade in rural children from 4.6% to 6.8%, reflecting changing rural environment. Conclusion Myopia is an emerging public health problem in both urban and rural school going adolescents in India requiring urgent efforts.

J	Wagner, J; Chen, WH; Vrdoljak, G				Wagner, Jeff; Chen, Wenhao; Vrdoljak, Gordon			Vaping cartridge heating element compositions and evidence of high temperatures	PLOS ONE			English	Article							E-CIGARETTES; MECHANISMS	Background Identifying the functional materials inside vaping devices can help inform efforts to understand risk. While nicotine E-cigarette components and metals have been characterized in several previous studies, the internal component compositions of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cartridge designs are not as well known. The 2019-20 e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) outbreak has been associated with THC devices containing vitamin E acetate (VEA), possibly mediated by chemical reactions with internal cartridge components and high filament temperatures. Methods We investigate the composition and internal components of 2019 EVALI patient-associated THC vaping devices compared to other THC and nicotine devices from 2016-19, specifically the metal, ceramic, and polymer components likely to be exposed to heat. To do this, we have disassembled forty-eight components from eight used and unused vaping devices under a microscope and analyzed them using X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared micro-spectroscopy. Conclusions The two THC cartridges used by EVALI patients exhibited evidence of localized high temperatures, including charring of the ceramic heating elements and damaged wire surfaces. The newer THC cartridges possessed more ceramic and polymer insulation than older THC or nicotine devices. The combination of ceramics, metals, and high temperatures in newer THC cartridges is consistent with conditions hypothesized to produce VEA reactions during vaping. Nickel and chromium components were detected in all devices, and others contained copper, lead, tin, gold, silicon-rich rubbers, or fluorinated microplastics. These components have the potential to thermally degrade and volatilize if heated sufficiently. These findings do not imply that harmful exposures would occur under all usage conditions, and are most relevant to harm reduction efforts based on avoiding higher internal temperatures. This study was limited to a small sample of cartridges obtained from investigations. Future work should test more device types and internal temperatures under controlled usage conditions.

In recent years administrative databases have been increasingly used to predict health outcomes. In 1992, Von Korff proposed a Chronic Disease Score (CDS) to predict 1-year mortality by only using drug prescription data. Because pharmacotherapy underwent many changes over the last 3 decades, the original version of the CDS has limitations. The aim of this paper is to report on the development of the modified version of the CDS. Methods The modified CDS (M-CDS) was developed using 33 variables (from drug prescriptions within two-year before 01/01/2018) to predict one-year mortality in Bologna residents aged >= 50 years. The population was split into training and testing sets for internal validation. Score weights were estimated in the training set using Cox regression model with LASSO procedure for variables selection. The external validation was carried out on the Imola population. The predictive ability of M-CDS was assessed using ROC analysis and compared with that of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), that is based on hospital data only, and of the Multisource Comorbidity Score (MCS), which uses hospital and pharmaceutical data. Results The predictive ability of M-CDS was similar in the training and testing sets (AUC 95% CI: training [0.760-0.770] vs. testing [0.750-0.772]) and in the external population (Imola AUC 95% CI [0.756-0.781]). M-CDS was significantly better than CCI (M-CDS AUC = 0.761, 95% CI [0.750-0.772] vs. CCI-AUC = 0.696, 95% CI [0.681-0.711]). No significant difference was found between M-CDS and MCS (MCS AUC = 0.762, 95% CI [0.749-0.775]). Conclusions M-CDS, using only drug prescriptions, has a better performance than the CCI score in predicting 1-year mortality, and is not inferior to the multisource comorbidity score. M-CDS can be used for population risk stratification, for risk-adjustment in association studies and to predict the individual risk of death.

So far there is no consensus for drug treatment to stop the spread of the virus. Discovery of a drug that would limit the virus expansion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the humanity in the last decades. In this perspective, to test existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a good approach. Among natural phenolic compounds found in plants, fruit, and vegetables; flavonoids are the most abundant. Flavonoids, especially in their glycosylated forms, display a number of physiological activities, which makes them interesting to investigate as antiviral molecules. The flavonoids chemical structures were downloaded from PubChem and protease structure 6LU7 was from the Protein Data Bank site. Molecular docking study was performed using AutoDock Vina. Among the tested moleculesshowed the highest binding affinity (-9,7 kcal/mol). Docking studies showed that glycosylated flavonoids are good inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 protease and could be further investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments for further validation. MD simulations were further performed to evaluate the dynamic behavior and stability of the protein in complex with the three best hits of docking experiments. Our results indicate that the rutin is a potential drug to inhibit the function of Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro) of Coronavirus.

J	Cunha, EN; de Souza, MFB; Lanza, DCF; Lima, JPMS				Cunha, Eduardo Nogueira; de Souza, Maria Fernanda Bezerra; Lanza, Daniel Carlos Ferreira; Lima, Joao Paulo Matos Santos			A low-cost smart system for electrophoresis-based nucleic acids detection at the visible spectrum	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ETHIDIUM-BROMIDE; MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS; AGAROSE GELS; SYBR GOLD; DNA; DECONTAMINATION; FLUORESCENCE	Nucleic acid detection by electrophoresis is still a quick and accessible technique for many diagnosis methods, primarily at research laboratories or at the point of care units. Standard protocols detect DNA/RNA molecules through specific bound chemical dyes using a UV-transilluminator or UV-photo documentation system. However, the acquisition costs and availability of these devices, mainly the ones with photography and internet connection capabilities, can be prohibitive, especially in developing countries public health units. Also, ultraviolet radiation is a common additional risk factor to professionals that use electrophoresis-based nucleic acid detection. With that in mind, this work describes the development of a low-cost DNA/RNA detection smart system capable of obtaining qualitative and semi-quantitative data from gel analysis. The proposed device explores the visible light absorption range of commonly used DNA/RNA dyes using readily available parts, and simple manufacturing processes, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and 3D impression. By applying IoT techniques, our system covers a wide range of color spectrum in order to detect bands from various commercially used dyes, using Bluetooth communication and a smartphone for hardware control, image capturing, and sharing. The project also enables process scalability and has low manufacturing and maintenance costs. The use of LEDs at the visible spectrum can achieve very reproducible images, providing a high potential for rapid and point-of-care diagnostics as well as applications in several fields such as healthcare, agriculture, and aquaculture.

The study assessed the utility of "Household contact card and register" for screening of HHC of pulmonary TB (PTB) patients for TB and explored the reasons for HHC not being screened and followed-up. Methods The "Household contact card and register" was implemented by the Health Care Workers (HCW) of the TB Control Programme in Chennai District for screening HHC of index PTB patients initiated on treatment between June and August, 2018. Contacts were required to be screened within 2 months of treatment initiation of the index patient. Details collected included age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, immunosuppressive conditions and TB treatment. Symptom screening along with chest radiograph and or sputum examination was attempted. Follow-up TB screening at 6 and 12 months were performed. Screening of HHC was compared pre and post implementation phase. Proportions were computed for the data analysed. Results HHC information was documented for 93% (1268/1364) of Index PTB patients. The main reasons of non-listing of HHC in 96 PTB patients were HCW non-availability or non-co-operation of the HHC. There were 2150 (80%) contacts who were screened for TB. Inconvenient time, feeling healthy, stigma, out-station visit were the main reasons for 537 contacts not undergoing TB screening. Anti-TB treatment was initiated in 21 (1%) of contacts diagnosed with TB. Preventive therapy was initiated in 59% (81/138) of contacts aged Conclusion "Household contact card and register" is a useful tool for HCWs for TB screening in HHC of PTB patients. Reasons for non-adherence to contact screening needs to be addressed.

We develop a Bayesian shrinkage approach to quantile mixed regression models using a Bayesian adaptive lasso and an extended Bayesian adaptive group lasso. We also consider variable selection procedures for both fixed and random effects in a linear quantile mixed model via the Bayesian adaptive lasso and extended Bayesian adaptive group lasso with spike and slab priors. To improve mixing of the Markov chains, a simple and efficient partially collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed for posterior inference.

J	Alcala Herrera, R; Sierra, MLF; Ruano, F				Alcala Herrera, Rafael; Fernandez Sierra, Maria Luisa; Ruano, Francisca			The suitability of native flowers as pollen sources for Chrysoperla lucasina (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LACEWINGS NEUROPTERA; CROP ENVIRONMENT; FOOD; CARNEA; PREDATORS; LANDSCAPE; PLANTS; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION	Green lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) are key biological control agents found in a broad range of crops. Given the importance of enhancing their presence and conservation, in this study, we aim to identify and to determine the relative importance of the pollen consumed by Chrysoperla lucasina (Lacroix, 1936) from 29 pollen types offered by 51 native plant species sown in an experimental farm in Villarrubia in the south of Spain. For the purposes of this study, C. lucasina specimens were captured in the late spring of 2016 and 2017. The pollen types and other components in the alimentary canal of C. lucasina were microscopically identified using the transparency method, which is a novel technique applied to green lacewings captured in the field. The results show that (i) C. lucasina feeds on over half of the pollen types offered by the sown plant species, with no differences in behaviour by sex or year; (ii) Capsella bursa-pastoris was the most frequently identified pollen type in the alimentary canal; (iii) the majority of pollen types identified correspond to sown native plant species and not to surrounding plant species; and that (iv) most of the adults studied also consumed honeydew. Our feeding study has important implications for the selection of plant mixtures for ground cover restoration and flower vegetation strips in Mediterranean agroecosystems, which complements our previous findings on how C. lucasina use native plant species as host and reproduction sites. The plant species Capsella bursa-pastoris and Biscutella auriculata, which are best suited to provide pollen, host and reproduction sites for C. lucasina in late spring, should consequently be included in the proposed plant mixtures for Mediterranean agroecosystems.

The effect of metacognitive training on confidence and strategic reminder setting	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; AWARENESS; ACCOUNT; TASK	Individuals often choose between remembering information using their own memory ability versus using external resources to reduce cognitive demand (i.e. 'cognitive offloading'). For example, to remember a future appointment an individual could choose to set a smartphone reminder or depend on their unaided memory ability. Previous studies investigating strategic reminder setting found that participants set more reminders than would be optimal, and this bias towards reminder-setting was predicted by metacognitive underconfidence in unaided memory ability. Due to the link between underconfidence in memory ability and excessive reminder setting, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether metacognitive training is an effective intervention to a) improve metacognitive judgment accuracy, and b) reduce bias in strategic offloading behaviour. Participants either received metacognitive training which involved making performance predictions and receiving feedback on judgment accuracy, or were part of a control group. As predicted, metacognitive training increased judgment accuracy: participants in the control group were significantly underconfident in their memory ability, whereas the experimental group showed no significant metacognitive bias. However, contrary to predictions, both experimental and control groups were significantly biased toward reminder-setting, and did not differ significantly. Therefore, reducing metacognitive bias was not sufficient to eliminate the bias towards reminders. We suggest that the reminder bias likely results in part from erroneous metacognitive evaluations, but that other factors such as a preference to avoid cognitive effort may also be relevant. Finding interventions to mitigate these factors could improve the adaptive use of external resources.

The aim of current study is evaluating the prevalence of underlying disease in died people with COVID-19. Methods The current study have been conducted according to PRISMA guideline. International database including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane and google scholar were searched for relevant studies up to 1 June. All relevant articles that reported underlying disease in died cases of COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Results After screening and excluding duplicated and irrelevant studies, 32 articles included in the analysis. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, lung disease, malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, COPD and asthma. Among all reported underlying disease, highest and lowest prevalence was related to hypertension and asthma which were estimated 46% (37% - 55%) and 3% (2%- 6%), respectively. Conclusion In summary, underlying disease have a critical role in poor outcomes, severity of disease and high mortality rate of COVID-19 cases.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE EXPENDITURES; SRI-LANKA EVIDENCE; LOW-INCOME; CHRONIC DISEASES; ESSENTIAL MEDICINES; BURDEN; IMPACT; AFFORDABILITY; AVAILABILITY; CONSUMPTION	In the global context, the health and quality of life of people are adversely affected by either one or more types of chronic diseases. The chronic pain associated with diagnosed patients may include heavy medical expenditure along with the physical and mental suffering they undergo. Usually, unbearable amounts of medical expenses are incurred, to improve or sustain the health condition of the patient. Consequently, the heavy financial burden tends to push households from a comfortable or secure life, or even from bad to worse, towards the probability of becoming poor. Hence, this study is conducted to identify the impact chronic illnesses have on poverty using data from a national survey referred as the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), with data gathered by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka in 2016. As such, this study is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, declaring the originality of the study based on data collected from the local arena. Accordingly, the study discovered that married females who do not engage in any type of economic activity, in the age category of 40-65, having an educational level of tertiary level or below and living in the urban sector have a higher likelihood of suffering from chronic diseases. Moreover, it was inferred that, if a person is deprived from access to basic education in the level of education, lives in the rural or estate sector, or suffers from a brain disease, cancer, heart disease or kidney disease, he is highly likely to be poor. Some insights concluded from this Sri Lankan case study can also be applied in the context of other developing countries, to minimise chronic illnesses and thereby the probability of falling into poverty.

However, the genomic basis of these unique traits associated with WHYC is poorly understood. In this study, whole-genome resequencing was performed with an average coverage of 20.77-fold to investigate heritable variation and identify selection signals in WHYC. Reads were mapped onto the chicken reference genome (Galgal5) with a coverage of 85.95%. After quality control, 11,953,471 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 1,069,574 insertion/deletions were obtained. In addition, 41,408 structural variants and 33,278 copy number variants were found. Comparative genomic analysis of WHYC and other yellow-feathered chicken breeds showed that selected regions were enriched in genes involved in transport and catabolism, immune system, infectious diseases, signal transduction, and signaling molecules and interactions. Several genes associated with disease resistance were also identified, including IFNA, IFNB, CD86, IL18, IL11RA, VEGFC, and ATG10. Furthermore, our results suggest that PMEL and TYRP1 may contribute to the white feather coloring in WHYC. These findings can improve our understanding of the genetic characteristics of WHYC and may contribute to future breed improvement.

Antigen-specific memory and naive CD4(+)T cells following secondaryChlamydia trachomatisinfection	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CD4 T-CELLS; MEDIATED PROTECTION; RNA-SEQ; INFECTION; RESPONSES; EFFECTOR; GENERATION; GENE	Memory antigen-specific CD4(+)T cells againstChlamydia trachomatisare necessary for protection against secondary genital tract infection. While it is known that naive antigen-specific CD4(+)T cells can traffic to the genital tract in an antigen-specific manner, these T cells are not protective during primary infection. Here, we sought to compare the differences between memory and naive antigen-specific CD4(+)T cells in the same mouse following secondary infection using transgenic CD4(+)T cells (NR1 T cells). Using RNA sequencing, we found that there were subtle but distinct differences between these two T cell populations. Naive NR1 T cells significantly upregulated cell cycle genes and were more proliferative than memory NR1 T cells in the draining lymph node. In contrast, memory NR1 T cells were more activated than naive NR1 T cells and were enriched in the genital tract. Together, our data provide insight into the differences between memory and naive antigen-specific CD4(+)T cells duringC.trachomatisinfection.

We aimed to assess the effect of socioeconomic factors on case fatality, health related quality of life (HRQoL), and satisfaction with care of stroke survivors in the framework of the European Health Care Outcomes, Performance and Efficiency (EuroHOPE) study in Hungary, one of the leading countries regarding stroke mortality. Methods We evaluated 200 consecutive patients admitted for first-ever ischemic stroke in a single center and performed a follow-up at 3 months after stroke. We recorded pre- and post-stroke socioeconomic factors, and assessed case fatality, HRQoL and patient satisfaction with the care received. Stroke severity at onset was scored by the National Institutes of Health Stroke scale (NIHSS), disability at discharge from acute care was evaluated by the modified Rankin Score (mRS). To evaluate HRQoL and patient satisfaction with care we used the EQ-5D-5L, 15D and EORTC IN PATSAT 32 questionnaires. Results At 3 months after stroke the odds of death was significantly increased by stroke severity (NIHSS, OR = 1.209, 95%CI: 1.125-1.299, p<0.001) and age (OR = 1.045, 95%CI: 1.003-1.089, p = 0.038). In a multiple linear regression model, independent predictors of HRQoL were age, disability at discharge, satisfaction with care, type of social dwelling after stroke, length of acute hospital stay and rehospitalization. Satisfaction with care was influenced negatively by stroke severity (Coef. = -1.111, 95%C.I.: -2.159- -0.062, p = 0.040), and positively by having had thrombolysis (Coef. = 25.635, 95%C.I.: 5.212-46.058, p = 0.016) and better HRQoL (Coef. = 22.858, 95%C.I.: 6.007-39.708, p = 0.009). Conclusion In addition to age, disability, and satisfaction with care, length of hospital stay and type of social dwelling after stroke also predicted HRQoL. Long-term outcome after stroke could be improved by reducing time spent in hospital, i.e. by developing home care rehabilitation facilities thus reducing the need for readmission to inpatient care.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 604 patients with HCC diagnosed between January 1999 and December 2015, and 288 patients without HCC who were seen at the National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center between October 2014 and November 2017. The association between serum kynurenine and prognosis was evaluated using the Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis. Results Patients with HCC had significantly higher values of serum kynurenine than patients without HCC (median: 557.1 vs. 464.2 ng/mL, p<0.001). Five-year survival rates of HCC patients with serum kynurenine >= 900 (n = 65), 600-899 (n = 194), and <600 ng/mL (n = 345) were 30.6%, 47.4%, and 61.4%, respectively (p = 0.001, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis identified serum kynurenine as an independent predictor for prognosis of HCC patients. The hazard ratio of serum kynurenine >= 900, and 600-899 compared with serum kynurenine <600 ng/mL were 1.91 (p<0.001) and 1.37 (p = 0.015), respectively. Conclusions A high level of serum kynurenine correlated with poor prognosis of HCC. Serum kynurenine levels may be a novel biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC. The development of drugs that inhibit kynurenine production is expected to help improve the prognosis of patients with HCC.

Numerous clinical studies have explored the promising therapeutic effects of organic germanium on cancer, arthritis and senile osteoporosis. The immune activation property of organic germanium is considered the foundation of its various therapeutic effects. However, previous human clinical studies investigating immune activation with organic germanium compounds have certain limitations, as some studies did not strictly follow a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. To build a more clinically substantiated foundation for the mechanism underlying its immunostimulation, we structured by far the most rigorous clinical study to-date with a group of 130 human subjects to examine changes in immune profiles following germanium supplementation. We used Bio-Germanium, an organic germanium compound naturally synthesizedviaa yeast fermentation process. An 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with 130 subjects with leukocyte counts of 4-8 (x10(3)/mu L) divided into the Bio-Germanium group and the placebo group. Anthropometric measurements; blood collection; biochemical analysis; urinalysis; and natural killer cell activity, cytokine and immunoglobulin assays were conducted. Results showed the Bio-Germanium group exhibited NK cell activity increases at effector cell:target cell (E:T) ratios of 50:1, 10:1, 5:1 and 2.5:1 (12.60 +/- 32.91%, 10.19 +/- 23.88%, 9.28 +/- 16.49% and 7.27 +/- 15.28%, respectively), but the placebo group showed decreases (P<0.01). The difference in the IgG1 change from baseline to follow-up between the Bio-Germanium and placebo groups was significant (P= 0.044). Our results and earlier clinical study of Bio-Germanium confirm that Bio-Germanium acts as an effective immunostimulant by increasing the cytotoxicity of NK cells and activating immunoglobulin, B cells and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (P<0.05). As we have added newly discovered clinical findings for germanium's immunostimulation mechanism, we believe Bio-Germanium is a highly promising therapeutic agent and should certainly be further explored for potential development opportunities in immunotherapy.

Human papillomavirus vaccination practices and perceptions among Ghanaian Healthcare Providers: A qualitative study based on multi-theory model	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HPV VACCINATION; RECOMMENDATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; BARRIERS; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; SERIES; GIRLS	Background Healthcare providers' (HCPs) recommendations for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are likely to increase the vaccination uptake. However, little is known about Ghanaian HCPs' general practices regarding HPV vaccination. We used Multi-Theory Model (MTM) constructs (i.e. participatory dialogue, behavioral confidence, environment, social and emotional transformation) to examine Ghanaian HCPs' attitudes towards HPV vaccination and their vaccination recommendation practices. Methods We conducted three, 60-minute focus group discussions (FGDs) with HCP in the second-largest government hospital in Ghana. Sixteen semi-structured open-ended questions based on MTM constructs were used to guide the FGDs. We explored HCPs' general knowledge about HPV, vaccination recommendation behavior, physical environment, and socio-cultural factors associated with the HPV vaccination. Data from the FGDs were transcribed and thematically coded using NVivo software. Results The sample of (n = 29) HCPs consisting of males (n = 15) and females (n = 14) between the ages of 29 and 42 years participated in the FGDs. Our analyses showed that HCPs (a) rarely offered HPV vaccination recommendations, (b) showed varied understanding about who should be vaccinated regarding age eligibility, gender, and infection status. Perceived barriers to HPV vaccination include (a) low urgency for vaccination education due to competing priorities such as malaria and HIV/AIDS; (b) lack of data on HPV vaccination; (c) lack of awareness about the vaccine safety and efficacy; (c) lack of HPV vaccine accessibility and (d) stigma, misconceptions and religious objections. HCPs expressed that their motivation for counseling their clients about HPV vaccination would be increased by having more knowledge about the vaccine's efficacy and safety, and the involvement of the parents, chiefs, churches, and opinion leaders in the vaccination programs. Conclusion The study's findings underscore the need for a comprehensive HPV vaccination education for HCPs in Ghana. Future HPV vaccination education programs should include information about the efficacy of the vaccine and effective vaccination messages to help mitigate HPV vaccine-related stigma.

The initiation, development and regulation of this symbiosis involve numerous signalling events between and within the symbiotic partners. Among other signals, phytohormones are known to play important roles at various stages of the interaction. During presymbiotic steps, plant roots exude strigolactones which stimulate fungal spore germination and hyphal branching, and promote the initiation of symbiosis. At later stages, different plant hormone classes can act as positive or negative regulators of the interaction. Although the fungus is known to reciprocally emit regulatory signals, its potential contribution to the phytohormonal pool has received little attention, and has so far only been addressed by indirect assays. In this study, using mass spectrometry, we analyzed phytohormones released into the medium by germinated spores of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungusRhizophagus irregularis. We detected the presence of a cytokinin (isopentenyl adenosine) and an auxin (indole-acetic acid). In addition, we identified a gibberellin (gibberellin A(4)) in spore extracts. We also used gas chromatography to show thatR.irregularisproduces ethylene from methionine and the alpha-keto gamma-methylthio butyric acid pathway. These results highlight the possibility for AM fungi to use phytohormones to interact with their host plants, or to regulate their own development.

We explored predictors of learning skills and depression in Indian adolescents. Methods Data on adolescents aged 10-19y (three groups: 5,840 unmarried males, 8,953 unmarried females, 4,933 married females) were available from the state-representative Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults survey in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for cluster sampling design and state fixed effects were used to examine factors (demographic, health/nutrition, social, and environmental) associated with three outcomes: reading proficiency, math proficiency, and depressive symptoms. Findings Learning skills were poor (28-61% lacked basic reading and math skills depending on adolescent group and outcome) and depression was common (8-26%). Better learning skills were predicted by greater household wealth (AOR 1.72-2.55 depending on group) and household head education (AOR 1.03-1.07 per year), being in school (AOR 4.19-18.65), parental support (AOR 1.11-1.39), having gender equal attitudes (AOR 1.56-2.67), number of food groups consumed at least weekly (unmarried females: AOR 1.11), and having an improved latrine (AOR 1.33-1.51). Poorer learning skills were predicted by family substance use (AOR 0.68-0.74), underweight (males: AOR 0.74), witnessing parental violence (AOR 0.66-0.78). Depressive symptoms were predicted by witnessing parental violence (AOR 1.51-1.92) and experiencing sexual abuse (AOR 2.30-6.16). Conclusion Factors across multiple life dimensions are associated with learning skills and depression in Indian adolescents. Adolescent-focused policies and programs should consider health/nutrition, social, and environmental aspects of life in vulnerable individuals.

Cooling-mediated protection from chemotherapy drug-induced cytotoxicity in human keratinocytes by inhibition of cellular drug uptake	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDUCED ALOPECIA; ADRIAMYCIN UPTAKE; BREAST-CANCER; HAIR; DOXORUBICIN; TEMPERATURE; CELLS; LOCALIZATION; CULTIVATION; RESISTANCE	Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) represents the most distressing side-effect for cancer patients. Scalp cooling is currently the only treatment to combat CIA, yet little is known about its cytoprotective effects in human hair follicles (HF). We have previously established in vitro human keratinocyte models to study the effects of taxanes and anthracyclines routinely-used clinically and reported that cooling markedly-reduced or even completely-prevented cytotoxicity in a temperature dependent manner. Using these models (including HF-derived primary keratinocytes), we now demonstrate that cooling markedly attenuates cellular uptake of the anthracyclines doxorubicin and epirubicin to reduce or prevent drug-mediated human keratinocyte cytotoxicity. We show marked reduction in drug uptake and nuclear localization qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy. We have also devised a flow cytometry-based methodology that permitted semi-quantitative analysis of differences in drug uptake, which demonstrated that cooling can reduce drug uptake by up to similar to 8-fold in comparison to normal/physiological temperature, an effect that was temperature-dependent. Our results provide evidence that attenuation of cellular drug uptake represents at least one of the mechanisms underpinning the ability of cooling to rescue human keratinocytes from chemotherapy drug-cytotoxicity, thus supporting the clinical efficacy of scalp cooling.

Silicon (Si) can mitigate such stress, and your supply in plants with the active absorption mechanism is carried out through roots. However, foliar spraying has been practiced to supply Si in PSS production nurseries. Althought it is known that Si via roots can alter C: N: P ratios, nothing has been reported about its supply via foliar spraying, nor whether such changes interfere with structural nutrient use efficiency and with plant physiological responses. Thus, this study aimes to asses whether Si foliar spraying changes C: N: P ratios and increases the nutritional efficiency of PSS, as well as whether water deficiency interferes with such a relationships. For these purposes, three experiments were carried out. In experiment I, treatments consisted of two sugarcane cultivars (CTC 4 and RB 966928) and three Si supply forms (in nutrient solution via roots [SiR], via foliar spraying [SiL], and one control with the absence of Si [-Si]). The same Si supply forms were used in the other two experiments. In experiment II, a short-term water deficit was induced by polyethylene glycol addition to nutrient solution (-0.6 MPa) for three days. In experiment III, a long-term water deficit was imposed using levels of soil water retention capacity (70% [no water deficit], 50% [moderate water deficit], and 30% [severe water deficit] for 30 days. Our findings revealed that Si supply decreased C concentrations regardless of water conditions and that N and P concentrations varied with Si supply form and water deficit level. Moreover, root- and foliar-applied Si modified the C: N: P stoichiometry and increased C use efficiency in PSS, which thus increased N and P use efficiencies. Such an increased nutritional performance helped adjust physiological parameters and increase dry matter yield in PSS, both under water stress and non-stress conditions. Further, Si foliar spraying promoted structural effects on PSS regardless of water conditions, even if sugarcane has an active absorption via roots. In conclusion, foliar spraying can be used to supply Si in PSS production nurseries.

All health care workers must receive a full-dose (3-dose vaccine series) to achieve >90% protection against hepatitis B virus. There is limited evidence available on vaccination coverage of HBV among health care workers in Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the national full-dose hepatitis B vaccination coverage and the associated factors among health care workers in Ethiopia. Methods Studies were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Google Scholar by using a combination of search terms with Boolean operators. The quality of each study was evaluated independently by three authors using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional studies. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA (TM) Version 14 software. Meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) method. The heterogeneity test was conducted by using I-squared (I-2) statistics. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed. Results A total of 15 articles with 5734 participants were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of full-dose hepatitis B virus vaccination coverage among health care workers in Ethiopia was 20.04% (95% CI: 13.83, 26.26); I-2 = 98.9%). Being male sex (p = 0.002), having work experience of less than 5 years (p < 0.001), educational level of diploma and below (p = 0.003), health care providers who received training on infection prevention (p < 0.001), and those who had a history of exposure to blood and body fluids (p = 0.001), were factors significantly associated with full-dose hepatitis B virus vaccination. Conclusion The national full-dose hepatitis B vaccination coverage among health care workers was low. Training of health care workers in infection prevention, particularly in hepatitis B and testing and providing hepatitis B vaccination for newly recruited staff and every 5 years for those long-term workers were recommended to increase the uptake of the vaccine.

Both have led to an increase of potentially inappropriate medication (PIM), illustrating the need to assess patients' attitudes towards deprescribing. We aimed to assess the prevalence of PIM use and whether this was associated with patient factors and willingness to deprescribe. Method We analysed data from the LESS Study, a cross-sectional study on self-reported medication and on barriers and enablers towards the willingness to deprescribe (rPATD questionnaire). The survey was conducted among multimorbid (>= 3 chronic conditions) participants >= 70 years with polypharmacy (>= 5 long-term medications). A subset of the Beers 2019 criteria was applied for the assessment of medication appropriateness. Results Data from 300 patients were analysed. The mean age was 79.1 years (SD 5.7). 53% had at least one PIM (men: 47.8%%, women: 60.4%%; p = 0.007). A higher number of medications was associated with PIM use (p = 0.002). We found high willingness to deprescribe in both participants with and without PIM. Willingness to deprescribe was not associated with PIM use (p = 0.25), nor number of PIMs (p = 0.81). Conclusion The willingness of older adults with polypharmacy towards deprescribing was not associated with PIM use in this study. These results suggest that patients may not be aware if they are taking PIMs. This implies the need for raising patients' awareness about PIMs through education, especially in females, in order to implement deprescribing in daily practice.

Aripiprazole has one of the fewest side-effects among the second-generation antipsychotics. Nevertheless, severe aripiprazole hepatotoxicity was reported in persons with a history of cocaine and alcohol abuse. Here we report that therapeutically relevant aripiprazole concentrations, equal to laboratory alert levels in patients' serum, reduce the rate of hepatocytes' division. This could be an underlying mechanism of severe liver injury development in the patients with a history of alcohol and cocaine abuse, the two hepatotoxic agents that require increased ability of liver self-regeneration. Monitoring liver functions is, therefore, important in the cases when aripiprazole is co-prescribed or used with drugs with potential hepatotoxic effects.

The aim of this study was to illustrate the timeline of actions taken and to measure and analyze their impact on surgical patients. Method This is a retrospective review of actions to limit Covid-19 spread and their impact on surgical activity in a Swiss tertiary referral center. Data on patient care, human resources and hospital logistics were collected. Impact on surgical activity was measured by comparing 6-week periods before and after the first measures were taken. Results After the first Swiss Covid-19 case appeared on February 25, progressively restrictive measures were taken over a period of 23 days. Covid-19 positive inpatients increased from 5 to 131, and ICU patients from 2 to 31, between days 10 and 30, respectively, without ever overloading resources. A 43% decrease of elective visceral surgical procedures was observed after Covid-19 (295 vs 165, p<0.01), while the urgent operations (all specialties) decreased by 39% (1476 vs 897, p<0.01). Fifty-two and 38 major oncological surgeries were performed, respectively, representing a 27% decrease (p = 0.316). Outpatient consultations dropped by 59%, from 728 to 296 (p<0.01). Conclusion While allowing for maximal care of Covid-19 patients during the pandemic, the shift of resources limited the access to elective surgical care, with less impact on cancer care.

Lower rates of ART initiation and decreased retention among ART-naive patients who consume alcohol enrolling in HIV care and treatment programs in Kenya and Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; INFECTED PATIENTS; CELL COUNT; SURVIVAL; IMPACT; DISORDERS	Objectives Almost 13 million people are estimated to be on antiretroviral therapy in Eastern and Southern Africa, and their disease course and program effectiveness could be significantly affected by the concurrent use of alcohol. Screening for alcohol use may be important to assess the prevalence of alcohol consumption and its impact on patient and programmatic outcomes. Methods As part of this observational study, data on patient characteristics and alcohol consumption were collected on a cohort of 765 adult patients enrolling in HIV care in East Africa. Alcohol consumption was assessed with the AUDIT questionnaire at enrollment. Subjects were classified as consuming any alcohol (AUDIT score >0), hazardous drinkers (AUDIT score >= 8) and hyper drinkers (AUDIT score >= 16). The effects of alcohol consumption on retention in care, death and delays in antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation were assessed through competing risk (Fine & Gray) models. Results Of all study participants, 41.6% consumed alcohol, 26.7% were classified as hazardous drinkers, and 16.0% as hyper drinkers. Depending on alcohol consumption classification, men were 3-4 times more likely to consume alcohol compared to women. Hazardous drinkers (median age 32.8 years) and hyper drinkers (32.7 years) were slightly older compared to non-hazardous drinkers (30.7 years) and non-hyper drinkers (30.8 years), (p-values = 0.014 and 0.053 respectively). Median CD4 at enrollment was 330 cells/mu l and 16% were classified World Health Organization (WHO) stage 3 or 4. There was no association between alcohol consumption and CD4 count or WHO stage at enrollment. Alcohol consumption was associated with significantly lower probability of ART initiation (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio aSHR = 0.77 between alcohol consumers versus non-consumers; p-value = 0.008), and higher patient non-retention in care (aSHR = 1.77, p-value = 0.023). Discussion Alcohol consumption is associated with significant delays in ART initiation and reduced retention in care for patients enrolling in HIV care and treatment programs in East Africa. Consequently, interventions that target alcohol consumption may have a significant impact on the HIV care cascade.

The recent reporting of the Thousand Cankers Disease (TCD) fungus, Geosmithia morbida, and of its vector, Pityophthorus juglandis, in walnut trees in Italy is alarming the whole of Europe. Although Italy is at present the only foothold of the disease outside North America, given the difficulties inherent in traditional identification of both members of this beetle/fungus complex, a rapid and effective protocol for the early detection and identification of TCD organisms is an absolute priority for Europe. Here we report the development of an effective and sensitive molecular tool based on simplex/duplex qPCR assays for the rapid, accurate and highly specific detection of both the bionectriaceous fungal pathogen and its bark-beetle vector. Our assay performed excellently, detecting minute amounts of target DNA without any non-specific amplification. Detection limits from various and heterogeneous matrices were lower than other reported assays. Our molecular protocol could assist in TCD organism interception at entry points, territory monitoring for the early identification and eradication of outbreaks, delineation of quarantine areas, and tracing back TCD entry and dispersal pathways.

In vivo and ex vivo assessment of bladder hyper-permeability and using molecular targeted magnetic resonance imaging to detect claudin-2 in a mouse model for interstitial cystitis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FREE-RADICALS; MRI; PREVALENCE	Objectives To determine if the URO-MCP-1 mouse model for bladder IC/BPS is associated with in vivo bladder hyper-permeability, as measured by contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI), and assess whether molecular-targeted MRI (mt-MRI) can visualize in vivo claudin-2 expression as a result of bladder hyper-permeability. Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic, painful condition of the bladder that affects primarily women. It is known that permeability plays a substantial role in IC/BPS. Claudins are tight junction membrane proteins that are expressed in epithelia and endothelia and form paracellular barriers and pores that determine tight junction permeability. Claudin-2 is a molecular marker that is associated with increased hyperpermeability in the urothelium. Materials and methods CE-MRI was used to measure bladder hyper-permeability in the URO-MCP-1 mice. A claudin-2-specific mt-MRI probe was used to assess in vivo levels of claudin-2. The mt-MRI probe consists of an antibody against claudin-2 conjugated to albumin that had Gd-DTPA (gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetate) and biotin attached. Verification of the presence of the mt-MRI probe was done by targeting the biotin moiety for the probe with streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (SA-HRP). Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was also used to assess bladder permeability. Results The URO-MCP-1 mouse model for IC/BPS was found to have a significant increase in bladder permeability, following liposaccharide (LPS) exposure, compared to saline-treated controls. mt-MRI- and histologically-detectable levels of the claudin-2 probe were found to increase with LPS -induced bladder urothelial hyper-permeability in the URO-MCP-1 IC mouse model. Levels of protein expression for claudin-2 were confirmed with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging. Claudin-2 was also found to highly co-localize with zonula occlidens-1 (ZO-1), a tight junction protein. Conclusion The combination of CE-MRI and TEER approaches were able to demonstrate hyper-permeability, a known feature associated with some IC/BPS patients, in the LPS-exposed URO-MCP-1 mouse model. This MRI approach could be clinically translated to establish which IC/BPS patients have bladder hyper-permeability and help determine therapeutic options. In addition, the in vivo molecular-targeted imaging approach can provide invaluable information to enhance our understanding associated with bladder urothelium hyper-permeability in IC/BPS patients, and perhaps be used to assist in developing further therapeutic strategies.

Lifecourse body mass index trajectories and cardio-metabolic disease risk in Guatemalan adults	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TO-HEIGHT RATIO; BLOOD-PRESSURE; LIFE-COURSE; CHILDHOOD GROWTH; IMPROVED NUTRITION; COHORT PROFILE; WEIGHT-GAIN; BIRTH; OBESITY; COUNTRIES	Little is known about body size over the life-course and non-communicable disease risk in low- and middle-income country populations. Our study explored the role of body mass index (BMI) trajectories from infancy through mid-adulthood on cardio-metabolic disease (CMD) risk factors in a prospective cohort of Guatemalan adults. Study participants were born in Guatemala from 1962-77 and have been followed prospectively since participating in a nutrition supplementation trial as children. Sex-specific BMI latent class trajectories were derived using latent class growth modeling from up to 22 possible BMI values from age 1 month to 42 years measured between 1969 and 2004. CMD risk factors were assessed in 2015-17 (at age 37-54 years) using anthropometry, blood glucose and lipids, and blood pressure. We used logistic regression to assess the role of BMI trajectory on CMD risk factors in 510 women and 346 men (N=856). We identified two BMI latent classes for women (low [n=287, 56.3%] and high [n=223, 43.7%]) and three classes for men (low [n=141, 40.8%], medium [n=160, 46.2%], and high [n=45, 13.0%]). Given the small percentage of men in the high BMI latent class, we collapsed the medium and high BMI latent classes for men (n=205, 59.1%). Among the most prevalent CMD risk factors at ages 37-54 years were abdominal obesity defined by waist-height ratio (99.6% of women and 87.3% of men), obesity defined by percent body fat (96.6% of women and 75.9% of men), low HDL-c (87.5% of women and 74.5% of men), and elevated triglycerides (78.3% of women and 73.6% of men). Except for obesity defined by BMI, we found no associations between BMI latent class and CMD risk factors in women. Among men, BMI latent class was not associated with CMD risk factors after controlling for current BMI. For the CMD risk factors we analyzed, the role of early life BMI on adult CMD appeared to be mediated by adult BMI among men-highlighting the need to establish and maintain healthy body weight over the life course.

J	Hakanson, CA; Fredriksson, F; Lilja, HE				Arana Hakanson, Cecilia; Fredriksson, Fanny; Engstrand Lilja, Helene			Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and educational level in adolescent and adult individuals after anesthesia and abdominal surgery during infancy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EARLY EXPOSURE; BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES; CHILDHOOD EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; ASSOCIATION; AGE; NEUROTOXICITY; PREVALENCE; APOPTOSIS; IMPACT	Aim Several studies in animal models have found that exposure to anesthetics in early life can cause cognitive dysfunction. Human studies show conflicting results and studies of cognitive function after anesthesia and neonatal surgery are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure to anesthesia and abdominal surgery during infancy was associated with cognitive dysfunction from the perspective of educational level, disposable income and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in adolescent and adult individuals. Methods A cohort study with patients born 1976 to 2002 that underwent abdominal surgery during infancy at a pediatric surgical center were matched by age, sex, and gestational age to ten randomly selected individuals from the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Individuals with chromosomal aberrations were excluded. Data on highest level of education and annual disposable income were attained from Statistics Sweden and the diagnosis of ADHD were retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Register. Results 485 individuals and 4835 controls were included. Median gestational age was 38 weeks (24-44) and median age at surgery was seven days (0-365). Three hundred sixty-six individuals (70.0%) underwent surgery during the neonatal period (< 44 gestational weeks). Median operating time was 80 minutes (10-430). The mean age at follow-up was 28 years. Fisher's exact test for highest level of education for the exposed and unexposed groups were respectively: university 35% and 33%, upper secondary 44% and 47%, compulsory 21% and 20% (p = 0.6718). The median disposable income was 177.7 versus 180.9 TSEK respectively (p = 0.7532). Exposed individuals had a prevalence of ADHD of 5.2% and unexposed 4.4% (p = 0.4191). Conclusions This study shows that exposure to anesthesia and abdominal surgery during infancy is not associated with cognitive dysfunction from the perspective of educational level, disposable income and ADHD in adolescent and adult individuals. Further studies in larger cohorts at earlier gestational ages are needed to verify these findings.

This created the need for alternate workflows with limited reliance on specialised reagents, equipment and staff. We present here the validation and implementation of such a workflow for preparing samples for downstream SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using liquid handling robots. The rapid sample preparation technique evaluated, which included sample centrifugation and heating prior to RT-PCR, showed a 97.37% (95% CI: 92.55-99.28%) positive percent agreement and 97.30% (95% CI: 90.67-99.52%) negative percent agreement compared to nucleic acid purification-based testing. This method was subsequently adopted as the primary sample preparation method in the Groote Schuur Hospital Virology Diagnostic Laboratory in Cape Town, South Africa.

Simulated climate change, but not predation risk, accelerates Aedes aegypti emergence in a microcosm experiment in western Amazonia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOSQUITOS	Climate change affects individual life-history characteristics and species interactions, including predator-prey interactions. While effects of warming onAedes aegyptiadults are well known, clarity the interactive effects of climate change (temperature and CO(2)concentration) and predation risk on the larval stage remains unexplored. In this study, we performed a microcosm experiment simulating temperature and CO(2)changes in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, for the year 2100. Simulated climate change scenarios (SCCS) were in accordance with the Fourth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Used SCCS were: Control (real-time current conditions in Manaus: average temperature is similar to 25.76 degrees C +/- 0.71 degrees C and similar to 477.26 +/- 9.38 parts per million by volume (ppmv) CO2); Light: increase of similar to 1,7 degrees C and similar to 218 ppmv CO2; Intermediate: increase of similar to 2.4 degrees C and similar to 446 ppmv CO2; and Extreme: increase of similar to 4.5 degrees C and similar to 861 ppmv CO2, all increases were relative to a Control SCCS. Light, Intermediate and Extreme SCCS reproduced, respectively, the B1, A1B, and A2 climatic scenarios predicted by IPCC (2007). We analyzedAedes aegyptilarval survivorship and adult emergence pattern with a factorial design combining predation risk (control and predator presence-Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalislarvae) and SCCS. Neither SCCS nor predation risk affectedAedes aegyptilarval survivorship, but adult emergence pattern was affected by SCCS. Accordingly, our results did not indicate interactive effects of SCCS and predation risk on larval survivorship and emergence pattern ofAedes aegyptireared in SCCS in western Amazonia.Aedes aegyptiis resistant to SCCS conditions tested, mainly due to high larval survivorship, even under Extreme SCCS, and warmer scenarios increase adultAedes aegyptiemergence. Considering thatAedes aegyptiis a health problem in western Amazonia, an implication of our findings is that the use of predation cues as biocontrol strategies will not provide a viable means of controlling the accelerated adult emergence expected under the IPCC climatic scenarios.

In this study, we conducted a retrospective survey of cases from an infertility center at an academic hospital. We reviewed the charts of all patients who received in-vitro fertilization and frozen-thawed blastocyst transfers (FBT) at the center from January 2009 to November 2019. One hundred and two patients with prior diagnosis of endometrial polyp that were treated with hysteroscopic polypectomy before received their first FBT at the center were identified as cases. Patients without prior diagnosis of endometrial polyp, and who received their first FBT at the center were defined as controls. Controls were enrolled at a 1-to-1 ratio to the cases. The cases and controls did not show differences in baseline characteristics, endometrial thickness, or the number of good blastocysts transferred. The clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates were similar. Regarding the optimal interval between polypectomy and FBT, a cut-off of 120 days was identified from the ROC curve. A stratified analysis showed that when FBT was performed within an interval of 120 days after polypectomy, there were higher biochemical pregnancy rates (73.2%, 45.2%; OR 3.3;P= .007) and clinical pregnancy rates (64.8%, 41.9%; OR 2.54;P= .032), when compared with intervals greater than 120 days. There were no significant differences in implantation and live birth rates. In conclusion, pregnancy rates following FBT in patients who had received prior endometrial polypectomy were comparable to pregnancy rates after FBT in patients without endometrial polyp. Subgroup analysis showed that an interval greater than 120 days between hysteroscopic polypectomy and FBT was associated with decreased pregnancy rates. Patients who wish to receive embryo transfer after polypectomy should wait no longer than 120 days.

Our objective was to identify early prognostic factors upon admission to optimize the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward. This French single-center prospective cohort study evaluated 152 patients with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, hospitalized in the Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology Department, at Pitie-Salpetriere's Hospital, in Paris, France, a tertiary care university hospital. Predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or death at day 14 (D14), of being discharge alive and severe status at D14 (remaining with ventilation, or death) were evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models; models' performances, including discrimination and calibration, were assessed (C-index, calibration curve, R-2, Brier score). A validation was performed on an external sample of 132 patients hospitalized in a French hospital close to Paris, in Aulnay-sous-Bois, ile-de-France. The probability of ICU transfer or death was 32% (47/147) (95% CI 25-40). Older age (OR 2.61, 95% CI 0.96-7.10), poorer respiratory presentation (OR 4.04 per 1-point increment on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical scale, 95% CI 1.76-9.25), higher CRP-level (OR 1.63 per 100mg/L increment, 95% CI 0.98-2.71) and lower lymphocytes count (OR 0.36 per 1000/mm(3)increment, 95% CI 0.13-0.99) were associated with an increased risk of ICU requirement or death. A 9-point ordinal scale scoring system defined low (score 0-2), moderate (score 3-5), and high (score 6-8) risk patients, with predicted respectively 2%, 25% and 81% risk of ICU transfer or death at D14. Therefore, in this prospective cohort study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward in France, a simplified scoring system at admission predicted the outcome at D14.

However, little is known concerning PA patterns throughout an intervention or engagement with trackers. The objective of the study was to explore patterns of Fitbit-measured PA and wear-time over 24-weeks and their relationship to changes in Actigraph-derived moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Methods Twenty-nine intervention participants (88%) from thewearableactivitytechnologyandaction-planning (WATAAP) trial in colorectal and endometrial cancer survivors accepted a Fitbit friend request from the research team to permit monitoring of Fitbit activity. Daily steps and active minutes were recorded for each participant over the 12-week intervention and throughout the follow-up period to 24-weeks. Accelerometer (GT9X) derived MVPA was assessed at end of intervention (12-weeks) and end of follow-up (24-weeks). Results Fitbit wear-time over the 24-weeks of data was remarkably consistent, with median adherence score of 100% for all weeks. During the intervention, participants recorded a median 8006 steps/day. Daily step count was slightly increased through week-13 to week-24 with a median of 8191 steps/day (p= 0.039). Actigraph and Fitbit derived measures were highly correlated but demonstrated poor agreement overall. Fitbit measured activity was closest to MVPA measured using Freedson cut-points as no bias was observed. Conclusions Step count was maintained throughout the trial displaying promise for the effectiveness of smart-wearable interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour beyond the intervention period. Further worthwhile work should compare more advanced smart-wearable technology with accelerometers in order to improve agreement and explore less resource-intensive methods to assess PA that could be scalable.

There is a need to move towards a more comprehensive person-centred approach to care that focuses on the cumulative impact of a number of conditions on daily activities and quality of life. This paper describes the intervention planning process for CHAT& PLANTM, a structured conversation intervention to promote personalised care and support self-management in older adults with complex conditions. Methods A theory-, evidence- and person-based approach to intervention development was undertaken. The intervention planning and development process included reviewing relevant literature and existing guidelines, developing guiding principles, conducting a behavioural analysis and constructing a logic model. Optimisation of the intervention and its implementation involved qualitative interviews with older adults with multimorbidity (n = 8), family caregivers (n = 2) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) (n = 20). Data were analysed thematically and informed changes to the intervention prototype. Results Review findings reflected the importance of HCPs taking a person-centred (rather than disease-centred) approach to their work with older people living with multimorbidity. This approach involves HCPs giving health service users the opportunity to voice their priorities, then using these to underpin the treatment and care plan that follow. Findings from the planning stage indicated that taking a structured approach to interactions between HCPs and health service users would enable elicitation of individual concerns, development of a plan tailored to that individual, negotiation of roles and review of goals as individual priorities change. In the optimisation stage, older adults and HCPs commented on the idea of a structured conversation to promote person-centred care and on its feasibility in practice. The idea of a shared, person-centred approach to care was viewed positively. Concerns were raised about possible extra work for those receiving or delivering care, time and staffing, and risk of creating another "tick-box" exercise for staff. Participants concluded that anyone with the appropriate skills could potentially deliver the intervention, but training was likely to be required to ensure correct utilisation and self-efficacy to deliver to the intervention. Conclusions CHAT&PLAN, a structured person-centred conversation guide appears acceptable and appealing to HCPs and older adults with multimorbidity. Further development of the CHAT&PLAN intervention should focus on ensuring that staff are adequately trained and supported to implement the intervention.

The endogenous vasodilator prostacyclin and its analogs are used as therapeutic agents for PAH. However, their pharmacological effects on occlusive vascular remodeling have not been elucidated yet. Selexipag is a recently approved, orally available and selective prostacyclin receptor agonist with a non-prostanoid structure. In this study, we investigated the pharmacological effects of selexipag on the pathology of chronic severe PAH in Sprague-Dawley and Fischer rat models in which PAH was induced by a combination of injection with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist Sugen 5416 and exposure to hypoxia (SuHx). Oral administration of selexipag for three weeks significantly improved right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy in Sprague-Dawley SuHx rats. Selexipag attenuated the proportion of lung vessels with occlusive lesions and the medial wall thickness of lung arteries, corresponding to decreased numbers of Ki-67-positive cells and a reduced expression of collagen type 1 in remodeled vessels. Administration of selexipag to Fischer rats with SuHx-induced PAH reduced RV hypertrophy and mortality caused by RV failure. These effects were probably based on the potent prostacyclin receptor agonistic effect of selexipag on pulmonary vessels. Selexipag has been approved and is used in the clinical treatment of PAH worldwide. It is thought that these beneficial effects of prostacyclin receptor agonists on multiple aspects of PAH pathology contribute to the clinical outcomes in patients with PAH.

Surgical treatment is provided by orthopedic surgeons and exercise therapy is provided by physical therapists. The aim of this study was to identify perceived facilitators and barriers-among orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists-towards coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment of patients eligible for knee replacement using pre-operative home-based exercise therapy with one exercise. Methods This qualitative study is embedded within the QUADX-1 randomized trial that investigates a model of coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment for patients eligible for knee replacement. Physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons working with patients with knee osteoarthritis in their daily clinical work were interviewed (one focus group and four single interviews) to explore their perceived facilitators and barriers related to pre-operative home-based exercise therapy with one exercise-only in patients eligible for knee replacement. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results From the thematic analysis three main themes emerged: 1) Physical therapists' dilemma with one home-based exercise, 2) Orthopedic surgeons' dilemma with exercise, and 3) Coordinated non-surgical and surgical care. Conclusion We found that the pre-operative exercise intervention created ambivalence in the professional role of both the physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons. The physical therapists were skeptical towards over-simplified exercise therapy. The orthopedic surgeons were skeptical towards the potential lack of (long-term) effect of exercise therapy in patients eligible for knee replacement. The consequence of these barriers and ambivalence in the professional role is important to consider when planning implementation of the model of coordinated non-surgical and surgical treatment.

The impact of lockdown enforcement during the SARSCoV-2 pandemic on the timing of presentation and early outcomes of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEATH	Introduction Early reports described decreased admissions for acute cardiovascular events during the SarsCoV-2 pandemic. We aimed to explore whether the lockdown enforced during the SARSCoV-2 pandemic in Israel impacted the characteristics of presentation, reperfusion times, and early outcomes of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Methods A multicenter prospective cohort comprising all STEMI patients treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention admitted to four high-volume cardiac centers in Israel during lockdown (20/3/2020-30/4/2020). STEMI patients treated during the same period in 2019 served as controls. Results The study comprised 243 patients, 107 during the lockdown period of 2020 and 136 during the same period in 2019, with no difference in demographics and clinical characteristics. Patients admitted in 2020 had higher admission and peak troponin levels, had a 2.4 fold greater likelihood of Door-to-balloon times> 90 min (95%CI: 1.2-4.9, p = 0.01) and 3.3 fold greater likelihood of pain-to-balloon times> 12 hours (OR 3.3, 95%CI: 1.3-8.1, p<0.01). They experienced higher rates hemodynamic instability (25.2% vs 14.7%, p = 0.04), longer hospital stay (median, IQR [4, 3-6 Vs 5, 4-6, p = 0.03]), and fewer early (<72 hours) discharge (12.4% Vs 32.4%, p<0.001). Conclusions The lockdown imposed during the SARSCoV-2 pandemic was associated with a significant lag in the time to reperfusion of STEMI patients. Measures to improves this metric should be implemented during future lockdowns.

Recently, the novel mammalian hepadnavirus, tentatively named domestic cat hepadnavirus (DCH), was detected in an immunocompromised cat. Herein, a collection of 209 cat sera and 15 hepato-diseased cats were screened for DCH using PCR, resulting in 12.4% and 20% positivity in the tested sera and necropsied cats, respectively. Among the DCH-positive sera, a significantly high level of co-detection with retroviral infection was found, with the highest proportion being co-detection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Full-length genome characterization of DCH revealed the genetic diversity between the nine Thai DCH sequences obtained, and that they phylogenetically formed three distinct monophyletic clades. A putative DCH recombinant strain was found, suggesting a possible role of recombination in DCH evolution. Additionally, quantitative PCR was used to determine the viral copy number in various organs of the DCH-moribund cats, while the pathological findings were compared to the viral localization in hepatocytes, adjacent to areas of hepatic fibrosis, by immunohistochemical (IHC) and western blot analysis. In addition to the liver, positive-DCH immunoreactivity was found in various other organs, including kidneys, lung, heart, intestine, brain, and lymph nodes, providing evidence of systemic infection. Ultrastructure of infected cells revealed electron-dense particles in the nucleus and cytoplasm of hepatocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. We propose the intracellular development mechanism of this virus. Although the definitive roles of pathogenicity of DCH remains undetermined, a contributory role of the virus associated with systemic diseases is possible.

RNA sequencing of whole blood in dogs with primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) reveals novel insights into disease pathogenesis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHOSPHOLIPID SCRAMBLASE 1; GENE-EXPRESSION; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE; CELL; SEQ; PAI-1; AUTOANTIBODIES; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is a life-threatening autoimmune disorder characterized by a self-mediated attack on circulating red blood cells. The disease occurs naturally in both dogs and humans, but is significantly more prevalent in dogs. Because of its shared features across species, dogs offer a naturally occurring model for studying IMHA in people. In this study, we used RNA sequencing of whole blood from treatment-naive dogs to study transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression in newly diagnosed animals compared to healthy controls. We found many overexpressed genes in pathways related to neutrophil function, coagulation, and hematopoiesis. In particular, the most highly overexpressed gene in cases was a phospholipase scramblase, which mediates the externalization of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of cell membranes. This family of genes has been shown to be critically important for programmed cell death of erythrocytes as well as the initiation of the clotting cascade. Unexpectedly, we found marked underexpression of many genes related to lymphocyte function. We also identified groups of genes that are highly associated with the inflammatory response and red blood cell regeneration in affected dogs. We did not find any genes that distinguished dogs that lived vs. those that died at 30 days following diagnosis, nor did we find any relevant genomic signatures of microbial organisms in the blood of affected animals. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings and assess their implication in developing novel therapeutic approaches for dogs and humans with IMHA.

J	Maeda, K				Maeda, Koki			Use of corn stover as bulking agent in dairy manure composting toward Japanese circular dairy farming	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NITRATE-NITROGEN CONCENTRATION; DENITRIFIER COMMUNITY; BIOGAS PRODUCTION; MATURE COMPOST; SWINE MANURE; PRETREATMENT; VIABILITY; PATHOGENS; EMISSION; ETHANOL	In response to the recent development of ear corn feeding systems and the shortage of bulking agents for manure composting in the Hokkaido region, the plausibility of using corn stover (a residue of ear corn harvesting) as an alternative bulking agent for dairy manure composting was tested. The temperature profile, quality of the final product, and greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated and compared with the values obtained from manure that used wheat straw, a typical bulking agent. A sufficiently high temperature profile (>70 degrees C) and active organic matter degradation were achieved by mixing in corn stover. After active organic matter degradation for 8 weeks, CO(2)production was significantly lower and the stable final products were obtained. The total solids level increased significantly, to 48.8-50.4%, while the C/N ratio dropped significantly, from 19.9-21.8 to 11.2-12.8. Methane emission from the corn-stover-based pile was 0.36% of initial volatile solids, while nitrous oxide emission was 0.58% of initial N, proving that the use of corn stover can mitigate greenhouse gas emission and that its mitigating effect was comparable to those of other bulking agents. Together, the results showed that the use of corn stover can be a suitable alternative bulking agent for dairy manure composting and can serve as part of an ecologically friendly and "circular" method of dairy farming.

In this preregistered study, we present a new way of distinguishing sports based on the eight DIAMONDS situational characteristics: Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Deception, and Sociality. In a cross-sectional online survey, athletes were asked to judge the sport they perform on the eight DIAMONDS dimensions. 138 sports were rated byN= 7,835 athletes using the 24-item version of the S8*questionnaire measuring the DIAMONDS. Descriptive and cluster analyses were performed, and situational characteristics profiles were computed. The sport-specific profiles and identified clusters resemble existing sport categorizations but add relevant information based on the situational characteristics of sports, especially regarding their relation with psychologically relevant variables.

C.; Vandermarliere, Benjamin			On the connection between real-world circumstances and online player behaviour: The case of EVE Online	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STRUCTURAL BALANCE	Games involving virtual worlds are popular in several segments of the population and societies. The online environment facilitates that players from different countries interact in a common virtual world. Virtual worlds involving social and economic interactions are particularly useful to test social and economic theories. Using data from EVE Online, a massive online multi-player game simulating a fantasy galaxy, we analyse the relation between the real-world context in which players live and their in-game behaviour at the country level. We find that in-game aggressiveness to non-player characters is positively related to real-world levels of aggressiveness as measured by the Global Peace Index and the Global Terrorist Index at the country level. The opposite is true for in-game aggressiveness towards other players, which seems to work as a safety valve for real-world player aggressiveness. The ability to make in-game friends is also positively related to real-world levels of aggressiveness in much the same way. In-game trading behaviour is dependent on the macro-economic environment where players live. The unemployment rate and exchange rate make players trade more efficiently and cautiously in-game. Overall, we find evidence that the real-world environment affects in-game behaviour, suggesting that virtual worlds can be used to experiment and test social and economic theories, and to infer real-world behaviour at the country level.

Its' important applications are to neutralize the heparin in human blood and analyze heparin structure in the clinic. However, the low productivity and activity of the enzyme have greatly hindered its applications. In this study, a novel Hep-I fromBacteroides cellulosilyticus(BcHep-I) was successfully cloned and heterologously expressed inE.coliBL21 (DE3) as a soluble protein. The molecular mass and isoelectric point (pI) of the enzyme are 44.42 kDa and 9.02, respectively. And the characterization of BcHep-I after purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography suggested that it is a mesophilic enzyme. BcHep-I can be activated by 1 mM Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, while severely inhibited by Zn2+, Co2+, and EDTA. The specific activity of the enzyme was 738.3 U center dot mg(-1)which is the highest activity ever reported. TheK(m)andV(max)were calculated as 0.17 mg center dot mL(-1)and 740.58 U center dot mg(-1), respectively. Besides, the half-life of 300 min at 30 degrees C showed BcHep-I has practical applications. Homology modeling and substrate docking revealed that Gln15, Lys74, Arg76, Lys104, Arg149, Gln208, Tyr336, Tyr342, and Lys338 were mainly involved in the substrate binding of Hep-I, and 11 hydrogen bonds were formed between heparin and the enzyme. These results indicated that BcHep-I with high activity has great potential applications in the industrial production of heparin, especially in the clinic to neutralize heparin.

The reason for this low uptake is not understood at the country or regional level. Therefore, this study identified determinants of LARC utilization in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based unmatched case control study, using LARC users as cases and short- acting reversible contraception (SARC) users as controls, had been conducted at fourteen public health institutions in Northwest Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select participants with a 1:2 case to control ratio (n = 1167). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of LARC utilization among family planning service users. Results Wealth status [AOR:1.87, 95%CI (1.08, 3.24)], history of abortion [AOR:2.69, 95%CI (1.41, 5.12)], limiting family size [AOR: 2.38, 95%CI (1.01, 5.62)], good knowledge about LARCs [AOR: 2.52, 95%CI (1.17, 5.41)], method convenience [AOR: 0.23, 95%CI (0.16, 0.34)], good availability of method [AOR:0.10 (0.05, 0.19)], less frequent visits to health facility [AOR:2.95, 95% CI(1.89, 4.62)], health care providers advice [AOR:10.69, 95%CI (3.27, 34.87)], partner approval [AOR:0.66, 95%CI (0.45, 0.97)], and favorable attitude towards LARCs [AOR:13.0, 95%CI (8.60, 19.72)] were significantly associated with LARC utilization. Conclusion Professional support, favorable attitude towards LARC use, high economic status, history of abortion, advantage of less frequent visits, having good knowledge towards LARC and interest of limiting births were significantly associated with LARC Utilization. On the other hand, perceived method convenience, and contraception availability were inversely associated with it. Family planning education about the benefits of LARC should be done by health providers and media. Male involvement in the counselling and decision making about the advantage of using LARC may improve the negative influence of partners on LARC utilization. It is also recommended that, future qualitative research further explore perceptions of LARC use.

This study explored the relationship between endogenous soluble sugar content and rooting ability of rice seedlings. We placed 15-day-old rice seedlings in controlled environment cabinets with stable light and sampled after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours of light to measure their soluble sugar content, nitrate content, starch content, soluble protein content and rooting ability. The soluble sugar content of the rice seedlings before rooting increased rapidly from 65.1 mg g(-1)to 126.3 mg g(-1)in the first 9 hours of light and then tended to stabilize; however, few significant changes in the other physiological indices were detected. With the light exposure time increasing from 3 hours to 12 hours, the rooting ability measured with fresh weight, dry weight, total length, and number of new roots increased by 91.7%, 120.0%, 60.6% and 30.3%, respectively. Rooting ability was related more closely to soluble sugar content than to nitrate-nitrogen content of rice seedlings before rooting and their correlation coefficients were 0.8582-0.8684 and 0.7045-0.7882, respectively. The stepwise regression analysis revealed that the soluble sugar content before rooting explained 73.6%-75.4% of the variance, and the nitrate-nitrogen content explained an additional 7.3%-14.2% of the variance in rooting ability, indicating that compared with nitrate-nitrogen content, soluble sugar content of rice seedlings before rooting was more dominant in affecting rooting ability. This study provides direct evidence of the relationship between the rooting ability and endogenous soluble sugar content of rice seedlings.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Functional connectivity of white matter as a biomarker of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; POSTERIOR CINGULATE; MEMORY DEFICITS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; RATING-SCALE; DIFFUSION; DEMENTIA; CORTEX; DAMAGE; MRI	Objective In vivofunctional changes in white matter during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been previously reported. Our objectives are to measure changes in white matter functional connectivity (FC) in an elderly population undergoing cognitive decline as AD develops, to establish their relationship to neuropsychological scores of cognitive abilities, and to assess the performance in prediction of AD using white matter FC measures as features. Methods Analyses were conducted using resting state functional MRI and neuropsychological data from 383 ADNI participants, including 136 cognitive normal (CN) controls, 46 with significant memory concern, 83 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 37 with MCI, 46 with late MCI, and 35 with AD dementia. FC metrics between segregated white matter tracts and discrete gray matter volumes or between white matter tracts were quantitatively analyzed and characterized, along with their relationships to 6 cognitive measures. Finally, supervised machine learning was implemented on white matter FCs to classify the participants and performance of the classification was evaluated. Results Significant decreases in FC measures were found in white matter with prominent, specific, regional deficits appearing in late MCI and AD dementia patients from CN. These changes significantly correlated with neuropsychological measurements of impairments in cognition and memory. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing AD dementia and CN using white matter FCs were 0.83 and 0.81 respectively. Conclusions and relevance The white matter FC decreased in late MCI and AD dementia patients compared to CN participants, and this decrease was correlated with cognitive measures. White matter FC is valuable in the prediction of AD. All these findings suggest that white matter FC may be a promising avenue for understanding functional impairments in white matter tracts during AD progression.

J	Claassens, J; Koomen, E; Rouwendal, J				Claassens, Jip; Koomen, Eric; Rouwendal, Jan			Urban density and spatial planning: The unforeseen impacts of Dutch devolution	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESIDENTIAL AREAS; COMPACT CITY; OPEN-SPACE; DENSIFICATION; NETHERLANDS; PRESERVATION; CONSUMPTION; CHALLENGES; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS	National spatial planning has strongly influenced urban development and open space preservation in the Netherlands since the 1950s and established the country's reputation as a planner's paradise. The gradual withdrawal from this active and stringent type of planning in favour of decentralisation and deregulation has received less attention and its impacts on urban development patterns remain poorly studied. This study investigates residential development since 2000 in relation to the changing planning context. We focused on residential densification and the redevelopment of greyfields and brownfields as desired outcomes of policies that aim to limit urban development in open landscapes. Using detailed spatial housing and land-use data we quantified the relative importance of different urban development processes over three subsequent six-year periods characterised by slowly decreasing national policy attention to steering residential development. Our results indicate that, while the national policy instruments got weaker, the share of residential development within existing urban areas increased. Our results lend further credence to the suggestion that the abandoned national spatial planning policy targeted at housing construction within urban development zones that were predominantly defined on greenfield near existing cities, limited urban redevelopment. Despite reduced government spending, densities increased within existing urban areas as general, local-level restrictive policies with respect to greenfield development remained in place and demand for urban housing remained unabated.

Effect of land cover and landscape fragmentation on anopheline mosquito abundance and diversity in an important Colombian malaria endemic region	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MARK-RELEASE-RECAPTURE; DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; SPECIES RICHNESS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; LARVAL HABITATS; VECTOR; DEFORESTATION; DARLINGI; BEHAVIOR; DISCRIMINATION	Landscape structure influences the distribution and abundance of anopheline mosquitoes and has an indirect impact on malaria transmission. This work aimed to determine the effect of land cover and landscape fragmentation on anopheline mosquito abundance and diversity in an important Colombian malaria endemic area, the Bajo Cauca region. Diversity indices were calculated forAnophelesmosquitoes collected in various localities of the region. Land cover types were characterized using orthorectified aerial photographs to estimate landscape metrics. The relationship between landscape fragmentation and species diversity was evaluated by regression analysis. The correlation between species abundance and land cover types was determined using canonical correspondence analyses. Results showed a statistically significant tendency for a lower diversity of theAnophelescommunity in landscapes with higher patch number, patch density and effective mesh size. For most species, there was evidence of a significant relationship between species abundance and land covers modified by anthropic activities which generate forest loss. These results indicate that activities that modify the landscape structure and land cover composition generate changes that affect the spatial distribution and composition of epidemiologically-importantAnopheles species, which may impact malaria distribution in a region. This information is useful to guide control interventions that promote unfavorable landscapes for malaria vector propagation.

J	Kalinka, A; Achrem, M				Kalinka, Anna; Achrem, Magdalena			The distribution pattern of 5-methylcytosine in rye (SecaleL.) chromosomes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS; CENTROMERIC CHROMATIN; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; ORGANIZATION; HETEROCHROMATIN; TRITICALE; SEQUENCE; WHEAT	The rye (SecaleL.) genome is large, and it contains many classes of repetitive sequences.Secalespecies differ in terms of genome size, heterochromatin content, and global methylation level; however, the organization of individual types of sequences in chromosomes is relatively similar. The content of the abundant subtelomeric heterochromatin fraction in rye do not correlate with the global level of cytosine methylation, hence immunofluorescence detection of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) distribution in metaphase chromosomes was performed. The distribution patterns of 5-methylcytosine in the chromosomes ofSecalespecies/subspecies were generally similar. 5-methylcytosine signals were dispersed along the entire length of the chromosome arms of all chromosomes, indicating high levels of methylation, especially at retrotransposon sequences. 5-mC signals were absent in the centromeric and telomeric regions, as well as in subtelomeric blocks of constitutive heterochromatin, in each of the taxa studied. Pericentromeric domains were methylated, however, there was a certain level of polymorphism in these areas, as was the case with the nucleolus organizer region. Sequence methylation within the region of the heterochromatin intercalary bands were also demonstrated to be heterogenous. Unexpectedly, there was a lack of methylation in rye subtelomeres, indicating that heterochromatin is a very diverse fraction of chromatin, and its epigenetic regulation or potential influence on adjacent regions can be more complex than has conventionally been thought. Like telomeres and centromeres, subtelomeric heterochromatin can has a specific role, and the absence of 5-mC is required to maintain the heterochromatin state.

Risk factors forBordetella pertussisdisease in hospitalized children	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MATERNAL HIV-INFECTION; TIME PCR ASSAY; BORDETELLA-PERTUSSIS; INFANT PERTUSSIS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; IMMUNIZATION; PARAPERTUSSIS; SURVEILLANCE; VACCINATION; PREGNANCY	Introduction Despite a resurgence of disease, risk factors for pertussis in children in low and middle-income countries are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate risk factors for pertussis disease in African children hospitalized with severe LRTI. Methods A prospective study of children hospitalized with severe LRTI in Cape Town, South Africa was conducted over a one-year period. Nasopharyngeal and induced sputum samples from child and nasopharyngeal sample from caregiver were tested forBordetella pertussisusing PCR (IS481+/hIS1001). History and clinical details were documented. Results 460 children with a median age of 8 (IQR 4-18) months were enrolled.B.pertussisinfection was confirmed in 32 (7.0%). The adjusted risk of confirmed pertussis was significantly increased if infants were younger than two months [aRR 2.37 (95% CI 1.03-5.42]), HIV exposed but uninfected (aRR 3.53 [95% CI 1.04-12.01]) or HIV infected (aRR 4.35 [95% CI 1.24-15.29]). Mild (aRR 2.27 [95% CI 1.01-5.09]) or moderate (aRR 2.70 [95% CI 1.13-6.45]) under-nutrition in the children were also associated with higher risk. The highest adjusted risk occurred in children whose caregivers hadB.pertussisdetected from nasopharyngeal swabs (aRR 13.82 [95% CI 7.76-24.62]). Completion of the primary vaccine schedule (three or more doses) was protective (aRR 0.28 [95% CI 0.10-0.75]). Conclusions HIV exposure or infection, undernutrition as well as detection of maternal nasalB.pertussiswere associated with increased risk of pertussis in African children, especially in young infants. Completed primary vaccination was protective. There is an urgent need to improve primary pertussis vaccine coverage in low and middle-income countries. Pertussis vaccination of pregnant women, especially those with HIV infection should be prioritized.

In this context, the aims of this study were (i) to register the abundance and morphological features ofL.spicatapopulations from Ventanas, Horcon and Cachagua (sites with different pollution histories and located only up to 40 km from the QB); ii) to determine the heavy metals (HMs) concentration in seawater and marine sediments; and (iii) to evaluatein vitrothe effects of exposure to seawater from the three sampling sites on spore release and early developmental stages, up to the juvenile sporophyte. Results showed that the chronically exposed Ventanas kelp population had the smallest adult individuals in comparison with the other sites. Ventanas and Horcon registered high HMs concentration in the seawater and marine sediments exceeding the international permissible limits (e.g in seawater Cu 20-859 mu g L-1; sediments Cu > 50,000 mu g kg(-1)). Unexpectedly in Cachagua, a site often considered unpolluted, high concentrations of Cu and As were also registered in the seawater (859 and 1,484 mu g L-1, respectively) and of As in marine sediments (20,895 mu g kg(-1)). Exposure of gametophytes to the seawater from Ventanas resulted in a developmental delay compared to the other treatments; however, low sporophyte production was determined in all treatments. Our results indicate that QB, more notably Ventanas, induce highly negative effects on individual development, and consequently on seaweed populations, which suggest a long-term negative impact on the community structure of these marine zones. Furthermore, the high concentrations of HMs reported here at Cachagua suggest a recent expansion of pollution along the central coast of Chile, evidencing effects on the marine ecosystem health even on sites far from the pollution source.

SR-BI mediates neutral lipid sorting from LDL to lipid droplets and facilitates their formation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHOLESTERYL ESTER UPTAKE; SCAVENGER RECEPTOR-BI; SELECTIVE UPTAKE; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEINS; CELLS; METABOLISM; PATHWAY; BINDING; MICE; LOCALIZATION	SR-BI binds various lipoproteins, including HDL, LDL as well as VLDL, and mediates selective cholesteryl ester (CE) uptake. HDL derived CE accumulates in cellular lipid droplets (LDs), which also store triacylglycerol (TAG). We hypothesized that SR-BI could significantly facilitate LD formation, in part, by directly transporting LDL derived neutral lipids (NL) such as CE and TAG into LDs without lipolysis andde novolipid synthesis. SR-BI overexpression greatly increased LDL uptake and LD formation in stably transfected HeLa cells (SR-BI-HeLa). LDs isolated from SR-BI-HeLa contained 4- and 7-times more CE and TAG, respectively, than mock-transfected HeLa (Mock-HeLa). In contrast, LDL receptor overexpression in HeLa (LDLr-HeLa) greatly increased LDL uptake, degradation with moderate 1.5- and 2-fold increases of CE and TAG, respectively. Utilizing CE and TAG analogs, BODIPY-TAG (BP-TAG) and BODIPY-CE (BP-CE), for tracking LDL NL, we found that after initial binding of LDL to SR-BI-HeLa, apoB remained at the cell surface, while BP-CE and BP-TAG were sorted and simultaneously transported together to LDs. Both lipids demonstrated limited internalization to lysosomes or endoplasmic reticulum in SR-BI-HeLa. In LDLr-HeLa, NLs demonstrated clear lysosomal sequestration without their sorting to LDs. An inhibition of TAG and CEde novosynthesis by 90-95% only reduced TAG and CE LD content by 45-50%, and had little effect on BP-CE and BP-TAG transport to LDs in SR-BI HeLa. Furthermore, intravenous infusion of 1-2 mg of LDL increased liver LDs in normal (WT) but not in SR-BI KO mice. Mice transgenic for human SR-BI demonstrated higher liver LD accumulation than WT mice. Finally, Electro Spray Infusion Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) using deuterated d-CE found that LDs accumulated up to 40% of unmodified d-CE LDL. We conclude that SR-BI mediates LDL-induced LD formationin vitroandin vivo. In addition to cytosolic NL hydrolysis andde novolipid synthesis, this process includes selective sorting and transport of LDL NL to LDs with limited lysosomal NL sequestration and the transport of LDL CE, and TAG directly to LDs independently ofde novosynthesis.

Assessing concerns for the economic consequence of the COVID-19 response and mental health problems associated with economic vulnerability and negative economic shock in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTERVENTIONS; STRESS; CRIME	Many different countries have been under lockdown or extreme social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The potentially far-reaching side effects of these measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N = 3,504), Spain (N = 3,524) and the United Kingdom (N = 3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizens' concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to predict the level of stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find that the concern for the economy and for "the way out" of the lockdown is diffuse and there is evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety, and depression, based on their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock.

Here, we evaluated the patterns of ESBL resistance in children enrolled into a surveillance study for community acquired bacteremic syndromes across health facilities in Central and Northwestern Nigeria. Method Blood culture was performed for children aged less than 5 years suspected of having sepsis from Sept 2008-Dec 2016. Blood was incubated using the BACTEC(00AE) system and Enterobacteriacea identified to the species level using Analytical Profile Index (API20E(R)). Antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined by the disc diffusion method. Real time PCR was used to characterize genes responsible for ESBL production. Result Of 21,000 children screened from Sept 2008-Dec 2016, 2,625(12.5%) were culture-positive. A total of 413 Enterobacteriaceae available for analysis were screened for ESBL. ESBL production was detected in 160 Enterobacteriaceae, high resistance rates were observed among ESBL-positive isolates for Ceftriaxone (92.3%), Aztreonam (96.8%), Cefpodoxime (96.3%), Cefotaxime (98.8%) and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (90%), while 87.5%, 90.7%, and 91.9% of the isolates were susceptible to Imipenem, Amikacin and Meropenem respectively. Frequently detected resistance genes were blaTEM-83.8% (134/160), and, blaCTX-M 83.1% (133/160) followed by blaSHVgenes 66.3% (106/160). Co-existence of blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV was seen in 94/160 (58.8%), blaCTX-M and blaTEM in 118/160 (73.8%), blaTEM and blaSHV in 97/160 (60.6%) and blaCTX-M and blaSHV in 100/160 (62.5%) of isolates tested. Conclusion Our results indicate a high prevalence of bacteremia from ESBL Enterobacteriaceae in this population of children. These are resistant to commonly used antibiotics and careful choice of antibiotic treatment options is critical. Further studies to evaluate transmission dynamics of resistance genes could help in the reduction of ESBL resistance in these settings.

J	Kazibudzki, PT; Trojanowski, TW				Kazibudzki, Pawel Tadeusz; Trojanowski, Tomasz Witold			Examination of marketing mix performance in relation to sustainable development of the Poland's confectionery industry	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; LIKERT SCALES; FOOD; CONSUMPTION; IMPACT	The conventional concept of marketing mix does not take into account the idea of sustainable development. The basic objective of this examination is to analyze and evaluate the performance of selected marketing mix elements from the perspective of the Poland's confectionery industry's sustainable development. The questionnaire survey was designed for this purpose. The purpose of the research questions was to evaluate a degree of development for selected elements of marketing mix from the perspective of sustainable development of the Poland's confectionery industry. Thus, a novel development ratio based on the distance from exemplary performance was proposed. Next, aseminal approach to pairwise comparisons technique was applied for the importance evaluation of each survey question in order to provide a weighted average Mean Development Ratio (MdeR) for each element of marketing mix. In this process the seminal methodology for pairwise comparisons was applied i.e. a non-heuristic approach to pairwise comparisons technique with verifiable accuracy and reliability. In consequence, assuming that all elements of marketing mix have some designated importance in the process of sustainable development, a total weighted average MdeR for performance of all elements of marketing mix was computed and evaluated. Noticeably, the total weighted average MdeR for performance of all elements of marketing mix cannot be considered as satisfactory from the perspective of sustainable development of the Poland's confectionery industry.

This leads to toxicity, particularly when the toxic has entered the food chain. Perak River is one of the most dynamic rivers for the Malaysian population. Therefore, in consideration of the safety issue, this study was conducted to assess the concentration of such metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Pb) in the muscles of most widely consumed fish species (Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Puntius bulum, Puntius daruphani, Hexanematichthys sagor, Channa striatus, Mystacoleucus marginatus, and Devario regina) from different locations of Perak River, Malaysia by employing inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Among the trace metals, Fe and Cd were found to be the highest (29.33-148.01 mu g/g) and lowest (0.16-0.49 mu g/g) concentration in all of the studied species, respectively. Although the estimated daily intakes (mu g/kg/day) of Cd (0.65-0.85), Fe (79.27-352.00) and Pb (0.95-12.17) were higher than their reference, the total target hazard quotients values suggested that the local residents would not experience any adverse health effects from its consumption. In contrast, the target cancer risk value suggested that all fish species posed a potential cancer risk due to Cd and cumulative cancer risk values, strongly implying that continuous consumption of studied fish species would cause cancer development to its consumers.

Material and methods The protein expression of the biomarkers was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Patients were categorized according to their sensitivity to first line PDCT: with a Progression-free survival (PFS) >= 3 months after completion of treatment considered "sensitive" and < 3 months after completion of treatment considered "refractory". PFS and overall survival were computed using Kaplan-Meier curves with 95% confidence interval. Results and conclusion The study included 46 patients, with 21 and 25 of the patients having "sensitive" and "refractory" disease, respectively. The majority of patients had a high DLL3 expression (n = 38), while a minority had Notch 1-high expression (n = 10). The chi-square test showed that there was a statistically significant negative association between Notch1 and Ascl1 expression (p = 0.013). The overall survival for patients with Notch1- high vs. low expression was 8.1 vs. 12.4 months, respectively (p = 0.036). Notch1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.02). No other biomarker showed any prognostic impact in this highly selected SCLC cohort. DLL3 is highly expressed in the majority of advanced staged SCLC cases, as expected. In the same patient population, Notch1 expression might have a potential prognostic implication, by driving a non-neuroendocrine differentiation process. Given the small number of cases with Notch1 high expression, the results of this study needs to be confirmed on a larger cohort.

Antigen-agnostic microfluidics-based circulating tumor cell enrichment and downstream molecular characterization	PLOS ONE			English	Article							METASTASIS; HETEROGENEITY; EXPRESSION; SEPARATION; RELEVANCE	Circulating tumor cells (CTC) isolated from the peripheral blood of cancer patients by a minimally invasive procedure provide surrogate markers of the tumor that can be repeatedly sampled. However, the selection and enumeration of CTCs by traditional methods based on surface proteins like EPCAM may not detect CTCs with a mesenchymal phenotype. Here, we employed an antibody-agnostic platform, the Parsortix(R) PR1 system, which enriches CTCs based on cell size and membrane deformability. We evaluated the linearity, sensitivity, and specificity of the Parsortix PR1 system in tandem with 3 downstream molecular characterization techniques using healthy donor blood spiked with cultured cell lines. Signal amplification of mRNA using a QuantiGene 25-gene assay was able to quantitate multiple epithelial genes, including CDH1, EGFR, ERBB2, KRT18, and MUC1, from high numbers of spiked cells and was able to detect KRT18 when only 50 MCF-7 or SUM190 cells were spiked into healthy donor blood. However, target amplification of mRNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed better sensitivity; qPCR without pre-amplification was able to detect CTC-related genes in Parsortix PR1-enriched cells when as few as 5 SKBR3 cells were spiked into blood. Finally, the HTG EdgeSeq nuclease protection assay was able to profile mRNA expression of over 2,560 cancer-related genes from Parsortix PR1 enriched cells, showing enrichment in cancer signaling pathways and ERBB2, KRT19, and KRT7. Overall, the Parsortix PR1 platform may be amenable to transition into routine clinical workflows.

Knowledge of the usual presentation of scalp melanoma can help to understand the reasons for the poor outcomes of treatment. This is the first publication to describe the clinical, histopathological and epidemiological profile of patients with scalp melanoma in a Latin American population. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed of all primary cutaneous melanoma seen by the A.C.Camargo Cancer Center between 2008 and 2018, using an electronic health records to access clinical and pathology data. Results When compared to trunk and limbs, increasing age is expected for patients with scalp melanoma (10.865; CI (95%) = [8.303; 13.427]). Regarding risk of invasion, scalp melanomas have a higher chance to be invasive than in situ (OR = 1.783; CI (95%) = [1.196; 2.657]) and present with higher Breslow thickness (OR = 3.005; CI (95%) = [2.507; 3.601]). Scalp site was significantly associated with male sex (OR = 3.750; CI (95%) = [2.533; 5.554]), perineural invasion (OR = 13.739; CI (95%) = [5.919; 31.895]), ulceration (OR = 2.311; CI (95%) = [1.488; 3.588]), and mitosis (OR = 2.366; CI (95%) = [1.701; 3.292]), when compared to trunk and limbs melanoma. Conclusion In the present study, head and neck melanomas represented 14.9% of all melanomas, a frequency slightly lower than that described in the literature and the mean age of melanoma on the scalp found was lower than that reported in the literature. These results could be explained by the demographic characteristics of Brazil, which has a population with a lower life expectancy compared to the European and North American population. Scalp melanomas occurred in older men, were diagnosed with greater Breslow thickness and were associated with the presence of perineural invasion, mitosis and ulceration.

J	Eckford-Soper, LK; Canfield, DE				Eckford-Soper, Lisa Kathleen; Canfield, Donald E.			The global explosion of eukaryotic algae: The potential role of phosphorus?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY; DIFFUSIVE BOUNDARY-LAYERS; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; GROWTH-RATE; PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN; TRANSPORTER GENE; CELL-SIZE; MARINE	There arose one of the most important ecological transitions in Earth's history approximately 750 million years ago during the middle Neoproterozoic Era (1000 to 541 million years ago, Ma). Biomarker evidence suggests that around this time there was a rapid shift from a predominantly bacterial-dominated world to more complex ecosystems governed by eukaryotic primary productivity. The resulting 'Rise of the algae' led to dramatically altered food webs that were much more efficient in terms of nutrient and energy transfer. Yet, what triggered this ecological shift? In this study we examined the theory that it was the alleviation of phosphorus (P) deficiency that gave eukaryotic alga the prime opportunity to flourish. We performed laboratory experiments on the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis salinaand the eukaryotic algaeTetraselmis suecicaand examined their ability to compete for phosphorus. Both these organisms co-occur in modern European coastal waters and are not known to have any allelopathic capabilities. The strains were cultured in mono and mixed cultures in chemostats across a range of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations to reflect modern and ancient oceanic conditions of 2 mu M P and 0.2 mu M P, respectively. Our results show that the cyanobacteria outcompete the algae at the low input (0.2 mu M P) treatment, yet the eukaryotic algae were not completely excluded and remained a constant background component in the mixed-culture experiments. Also, despite their relatively large cell size, the algaeT.suecicahad a high affinity for DIP. With DIP input concentrations resembling modern-day levels (2 mu M), the eukaryotic algae could effectively compete against the cyanobacteria in terms of total biomass production. These results suggest that the availability of phosphorus could have influenced the global expansion of eukaryotic algae. However, P limitation does not seem to explain the complete absence of eukaryotic algae in the biomarker record before ca. 750 Ma.

J	Han, H; Hao, LN; Cheng, DQ; Xu, H				Han, Hui; Hao, Lina; Cheng, Dequan; Xu, He			GAN-SAE based fault diagnosis method for electrically driven feed pumps	PLOS ONE			English	Article							REPRESENTATIONS	The running of high-speed electrically driven feed pump has a direct impact on the safety of personnel equipment and economic benefits of power plant, as the result, intelligent condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of electrically driven feed pump becomes an urgent need. In the practical process of electrically driven feed pump fault diagnosis, the running of the equipment is in normal state for a long time, occasionally, with faults, which makes the fault data very rare in a large number of monitoring data, and makes it difficult to extract the internal fault features behind the original time series data, When the deep learning theory is used in practice, the imbalance between the fault data and the normal data occurs in the operation data set. In order to solve the problem of data imbalance, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method of GAN-SAE. This method first makes compensation for the imbalance of sample data based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and then uses the Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE) method to extract the signal features. By designing the fault diagnosis program, compared with only using SAE, back propagation neural networks (BP) and multi-hidden layer neural networks(MNN) method, the GAN-SAE method can offer better capability of extracting features, and the accuracy of fault diagnosis of electrically driven feed pump could be improved to 98.89%.

However, some patients could have poor clinical outcomes in spite of DTBT <90 minutes, which suggest the importance of therapeutic targets except DTBT. The purpose of this study was to find factors associated with poor clinical outcomes in STEMI patients with DTBT Methods This retrospective study included 383 STEMI patients with DTBT <90 minutes. The primary endpoint was the major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as the composite of all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, and acute heart failure requiring hospitalization. Result The median follow-up duration was 281 days, and the cumulative incidence of MACE was 16.2%. In the multivariate Cox hazard model, low body mass index (< 20 kg/m(2)) (vs. >20 kg/m(2): HR 2.80, 95% CI 1.39-5.64, p = 0.004), history of previous myocardial infarction (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.06-5.37, p = 0.04), and Killip class 3 or 4 (vs. Killip class 1 or 2: HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.30-4.40, p = 0.005) were significantly associated with MACE. In another multivariate Cox hazard model, flow worsening during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.79-5.86, p<0.001) and use of mechanical support (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.71-5.79, p<0.001) were significantly associated with MACE, whereas radial approach (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p = 0.02) was inversely associated with MACE. Conclusion Low body mass index, Killip class 3/4, history of previous myocardial infarction, use of mechanical support, and flow worsening were significantly associated with MACE, whereas radial-access was inversely associated with MACE. It is important to avoid flow worsening during primary PCI even when appropriate DTBT was achieved.

This is especially worrying for the Caribbean branching coralAcropora palmatawhich has already seen an 80% decrease in cover primarily due to disease. Despite the importance of this keystone species, there has yet to be a characterization of its transcriptomic response to disease exposure. In this study we provide the first transcriptomic analysis of 12A.palmatagenotypes and their symbiont Symbiodiniaceae exposed to disease in 2016 and 2017. Year was the primary driver of gene expression variance forA.palmataand the Symbiodiniaceae. We hypothesize that lower expression of ribosomal genes in the coral, and higher expression of transmembrane ion transport genes in the Symbiodiniaceae indicate that a compensation or dysbiosis may be occurring between host and symbiont. Disease response was the second driver of gene expression variance forA.palmataand included a core set of 422 genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, 2 genes (a predicted cyclin-dependent kinase 11b and aspartate 1-decarboxylase) showed negative Log2 fold changes in corals showing transmission of disease, and positive Log2 fold changes in corals showing no transmission of disease, indicating that these may be important in disease resistance. Co-expression analysis identified two modules positively correlated to disease exposure, one enriched for lipid biosynthesis genes, and the other enriched in innate immune genes. The hub gene in the immune module was identified as D-amino acid oxidase, a gene implicated in phagocytosis and microbiome homeostasis. The role of D-amino acid oxidase in coral immunity has not been characterized but could be an important enzyme for responding to disease. Our results indicate thatA.palmatamounts a core immune response to disease exposure despite differences in the disease type and virulence between 2016 and 2017. These identified genes may be important for future biomarker development in this Caribbean keystone species.

J	Du, YX; Du, Y; Yao, NL				Du, Yuxian; Du, Yan; Yao, Nengliang			Patient-provider relationships in China: A qualitative study on the perspectives of healthcare students and junior professionals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HOSPITALS; REFORM; TRUST	Background Mistrust and conflicts in patient-provider relationships (PPR) have become prevalent in China. The frequency of verbal and physical violence against healthcare workers has been increasing, but few interventions seem to be effective. Limited prior research has focused on the perspectives of healthcare professionals in training. This paper aimed to understand their viewpoints and conceptualize potentially actionable areas for future policy interventions. Methods We analyzed de-identified training registration data of a convenience sample of 151 healthcare students and 38 junior professionals from 20 provinces in China. One open-ended question in the registration form asked the participant to comment on PPRs in China. We used qualitative thematic coding to analyze the narrative data. All answers were categorized into three overarching frames: patients, providers, and external agencies/regulations. Frequently mentioned themes in each frame were evaluated to generate an overall theoretical framework. Findings Although fewer than 25% indicated that current PPRs are "good" or acceptable, 98% of respondents were optimistic about the future improvement of these relationships. The leading factors of PPRs mentioned as patient-relevant were eroding trust in the physician, unrealistic expectations, and ineffective communication. The provider-relevant themes highlighted were poor service quality, ineffective communication, and heavy workload. Leading themes relevant to external agencies or regulations were dysfunctional administration system, negative media reports, and disparity in healthcare resource distribution. Interpretation Healthcare professionals in training had a negative view of the current situation but had confidence in future improvement. Patient, provider, and societal factors all contributed to the tension between patients and providers. All aspects of the healthcare sector should be carefully considered when contemplating policy or social interventions to improve the patient-provider relationship.

J	Owusu, D; Massey, Z; Popova, L				Owusu, Daniel; Massey, Zachary; Popova, Lucy			An experimental study of messages communicating potential harms of electronic cigarettes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOBACCO PRODUCT USE; UNITED-STATES; YOUNG-ADULTS; SMOKERS INTEREST; WARNING LABELS; FEAR APPEALS; SMOKING; ADVERTISEMENTS; CESSATION; IMPACT	There has been an upsurge of e-cigarette use in the United States in recent years. While e-cigarettes may contain lower levels of toxic chemicals than combusted cigarettes, they still pose serious health hazards, including increased risk for heart and respiratory disease. Despite these risks, public awareness of the health harms of e-cigarettes remains low. Thus, it is important to educate the public about the potential harms of e-cigarettes. This study took themes commonly found in antismoking messages and used them to develop messages about harms of e-cigarettes. A national sample of 2801 current smokers and nonsmokers (aged 18+ years) were randomized to view one of four e-cigarette messages (harmful effect of chemicals, uncertainty about ingredients, distrust of big tobacco, or cost of vaping) or a control message (bottled water ad). Participants' reactions to the messages and behavioral intentions were assessed immediately following the exposure. MANOVA examined effects of the messages on blocks of the outcome variables and univariate analyses estimated adjusted means for each experimental condition for each outcome. The message about harmful chemicals was perceived as the most informative and effective and elicited the highest levels of negative emotions (Ps<0.05). However, on measures of actual effectiveness, the other messages performed equally well. Specifically, messages with different themes (harmful chemicals, uncertainty about ingredients, anti-industry, or financial cost) increased perceived risk of e-cigarettes, support for e-cigarette control, and lowered self-exempting beliefs and intentions to use e-cigarettes (Ps<0.05). Themes commonly used in anti-smoking messages may be effective in educating the public about the potential harm of e-cigarettes. The observed differential effects of the messages suggest the need to use multiple themes in a public education campaign about e-cigarettes.

A total of 18629 unique peptides were identified in Uniprot, corresponding to 3,662 proteins. Among them, 383 and 409 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified from comparison between DR vs AL at day 7 and 42, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that membrane-related processes, post-transcriptional processes, spliceosome and reproduction related processes, were highlighted significantly. In addition, expression of proteins involved in pathways such as spliceosomes, oxidative phosphorylation, lysosomes, ubiquitination, and riboflavin metabolism was relatively higher during DR. A relatively large number of DEPs were found to participate in longevity and age-related disease pathways. We identified 20 proteins that were consistently regulated during DR and some of which are known to be involved in ageing, such as mTORC1, antioxidant, DNA damage repair and autophagy. In the integration analysis, we found 15 genes that were stably regulated by DR at both transcriptional as well as translational levels. Our results provided a useful dataset for further investigations on the mechanism of DR and aging.

J	Mtshali, S; Mahomed, O				Mtshali, Sifiso; Mahomed, Ozayr			Patient-level predictors of diabetes-related lower extremity amputations at a quaternary hospital in South Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; CARE; MELLITUS	Introduction Diabetes-related lower extremity amputation has a major psycho-social and economic cost on the patient as well as a direct impact on financial expenditure within health facilities. Aim This study aimed to determine the incidence and patient-related factors related to diabetes-related amputations amongst patients that were referred to the quaternary hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. Methods A retrospective cohort study. Data were retrieved from the medical record for each diabetes patient that was managed at IALCH during the study period. The following variables were collected: sociodemographic parameters (age, gender, and ethnicity) and diabetes-related parameters (type of diabetes) and additional complications. Results Ninety-nine patients (0, 73%) of all diabetes patients managed were new diabetes-related lower-extremity amputations. There were statistically significant increased odds of female patients (OR: 1, 7) and patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes (OR: 1, 64) to have new diabetes-related amputations. Patients older than 60 years (OR: 1, 31); African patients (OR: 1, 35) patients with cardiovascular complications (OR: 1, 04) and patients with retinopathy (OR: 1, 48) were more likely to have diabetes-related amputations but not statistically significant. Conclusions A combination of primary preventive strategies, early detection and appropriate management of patients with diabetes and specific guidelines on the frequency, clinical and laboratory tests required for early diagnosis and referrals with early signs of diabetes-related complicationsat primary care level will assist in reducing the long term adverse outcomes including amputations.

Comparative MD simulations and advanced analytics based studies on wild-type and hot-spot mutant A59G HRas	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAP-CATALYZED-HYDROLYSIS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; GTP HYDROLYSIS; CONFORMATIONAL DYNAMICS; RAS PROTEIN; STATE; ACTIVATION; MUTATIONS; MECHANISM; COMPLEX	The Ras family of proteins is known to play an important role in cellular signal transduction. The oncoprotein Ras is also found to be mutated in similar to 90% of the pancreatic cancers, of which G12V, G13V, A59G and Q61L are the known hot-spot mutants. These ubiquitous proteins fall in the family of G-proteins, and hence switches between active GTP bound and inactive GDP bound states, which is hindered in most of its oncogenic mutant counterparts. Moreover, Ras being a GTPase has an intrinsic property to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, which is obstructed due to mutations and lends the mutants stuck in constitutively active state leading to oncogenic behavior. In this regard, the present study aims to understand the dynamics involved in the hot-spot mutant A59G-Ras using long 10 mu s classical MD simulations (5 mu s for each of the wild-type and mutant systems) and comparing the same with its wild-type counterpart. Advanced analytics using Markov State Model (MSM) based approach has been deployed to comparatively understand the transition path for the wild-type and mutant systems. Roles of crucial residues like Tyr32, Gln61 and Tyr64 have also been established using multivariate PCA analyses. Furthermore, this multivariate PCA analysis also provides crucial features which may be used as reaction coordinates for biased simulations for further studies. The absence of formation of pre-hydrolysis network is also reported for the mutant conformation, using the distance-based analyses (between crucial residues) of the conserved regions. The implications of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the disruption of the pre-hydrolysis network in the mutant A59G ensemble might lead to permanently active oncogenic conformation in the mutant conformers.

Higher doses (up to 720 mu g) have been reported to optimize hyperaemic stimuli in small dose-response studies. Real-world data from a large cohort of patients is needed to evaluate FFR results and the safety of high-dose escalation. This is a retrospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and frequency of FFR <= 0.8 after high-dose escalation of intracoronary adenosine. Data were extracted from the medical databases of two university hospitals. Increasing doses (100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mu g) of adenosine were administered as intracoronary boluses until FFR <= 0.8 was achieved or heart block developed. The percentage of FFR <= 0.8 after higher-dose escalation was compared with those at conventional doses, and the predictors for FFR <= 0.8 after higher doses were analysed. In the 1163 vessels of 878 patients, 402 vessels (34.6%) achieved FFR <= 0.8 at conventional doses and 623 vessels (53.6%) received high-dose escalation. An additional 84 vessels (13.5%) achieved FFR <= 0.8 after high-dose escalation. No major complications developed during high-dose escalation. Borderline FFR (0.81-0.85) at the conventional dose, stenosis >60%, and triple-vessel disease increased the likelihood of FFR <= 0.8 after high-dose escalation, but chronic kidney disease decreased it. For vessels of borderline FFR at conventional doses, 46% achieved FFR <= 0.8 after high-dose escalation. In conclusion, High-dose escalation of intracoronary adenosine increases the frequency of FFR <= 0.8 without major complications. It could be especially feasible for borderline FFR values near the 0.8 diagnostic threshold.

Drug-safety reporting in Polish nursing practice-Cross sectional surveys	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTITUDES; NURSES	Introduction Nurses play a significant role in ensuring the safety and quality of drugs. Our aim was to assess significant factors in nurses' participation in ensuring pharmacotherapy safety by reporting adverse drug reactions (ADR) and detecting substandard drugs (SD). Materials and methods The study was a cross-sectional, comparative survey, using original questionnaires. Survey questions were grouped to probe the opinions, attitudes and practices of nurses reporting ADRs and SDs. Data were obtained from nurses working in teaching hospitals in Poland (group A) and, for comparison, in the USA (group B). 1200 questionnaires were distributed in Poland (return rate: 55.7%) and 200 questionnaires in the USA (return rate: 73%). Both groups were surveyed during the same period. There were no exclusion criteria. The questionnaires were self-administered. Distribution and collection were anonymous. Participation was voluntary. The Spearman correlation test was used. Both groups' responses were cross-tabulated and compared using Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data. Results The study group comprised 669 Polish and 146 American professionally active nurses working in general care and surgical departments. Age range: 18 to 72 years. Median job seniority: 18.3 years (group A) and 20.6 years (group B). Education levels varied. ADR reporting conditions in Poland are unfavorable: shortage of time-83.9% vs 22.6% in the US (p = 0.01); no incentive-58.2% vs 6.1% in the US (p = 0.01); and no equipment-44.7% vs 2.8% in the US (p < 0.01). Both Polish and American nurses indicate they rarely report SDs, with rates of 0.4% and 11% (p < 0.0001) respectively, during the study period. Conclusions Nurses in Poland are insufficiently prepared to ensure drug safety conscientiously and responsibly. Training is required for Polish nurses. Nurses' employers need to improve conditions to enable reporting of ADRs and SDs.

J	Doukyu, N; Ishikawa, M				Doukyu, Noriyuki; Ishikawa, Makoto			Cholesterol oxidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis with high specificity toward beta-cholestanol and pytosterols	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ORGANIC-SOLVENT; SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; EXPRESSION; PURIFICATION; PEROXIDATION; CLONING	Two genes (choRI and choRII) encoding cholesterol oxidases belonging to the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) family were cloned on the basis of putative cholesterol oxidase gene sequences in the genome sequence data of Rhodococcus erythropolis PR4. The genes corresponding to the mature enzymes were cloned in a pET vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The two cholesterol oxidases produced from the recombinant E. coli were purified to examine their properties. The amino acid sequence of ChoRI showed significant similarity (57%) to that of ChoRII. ChoRII was more stable than ChoRI in terms of pH and thermal stability. The substrate specificities of these enzymes differed distinctively from one another. Interestingly, the activities of ChoRII toward beta-cholestanol, beta-sitosterol, and stigmasterol were 2.4-, 2.1-, and 1.7-fold higher, respectively, than those of cholesterol. No cholesterol oxidases with high activity toward these sterols have been reported so far. The cholesterol oxidation products from these two enzymes also differed.

Directionally dependent multi-view clustering using copula model	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; INTEGRATED ANALYSIS; LONGITUDINAL DATA; BREAST; JOINT; OMICS	Recent developments in high-throughput methods have resulted in the collection of high-dimensional data types from multiple sources and technologies that measure distinct yet complementary information. Integrated clustering of such multiple data types or multi-view clustering is critical for revealing pathological insights. However, multi-view clustering is challenging due to the complex dependence structure between multiple data types, including directional dependency. Specifically, genomics data types have pre-specified directional dependencies known as the central dogma that describes the process of information flow from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) and then from mRNA to protein. Most of the existing multi-view clustering approaches assume an independent structure or pair-wise (non-directional) dependence between data types, thereby ignoring their directional relationship. Motivated by this, we propose a biology-inspired Bayesian integrated multi-view clustering model that uses an asymmetric copula to accommodate the directional dependencies between the data types. Via extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the negative impact of ignoring directional dependency on clustering performance. We also present an application of our model to a real-world dataset of breast cancer tumor samples collected from The Cancer Genome Altas program and provide comparative results.

Prediction of severity and subtype of fibrosing disease using model informed by inflammation and extracellular matrix gene index	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYSTEMIC-SCLEROSIS; DERMAL FIBROBLASTS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; SKIN-DISEASE; CHEMOKINE; DIFFUSE; RECEPTOR; ASSOCIATION; MATRIX-METALLOPROTEINASE-9; METALLOPROTEINASES	Fibrosis is a chronic disease with heterogeneous clinical presentation, rate of progression, and occurrence of comorbidities. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc) is a rare rheumatic autoimmune disease that encompasses several aspects of fibrosis, including highly variable fibrotic manifestation and rate of progression. The development of effective treatments is limited by these variabilities. The fibrotic response is characterized by both chronic inflammation and extracellular remodeling. Therefore, there is a need for improved understanding of which inflammation-related genes contribute to the ongoing turnover of extracellular matrix that accompanies disease. We have developed a multi-tiered method using Naive Bayes modeling that is capable of predicting level of disease and clinical assessment of patients based on expression of a curated 60-gene panel that profiles inflammation and extracellular matrix production in the fibrotic disease state. Our novel modeling design, incorporating global and parametric-based methods, was highly accurate in distinguishing between severity groups, highlighting the importance of these genes in disease. We refined this gene set to a 12-gene index that can accurately identify SSc patient disease state subsets and informs knowledge of the central regulatory pathways in disease progression.

A national cross-sectional survey of public perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic: Self-reported beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; OUTBREAK; HEALTH; FEAR; SARS	Introduction Efforts to mitigate the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) have largely relied on broad compliance with public health recommendations yet navigating the high volume of evolving information can be challenging. We assessed self-reported public perceptions related to COVID-19 including, beliefs (e.g., severity, concerns, health), knowledge (e.g., transmission, information sources), and behaviors (e.g., physical distancing) to understand perspectives in Canada and to inform future public health initiatives. Methods We administered a national online survey aiming to obtain responses from 2000 adults in Canada. Respondent sampling was stratified by age, sex, and region. We used descriptive statistics to summarize responses and tested for regional differences using chi-squared tests, followed by weighted logistic regression. Results We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26(th) and May 1(st), 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% reported self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified associations between region and self-reported beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Discussion We found that information about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general public's overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics.

However, its prognostic ability remains unclear in elderly HF patients. Methods and results From July 2014 to July 2018, patients hospitalized for HF were prospectively recruited at 16 centers. Clinical features, laboratory findings, and echocardiography results were assessed prior to discharge. Cardiovascular (CV) death and HF re-hospitalization were recorded. Of the 676 patients enrolled, 264 (39.1%) experienced CV events throughout a 1-year median follow-up period. Patients with high MELD-XI were predominantly male and had a higher prevalence of NYHA III/IV, history of HF admission, hyperuricemia, ventricular tachycardia, anemia, and ischemic heart disease. In Kaplan-Meyer analysis, patients with higher MELD-XI (>= 11) scores showed a worse prognosis than did those with lower (<11) scores (log-rank p <= 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards testing revealed MELD-XI as an independent predictor of CV events (HR: 1.033, 95% CI: 1.006-1.061, p = 0.015) after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, NYHA III/IV, prior HF hospitalization, systolic blood pressure, ischemic etiology, ventricular tachycardia, anemia, BNP, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusions Cardio-renal and cardio-hepatic interactions predicted CV events in aged HF patients.

Here, we have used RNA-seq to examine the transcriptome of whole brain in 40 of the LXS strains 8 hours after a saline or ethanol "pretreatment" as in previous behavioral studies. Approximately 1/3 of the 14,184 expressed genes were significantly heritable and many were unique to the pretreatment. Several thousand cis- and trans-eQTLs were mapped; a portion of these also were unique to pretreatment. Ethanol pretreatment caused differential expression (DE) of 1,230 genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggested involvement in numerous biological processes including astrocyte differentiation, histone acetylation, mRNA splicing, and neuron projection development. Genetic correlation analysis identified hundreds of genes that were correlated to the behaviors. GO analysis indicated that these genes are involved in gene expression, chromosome organization, and protein transport, among others. The expression profiles of the DE genes and genes correlated to AFT in the ethanol pretreatment group (AFT-Et) were found to be similar to profiles of HDAC inhibitors. Hdac1, a cis-regulated gene that is located at the peak of a previously mapped QTL for AFT-Et, was correlated to 437 genes, most of which were also correlated to AFT-Et. GO analysis of these genes identified several enriched biological process terms including neuron-neuron synaptic transmission and potassium transport. In summary, the results suggest widespread genetic effects on gene expression, including effects that are pretreatment-specific. A number of candidate genes and biological functions were identified that could be mediating the behavioral responses. The most prominent of these was Hdac1 which may be regulating genes associated with glutamatergic signaling and potassium conductance.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOW SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH; RISK; ASSOCIATION; OUTCOMES	Background The environment in which a patient lives influences their health outcomes. However, the degree to which community factors are associated with readmissions is uncertain. Objective To estimate the influence of community factors on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services risk-standardized hospital-wide readmission measure (HWR)-a quality performance measure in the U.S. Research design We assessed 71 community variables in 6 domains related to health outcomes: clinical care; health behaviors; social and economic factors; the physical environment; demographics; and social capital. Subjects Medicare fee-for-service patients eligible for the HWR measure between July 2014-June 2015 (n = 6,790,723). Patients were linked to community variables using their 5-digit zip code of residence. Methods We used a random forest algorithm to rank variables for their importance in predicting HWR scores. Variables were entered into 6 domain-specific multivariable regression models in order of decreasing importance. Variables with P-values <0.10 were retained for a final model, after eliminating any that were collinear. Results Among 71 community variables, 19 were retained in the 6 domain models and in the final model. Domains which explained the most to least variance in HWR were: physical environment (R-2 = 15%); clinical care (R-2 = 12%); demographics (R-2 = 11%); social and economic environment (R-2 = 7%); health behaviors (R-2 = 9%); and social capital (R-2 = 8%). In the final model, the 19 variables explained more than a quarter of the variance in readmission rates (R-2 = 27%). Conclusions Readmissions for a wide range of clinical conditions are influenced by factors relating to the communities in which patients reside. These findings can be used to target efforts to keep patients out of the hospital.

However, there are no data about how the COVID-19 epidemic influenced the treatment of OHCA victims. Methods We performed an analysis of the Lombardia Cardiac Arrest Registry comparing all the OHCAs occurred in the Provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia and Mantua (northern Italy) in the first 100 days of the epidemic with those occurred in the same period in 2019. Results The OHCAs occurred were 694 in 2020 and 520 in 2019. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate was lower in 2020 (20% vs 31%, p<0.001), whilst the rate of bystander automated external defibrillator (AED) use was similar (2% vs 4%, p = 0.11). Resuscitation was attempted by EMS in 64.5% of patients in 2020 and in 72% in 2019, whereof 45% in 2020 and 64% in 2019 received ALS. At univariable analysis, the presence of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 was not a predictor of resuscitation attempt. Age, unwitnessed status, non-shockable presenting rhythm, absence of bystander CPR and EMS arrival time were independent predictors of ALS attempt. No difference regarding resuscitation duration, epinephrine and amiodarone administration, and mechanical compression device use were highlighted. The return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate at hospital admission was lower in the general population in 2020 [11% vs 20%, p = 0.001], but was similar in patients with ALS initiated [19% vs 26%, p = 0.15]. Suspected/confirmed COVID-19 was not a predictor of ROSC at hospital admission. Conclusion Compared to 2019, during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak we observed a lower attitude of laypeople to start CPR, while resuscitation attempts by BLS and ALS staff were not influenced by suspected/confirmed infection, even at univariable analysis.

However, the altitudinal pattern of biomass allocation in mountainous shrubs and its responses to climate change are still unclear. In this study, biomass accumulation and allocation of the shrub community and their relationships with climatic factors were investigated in 331 sampling sites along an extensive altitudinal gradient (311-4911 m) in Southwest China. The results showed that the above-ground biomass (AGB) and the total biomass (TB) of the shrub community decreased quadratically (R-2= 0.107) and linearly (R-2= 0.024) from 9.86 to 0.15 kg center dot m(-2)and 15.61 to 0.26 kg center dot m(-2)with increasing altitude, respectively. However, the below-ground biomass (BGB) and TB of the herb layer increased quadratically with increasing altitudes (R-2= 0.136 and 0.122, respectively.P<0.001). The root/shoot ratio (R/S) of the community and its component synusiae increased gradually with increasing altitudes (P<0.001). The standardized major axis (SMA) indicated an isometric relationship between AGB and BGB for the whole shrub community, but allometric relationships were found for the shrub and herb layer. Redundancy analysis and Pearson correlation analysis showed that the biomass and R/S were significantly correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP) and reconnaissance drought index (RDI). These findings indicate that shrub biomass allocation is strongly affected by the altitude, MAT and MAP and support the isometric relationship of AGB and BGB partitioning at the community level on mountainous shrub biomes.

Superficial capillary perfusion on optical coherence tomography angiography differentiates moderate and severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FOVEAL AVASCULAR ZONE; RETINAL PLEXUSES; OCT ANGIOGRAPHY; QUANTIFICATION; CORRELATE; DENSITY	Purpose To identify objective optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) parameters that characterize the spectrum of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), especially those that distinguish moderate from severe NPDR. Methods Sixty eyes of 60 patients with treatment-naive NPDR (mild: 21, moderate: 21, severe: 18), 23 eyes with diabetes and no retinopathy, and 24 healthy control eyes were enrolled. OCTA slabs were segmented into superficial (SCP), middle (MCP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP) and thresholded by a new method based on DCP skeletonized vessel length. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, parafoveal vessel density (VD), and adjusted flow index (AFI) from all three capillary layers and the vessel length density (VLD) of the SCP were compared between each severity group, after adjusting for age and image quality. Results All vessel density markers decreased with increasing severity of NPDR. SCP VD and VLD demonstrated significant differences between eyes with diabetes with no retinopathy and mild NPDR (p= 0.001 andp< 0.001, respectively), as well as between moderate vs. severe NPDR (p= 0.004 andp= 0.009, respectively). MCP VD significantly decreased between moderate and severe NPDR (p= 0.01). AFI significantly increased in the SCP and showed a decreasing trend in the MCP and DCP with increasing NPDR severity. Conclusions Changes in the SCP VD, SCP VLD, and MCP VD can distinguish severe NPDR from lower-risk stages. SCP changes may be more reliable due to their lower susceptibility to noise and projection artifacts. Thresholding OCTA images based on DCP skeletonized vessel length showed less variability in moderate and severe NPDR. Additional studies are warranted to validate this new thresholding method.

Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of 72 eyes with BRAO of 72 patients. For statistical comparison, we divided the patients into worse-VA (decimal VA < 0.5) and better-VA (decimal VA > = 0.5) groups. We examined the association of clinical findings, including blood biochemical test data and carotid artery ultrasound parameters, with poor VA. Results Median age, hematocrit, hemoglobin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) differed significantly between the groups (P= 0.018,P< 0.01,P< 0.01, andP= 0.025). There was a tendency towards higher median IMT-Bmax in the worse-VA group (worse-VA vs. better-VA: 2.70 mm vs. 1.60 mm,P= 0.152). Spearman's rank correlation test revealed that logMAR VA was significantly correlated to IMT-Bmax (rs = 0.31,P< 0.01) and IMT-Cmax (rs = 0.24,P= 0.035). Furthermore, logMAR VA was significantly correlated to HDL level (rs = -0.33,P< 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IMT-Bmax (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70,P= 0.049), HDL level (OR = 0.91,P= 0.032), and female gender (OR = 15.63,P= 0.032) were independently associated with worse VA in BRAO. Conclusions We found that increased IMT-Bmax, decreased HDL, and female sex were associated with poor VA in BRAO patients. Our findings might suggest novel risk factors for visual dysfunction in BRAO and may provide new insights into the pathomechanisms underlying BRAO.

J	Johnson, SU; Ebrahimi, OV; Hoffart, A				Johnson, Sverre Urnes; Ebrahimi, Omid V.; Hoffart, Asle			PTSD symptoms among health workers and public service providers during the COVID-19 outbreak	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME; PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT; HOSPITAL WORKERS; RISK-FACTORS; TRAUMA; SARS	In the frontline of the pandemic stand healthcare workers and public service providers, occupations which have proven to be associated with increased mental health problems during pandemic crises. This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected data from 1773 healthcare workers and public service providers throughout Norway between March 31, 2020 and April 7, 2020, which encompasses a timeframe where all non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) were held constant. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression were assessed by the Norwegian version of the PTSD checklist (PCL-5), General Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ- 9), respectively. Health anxiety and specific predictors were assessed with specific items. Multiple regression analysis was used for predictor analysis. A total of 28.9% of the sample had clinical or subclinical symptoms of PTSD, and 21.2% and 20.5% were above the established cut-offs for anxiety and depression. Those working directly in contrast to indirectly with COVID-19 patients had significantly higher PTSD symptoms. Worries about job and economy, negative metacognitions, burnout, health anxiety and emotional support were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, after controlling for demographic variables and psychological symptoms. Health workers and public service providers are experiencing high levels of PTSD symptoms, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health workers working directly with COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of PTSD symptoms and depression compared to those working indirectly. Appropriate action to monitor and reduce PTSD, anxiety, and depression among these groups of individuals working in the frontline of pandemic with crucial societal roles should be taken immediately.

J	Minguet, EG				Minguet, Eugenio Gomez			Ares-GT: Design of guide RNAs targeting multiple genes for CRISPR-Cas experiments	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOOL	Guide RNA design for CRISPR genome editing of gene families is a challenging task as usually good candidate sgRNAs are tagged with low scores precisely because they match several locations in the genome, thus time-consuming manual evaluation of targets is required. To address this issues, I have developed ARES-GT, a Python local command line tool compatible with any operative system. ARES-GT allows the selection of candidate sgRNAs that match multiple input query sequences, in addition of candidate sgRNAs that specifically match each query sequence. It also contemplates the use of unmapped contigs apart from complete genomes thus allowing the use of any genome provided by user and being able to handle intraspecies allelic variability and individual polymorphisms. ARES-GT is available at GitHub (https://github.com/eugomin/ARES-GT.git).				mingueteg@gmail.com						Aliaga-Franco N, 2019, FRONT PLANT SCI, V10, DOI 10.3389/fpls.2019.01150; [Anonymous], 2014, REG ANESTH PAIN MED; [Anonymous], 2017, EUR GERIATR MED, V8, pS98; [Anonymous], 2016, NUCL ACIDS RES, V44, pD7; Bae S, 2014, BIOINFORMATICS, V30, P1473, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu048; Cong L, 2013, SCIENCE, V339, P819, DOI 10.1126/science.1231143; Doench JG, 2016, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V34, P184, DOI 10.1038/nbt.3437; Gan X, 2016, NAT PLANTS, V2, DOI [10.1038/NPLANTS.2016.167, 10.1038/nplants.2016.167]; Haake V, 2002, PLANT PHYSIOL, V130, P639, DOI 10.1104/pp.006478; Haeussler M, 2016, GENOME BIOL, V17, DOI 10.1186/s13059-016-1012-2; Heigwer F, 2014, NAT METHODS, V11, P122, DOI 10.1038/nmeth.2812; Hsu PD, 2013, NAT BIOTECHNOL, V31, P827, DOI 10.1038/nbt.2647; Jiao W-B, 2019, BIORXIV, P738880, DOI [10.1101/738880, DOI 10.1101/738880]; Keough KC, 2019, GENOME BIOL, V20, DOI 10.1186/s13059-019-1783-3; Labun K, 2019, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V47, pW171, DOI 10.1093/nar/gkz365; Larkin MA, 2007, BIOINFORMATICS, V23, P2947, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm404; Lei Y, 2014, MOL PLANT, V7, P1494, DOI 10.1093/mp/ssu044; Liu H, 2017, MOL PLANT, V10, P530, DOI 10.1016/j.molp.2017.01.003; Bernabe-Orts JM, 2019, PLANT BIOTECHNOL J, V17, P1971, DOI 10.1111/pbi.13113; Pliatsika V, 2015, BIOL DIRECT, V10, DOI 10.1186/s13062-015-0035-z; Swarts DC, 2017, MOL CELL, V66, P221, DOI 10.1016/j.molcel.2017.03.016; Xie SB, 2014, PLOS ONE, V9, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0094496; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K, 2006, ANNU REV PLANT BIOL, V57, P781, DOI 10.1146/annurev.arplant.57.032905.105444; Zetsche B, 2015, CELL, V163, P759, DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038	24	1	1	1	2	PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE	SAN FRANCISCO	1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA	1932-6203			PLOS ONE	PLoS One	OCT 21	2020	15	10							e0241001	10.1371/journal.pone.0241001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241001			11	Multidisciplinary Sciences	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Science & Technology - Other Topics	OM3RJ	33085710	Green Submitted, gold, Green Published			2022-12-27	WOS:000585943400006

Reliable reference genes inH.oblitaare needed for qRT-PCR analysis. Therefore, we evaluated 13 reference genes under biotic and abiotic conditions. RefFinder provided a comprehensive stability ranking, and geNorm suggested the optimal number of reference genes for normalization.RPL13aandRPL18were the most suitable reference genes for developmental stages, tissues, and temperature treatments;RPL13aandRPS3were the most suitable for pesticide and photoperiod treatments;RPS18andRPL18were the most suitable for the two sexes. We validated the normalized results using odorant-binding protein genes as target genes in different tissues. Compared with the selected suitable reference genes, the expression ofOBP1in antennae, abdomen, and wings, andOBP2in antennae and wings were overestimated due to the instability ofACTb. These results identified several reliable reference genes inH.oblitafor normalization, and are valuable for future molecular studies.

Maternal concentrations of the placenta-associated proteins placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) have been identified as predictors for preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, both syndromes of placental dysfunction. We have proposed that low maternal circulating PlGF and increased sFlt-1 are general markers for syncytiotrophoblast stress, which increases at and beyond term, even in apparently uncomplicated pregnancies. Our aim was to establish circulating PlGF, sFlt-1, and sFlt-1/PlGF reference ranges in healthy post-term pregnancies (gestational week >= 40(+2)), comparing with healthy term pregnancies and evaluating associations between time to delivery and biomarker percentiles. Methods Of 501 healthy, singleton post-term pregnancies prospectively recruited between September 2016 and December 2017 at our tertiary obstetric department, 426 with an uncomplicated delivery outcome contributed PlGF and sFlt-1 serum concentrations for reference range construction. A retrospective, cross-sectional, term group with an uncomplicated delivery outcome (n = 146) served as comparison. Differences in percentile values between groups and confidence intervals were calculated by quantile regression. Results In post-term pregnancies the 5(th), 50(th), and 95(th)percentiles for PlGF were: 70, 172, and 496 pg/mL; for sFlt-1: 2074, 4268, and 9141 pg/mL; and for sFlt-1/PlGF 5.3, 25.5, and 85.2. Quantile regression analyses comparing the post-term to the term group showed for PlGF a trend towards higher 10(th)through 30(th)percentiles, for sFlt-1 significantly higher 10(th)through 80(th)percentiles, and for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio significantly higher 30(th)percentile and significantly lower 95(th)percentile. PlGF below the 5(th)percentile and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio above the 95(th)percentile was associated with shorter time to delivery (p = 0.031 and p = 0.025, respectively). Conclusions Our findings support the concept of increasing syncytiotrophoblast stress post-term in clinically healthy pregnancies. Whether post-term dysregulated angiogenic markers reflect a biological placental clock merits further investigation.

We conducted a retrospective study using Zimbabwe ART program data to assess the association between "Treat All" and, patient-mix, programmatic characteristics, retention and predictors of attrition. Methods We used patient-level data from the electronic patient monitoring system (ePMS) from the nine districts, which piloted the "Treat All" recommendation. We compared patient-mix, programme characteristics, retention and predictors of attrition (lost to follow-up, death or stopping ART) in two cohorts; before (April/May 2016) and after (January/February 2017) "Treat All". Retention was estimated using survival analysis. Predictors of attrition were determined using a multivariable Cox regression model. Interactions were used to assess the change in predictors of attrition before and after "Treat All". Results We analysed 3787 patients, 1738 (45.9%) and 2049 (54.1%) started ART before and after "Treat All", respectively. The proportion of men was higher after "Treat All" (39.4.% vs 36.2%, p = 0.044). Same-day ART initiation was more frequent after "Treat All" (43.2% vs 16.4%; p<0.001) than before. Retention on ART was higher before "Treat All" (p<0.001). Among non-pregnant women and men, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of attrition after compared to before "Treat All" was 1.73 (95%CI: 1.30-2.31). The observed hazard of attrition for women being pregnant at ART initiation decreased by 17% (aHR: 1.73*0.48 = 0.83) after "Treat All". Being male (vs female; aHR: 1.45; 95%CI: 1.12-1.87) and WHO Stage IV (vs WHO Stage I-III; aHR: 2.89; 95%CI: 1.16-7.11) predicted attrition both before and after "Treat All" implementation. Conclusion Attrition was higher after "Treat All"; being male, WHO Stage 4, and pregnancy predicted attrition in both before and after Treat All. However, pregnancy became a less strong risk factor for attrition after "Treat All" implementation.

This study aimed to evaluate the rate of smoking cessation, smoking relapse and related factors in middle-aged and older smokers in China. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) that recruited a nationally representative sample of adults aged 45 and older. Participants were 3708 smokers in 2011 who completed two waves of follow-up interviews in 2013 and 2015. Self-reported quit and relapse rates at follow-ups were estimated. Multiple logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with smoking cessation and relapse. Results The overall quit rate was 8.5% (95% CI 7.7% - 9.5%) at the 2-year follow-up in 2013, and 16.6% (95% CI 15.5% - 17.9%) at the 4-year follow up. Smoking cessation in 2013 was associated with not living in the northeast region (p = 0.003), fewer cigarettes smoked daily (p<0.001), and longer time to the first cigarette in the morning (p<0.001). Smoking cessation in 2015 was associated with older age (p = 0.049), smoking initiation at age >= 20 years (p<0.001), longer time to the first cigarette in the morning (p<0.001), and self-perceived poor health (p<0.001). Of the 317 participants who stopped smoking in 2013, 13.3% (95% CI 9.9% - 17.5%) relapsed by 2015. Smoking relapse was associated with younger age (p = 0.025), shorter time to the first cigarette in the morning (p = 0.003), and self-perception of not poor health (p = 0.018). Conclusion The overall quit rate was 8.5% at the 2-year follow up, and 16.6% at the 4-year follow up in the middle-aged and older smokers, but 13% of quitters returned to smoking in two years. Successful smoking cessation was associated with older age, lower nicotine dependence, and self-perceived poor health.

A common animal model used to study different facets of psychiatric disorders is social isolation from early life on. In rats, this isolation can induce long-lasting alterations in molecular expression and in behavior. Since social isolation models severe psychiatric symptoms, it is to be expected that it affects the overall wellbeing of the animals. As also promoted by the 3Rs principle, though, it is pivotal to decrease the burden of laboratory animals by limiting the number of subjects (reduce, replace) and by improving the animals' wellbeing (refine). The aim of this study was therefore to test possible refinement strategies such as resocialization and mere adult social isolation. We examined whether the alternatives still triggered the necessary phenotype while minimizing the stress load on the animals. Interestingly, we did not find reduced wellbeing-associated burrowing performance in isolated rats. The hyperactive phenotype seen in socially isolated animals was observed for rats undergoing the adult-only isolation, but resocializing ameliorated the locomotor abnormality. Isolation strongly affected markers of neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex independent of timing: mRNA levels of Arc, Bdnf and the pool of Bdnf transcripts with the 3' long UTR were reduced in all groups. Bdnf splice variant IV expression was reduced in lifelong-isolated animals. Some of these deficits normalized after resocialization; likewise, exon VI Bdnf mRNA levels were reduced only in animals persistently isolated. Conversely, social deprivation did not affect the expression of Gad67 and Pvb, two GABAergic markers, whereas changes occurred in the expression of dopamine d1 and d2 receptors. As adult isolation was sufficient to trigger the hyperactive phenotype and impaired neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex, it could be a candidate for a refinement strategy for certain research questions. To fully grade the severity of post-weaning social isolation and the alternatives, adult isolation and resocialization, a more profound and multimodal assessment approach is necessary.

Prevalence of multimorbidity in the Cypriot population; A cross-sectional study (2018-2019)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY; CHRONIC DISEASES; PRIMARY-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PATTERNS; CYPRUS; ADULTS	Background Multimorbidity is defined as the co-existence of two or more chronic conditions. As life expectancy is increasing so does the prevalence of multimorbidity. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity in Cyprus and identify the most prevalent diseases. Methods A representative sample of n = 1140 individuals over 18 years old was surveyed during 2018-2019. Demographic characteristics as well as the presence of chronic conditions, including mental disorders, were collected through a standardized questionnaire. Diseases were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10(th) Revision (ICD-10). Results The age and gender standardized prevalence of multimorbidity was 28.6%. Multimorbidity was associated with age (p<0.001), with the highest rate observed among people aged 65+ years old (68.9%). Multimorbidity was higher in women than men (28.2% vs. 22.5%, p < .001) but similar in urban and rural regions (26.4% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.395). The most prevalent chronic diseases among people with multimorbidity were hyperlipidemia (44.7%), followed by hypertension (37.5%), gastric reflux (23.9%), and thyroid diseases (22.2%), while the most common combinations of diseases were in the circulatory and endocrine systems. The profile of the multimorbid individual indicated this to be a person at an older age with a higher BMI, a current smoker with a higher salary. Conclusions More than one quarter of the general population of Cyprus has multimorbidity, and this rate is almost 70% among the elderly. Multimorbidity is relatively common even in younger ages too. This underlines the need for prevention strategies and health awareness programs for the entire population.

J	Sikdar, S; Mukherjee, A; Marsili, M				Sikdar, Sandipan; Mukherjee, Animesh; Marsili, Matteo			Unsupervised ranking of clustering algorithms by INFOMAX	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VALIDATION; NETWORK	Clustering and community detection provide a concise way of extracting meaningful information from large datasets. An ever growing plethora of data clustering and community detection algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we address the question of ranking the performance of clustering algorithms for a given dataset. We show that, for hard clustering and community detection, Linsker's Infomax principle can be used to rank clustering algorithms. In brief, the algorithm that yields the highest value of the entropy of the partition, for a given number of clusters, is the best one. We show indeed, on a wide range of datasets of various sizes and topological structures, that the ranking provided by the entropy of the partition over a variety of partitioning algorithms is strongly correlated with the overlap with a ground truth partition The codes related to the project are available in https://github.com/Sandipan99/Ranking_cluster_algorithms.

Methods Study type: Monocentric retrospective cohort study. 249 eyes of 249 patients undergoing PPV due to epiretinal membrane (EM), idiopathic macular hole (IMH) or vitreoretinal traction (VT) were included. The fellow eye served as control. Exclusion criteria were factors known to influence the IOP, such as cataract surgery during follow-up, extended use of steroids, cryotherapy and silicone oil endotamponade. The relative change of IOP (operated vs. fellow eye) at 6-12 months after surgery was defined as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were the relative change of IOP at 3-6 and 12-24 months. Possible influencing cofactors were analysed using ANCOVA. Results The primary endpoint did not show a significant IOP reduction of the operated eye relative to the fellow eye (P = 0.089, n = 84). However, the IOP of the operated eye alone was significantly reduced at 6-12 and 12-24 months after surgery (-0.75 +/- 2.80 and -1.22 +/- 3.29 mmHg, P = 0.008 and 0.007, respectively). The IOP of the fellow eye was also significantly reduced at the 12-24 months period (-0.75 +/- 2.73 mmHg, P = 0.008). In the subgroup analysis, sclerotomy size was a significant influencing cofactor, leading to lower IOP after 20G compared to 23G vitrectomy (P = 0.04). Conclusion Pars plana vitrectomy did not induce a significant long-term IOP reduction relative to the contralateral eye. However, we observed a IOP lowering potential in 20G vitrectomy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in this response, but their expression pattern and their role as biomarkers in CAP have not been fully characterized. Methods A prospective observational study was performed in a cohort of 153 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with CAP. Clinical and analytical variables were collected, and the main outcome variable was 30-day mortality. Small RNA was purified from plasma of these patients obtained on the first day of admission, and miRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out through the construction of a logistic regression model. The proposed model was compared with established prognostic clinical scales using ROC curve analysis. Results The mean age of the patients included was 74.7 years [SD 15.9]. Their mean PSI was 100.9 [SD 34.6] and the mean modified Charlson index was 2.9 [SD 3.0]. Both miR-146a and miR-16-5p showed statistically significant association with 30-day mortality after admission due to CAP (1.10 vs. 0.23 and 51.74 vs. 35.23, respectively), and this association remained for miR-16-5p in the multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender and history of bronchoaspiration (OR 0.95, p = 0.021). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) of our adjusted multivariate model (AUC = 0.954 95%CI [0.91-0.99]), was better than those of prognostic scales such as PSI (AUC = 0.799 [0.69-0.91]) and CURB-65 (AUC = 0.722 [0.58-0.86]). Conclusions High levels of miR-146a-5p and miR-16-5p upon admission due to CAP are associated with lower mortality at 30 days of follow-up. Both miRNAs could be used as biomarkers of good prognosis in subjects hospitalized with CAP.

While other countries have already extended their vaccination guidelines to include boys, in 2019 the French National Authority for Health validated implementation of HPV vaccination in the 2020 vaccination schedule. There is, however, a climate of distrust in regard to vaccination in France, and there have been few studies to date regarding the acceptability of HPV vaccination in boys in France. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the acceptability of extending the recommendations for HPV vaccination in men, among middle and high school students and their parents. Methods Our study (HPVac) was a prospective, multicenter, departmental, and descriptive survey applied to a sample of male middle and high school students attending schools in the Loire-Atlantique department and their parents. It took place from January 2017 to January 2018. Results We analyzed the information obtained from 127 parent questionnaires and 145 children questionnaires. In terms of acceptability, 36.6% (n = 53) of the children and 37.8% (n = 48) of the parents were in favour of being vaccinated or of having their children vaccinated against HPV (51.7% (n = 75) and 50.4% (n = 64), respectively, were undecided). The perception of a risk stemming from HPV infection was positively associated with acceptability of the HPV vaccine. Being against vaccines in general, being discouraged by their parents, parents thinking that their child is not at risk, and the belief that the vaccine is not mandatory were arguments cited and significantly associated with a willingness to be vaccinated. Conclusion This study revealed a lack of information among boys and their parents about HPV and its vaccination. It also clearly showed that taking time to discuss the consequences of an infection and the merits of being vaccinated can help parents overcome their reluctance. The children then generally go along with their parent's choice.

We investigated the anticancer properties of Rg3 through myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) modulation in FM3A mouse mammary carcinoma cells. The effects of Rg3 on MDSCs and consequent changes in cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated by diverse methods. MDSCs promoted cancer by enhancing breast cancer stemness and promoting EMT. Rg3 at a dose without obvious cytotoxicity downregulated MDSCs and repressed MDSC-induced cancer stemness and EMT. Mechanistic investigations suggested that these inhibitory effects of Rg3 on MDSCs and corresponding cancer progression depend upon suppression of the STAT3-dependent pathway, tumor-derived cytokines, and the NOTCH signaling pathway. In a mouse model, MDSCs accelerated tumor progression, and Rg3 delayed tumor growth, which is consistent with the results ofin vitroexperiments. These results indicated that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the progression of breast cancer. The anticancer effect of Rg3 might be partially due to its downregulation of MDSCs and consequent repression of cancer stemness and EMT in breast cancer. Hence, we suggest the regulation of MDSCs through Rg3 treatment as an effective therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients.

J	Yang, H; Zhu, H; Fu, HM				Yang, Hui; Zhu, Hui; Fu, Haiming			Numerical calculation and analysis of filtration performance of an effective novel structural fiber for PM2.5	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CROSS-SECTIONAL SHAPE; DEPOSITION; COLLECTION; EFFICIENCY; FILTERS; NANOPARTICLES; OPTIMIZATION; DISPERSION; PARTICLES; MEMBRANES	In this study, a novel fiber with slit-crescent-shaped cross-section is proposed to enhance the filtration performance of PM(2.5)in fibrous filtration. The collection efficiency of this fiber is simulated by using a Brownian dynamics simulation technique, and its filtration pressure drop is obtained by numerically solving Navier-Stokes equation with Fluent software. A parametric study is performed to improve the optimum filtration performance of the slit-crescent-shaped fiber via adjusting its structural parameters (dimensionless center-to-center spacing and slit width). Results indicate that at the optimal condition, i.e., when dimensionless slit width ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, collection efficiency is enhanced by 13.1%-101.1% relative to the circular fiber for particles ranging from 0.1 mu m to 2.5 mu m for the slit-crescent-shaped fiber under various dimensionless center-to-center spacing, and filtration pressure drop is reduced by up to 14.4%. In addition, quality factor is introduced to evaluate the comprehensive filtration performance of the slit-crescent-shaped fiber with different structural parameters, and results show that large dimensionless slit width and small dimensionless center-to-center spacing lead to a much higher quality factor than the circular fiber, especially for particles lager than 0.5 mu m. The numerical results obtained in this work are conducive to designing high efficiency fibrous filters.

J	Green, MS; Peer, V; Schwartz, N; Nitzan, D				Green, Manfred S.; Peer, Victoria; Schwartz, Naama; Nitzan, Dorit			The confounded crude case-fatality rates (CFR) for COVID-19 hide more than they reveal-a comparison of age-specific and age-adjusted CFRs between seven countries	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background Crude case-fatality rates (CFRs) for COVID-19 vary widely between countries. There are serious limitations in the CFRs when making comparisons. We examined how the age distribution of the cases is responsible for the COVID-19 CFR differences between countries. Methods COVID-19 cases and deaths, by ten-year age-groups, were available from the reports of seven countries. The overall and age-specific CFRs were computed for each country. The age-adjusted CFRs were computed by the direct method, using the combined number of cases in all seven countries in each age group as the standard population. A meta-analytic approach was used to obtain pooled age-specific CFRs. Findings The crude overall CFRs varied between 0.82% and 14.2% in the seven countries and the variation in the age-specific CFRs were much smaller. There was wide variation in the age distribution of the cases between countries. The ratio of the crude CFR for the country with the highest CFR to that with the lowest (6.28) was much lower for the age-adjusted CFRs rates (2.57). Conclusions The age structure of the cases explains much of differences in the crude CFRs between countries and adjusting for age substantially reduces this variation. Other factors such as the definition of cases, coding of deaths and the standard of healthcare are likely to account for much of the residual variation. It is misleading to compare the crude COVID-19 CFRs between countries and should be avoided. At the very least, age-specific and age-adjusted CFRs should be used for comparisons.

F.			Occupational bladder cancer: A cross section survey of previous employments, tasks and exposures matched to cancer phenotypes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK; MORTALITY; METAANALYSIS	Objectives Up to 10% of Bladder Cancers may arise following occupational exposure to carcinogens. We hypothesised that different cancer phenotypes reflected different patterns of occupational exposure. Methods Consecutive participants, with bladder cancer, self-completed a structured questionnaire detailing employment, tasks, exposures, smoking, lifestyle and family history. Our primary outcome was association between cancer phenotype and occupational details. Results We collected questionnaires from 536 patients, of whom 454 (85%) participants (352 men and 102 women) were included. Women were less likely to be smokers (68% vs. 81% Chi sq. p<0.001), but more likely than men to inhale environmental tobacco smoke at home (82% vs. 74% p = 0.08) and use hair dye (56% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Contact with potential carcinogens occurred in 282 (62%) participants (mean 3.1 per worker (range 0-14)). High-grade cancer was more common than low-grade disease in workers from the steel, foundry, metal, engineering and transport industries (p<0.05), and in workers exposed to crack detection dyes, chromium, coal/oil/gas by-products, diesel fumes/fuel/aircraft fuel and solvents (such as trichloroethylene). Higher staged cancers were frequent in workers exposed to Chromium, coal products and diesel exhaust fumes/fuel (p<0.05). Various workers (e.g. exposed to diesel fuels or fumes (Cox, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.31-2.98) p = 0.001), employed in a garage (HR 2.19 (95% CI 1.31-3.63) p = 0.001), undertaking plumbing/gas fitting/ventilation (HR 2.15 (95% CI 1.15-4.01) p = 0.017), undertaking welding (HR 1.85 (95% CI 1.24-2.77) p = 0.003) and exposed to welding materials (HR 1.92 (95% CI 1.27-2.91) p = 0.002)) were more likely to have disease progression and receive radical treatment than others. Fewer than expected deaths were seen in healthcare workers (HR 0.17 (95% CI 0.04-0.70) p = 0.014). Conclusions We identified multiple occupational tasks and contacts associated with bladder cancer. There were some associations with phenotype, although our study design precludes robust assessment.	[Reed, Oliver; Jubber, Ibrahim; Goodwin, Louise; Cumberbatch, Marcus G.; Catto, James W.

Louise; Nadjm, Behzad			Purchase and use of antimicrobials in the hospital sector of Vietnam, a lower middle-income country with an emerging pharmaceuticals market	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTIBIOTIC CONSUMPTION	Introduction Antimicrobial use is associated with emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We report hospital antimicrobial procurement, as a surrogate for consumption in humans, expenditure and prices in public hospitals in Vietnam, a lower middle-income country with a high burden of drug resistant infections. Method Data on antimicrobial procurement were obtained from tender-winning bids from provincial health authorities and public hospitals with detailed bids representing 28.7% (1.68 / 5.85 billion US $) of total hospital medication spend in Vietnam. Antimicrobials were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Index and the 2019 WHO Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) groups. Volume was measured in number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD). Antimicrobial prices were presented per DDD. Results Expenditure on systemic antibacterials and antifungals accounted for 28.6% (US $482.6 million/US $1.68 billion) of the total drug bids. 83% of antibacterials (572,698,014 DDDs) by volume (accounting for 45.5% of the antibacterials spend) were domestically supplied. Overall, the most procured antibacterials by DDD were second generation cephalosporins, combinations of penicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors, and penicillins with extended spectrum. For parenteral antibacterials this was third generation cephalosporins. The average price for antibacterials was US $15.6, US $0.86, US $0.4 and US $11.7 per DDD for Reserve, Watch, Access and non-recommended/unclassified group antibacterials, respectively. Conclusions Antimicrobials accounted for a substantial proportion of the funds spent for medication in public hospitals in Vietnam. The pattern of antibacterial consumption was similar to other countries. The high prices of Reserve group and non-recommended/unclassified antibacterials suggests a need for a combination of national pricing and antimicrobial stewardship policies to ensure appropriate accessibility.

Without treatment, its mortality rate increases significantly. Terlipressin is considered to be the therapy of choice until the need of a liver transplant. The aim is to determine its prevalence, define patients' characteristics, triggers and 90-day survival, according to the type of managements established. Method This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Colombia. It included patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury who met hepatorenal syndrome criteria, reaching 28 patients from 2007 to 2015. Groups were categorized according the type of hepatorenal syndrome and treatment. Demographic and trigger factors were evaluated to characterize the population. Treatment outcomes with terlipressin vs norepinephrine were analyzed up to a 90-day survival, using log Rank test. Continuous variables needed Student's T and Mann Whitney's U tests and categorical variables, Chi2 test. A value of p Results 117 patients with cirrhosis developed renal injury; of these 23.9% were diagnosed with Hepatorenal Syndrome (67.8% type1; 32.1% type2). The presence of ascites was 100% in HRS2 and 84% in HRS1 (p = 0.296). The main trigger in both types was paracentesis greater than 5 liters in the last 4 weeks (39.3%). In total, 35% of the patients received renal replacement therapy and 14% underwent a hepatic transplant. Type 1 was more frequent (63% received terlipressin; 21% norepinephrine). The total complete response was 36% (Type2 66.6% vs. Type1 18.7%) (p = 0.026). In contrast, the overall mortality was of 67.8% at 90-day of follow-up (89.4% Type1 vs. 22% Type2) (p = <0.001). We found a lower mortality rate in patients treated with terlipressin than treated with norepinephrine (p = 0.006). Conclusion There is scarce clinical and epidemiological information about this condition in Colombia. A significant difference between the two drugs cannot be stipulated due to the limitation in the sample size of our study. The general mortality at a 90-day follow-up was high, being higher in patients with HRS1. While the results of this study are suggestive of clinical information for HRS patients in the Colombian population, they should also be interpreted with caution, therefore further multicenter studies should be performed.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the associations of visceral fat (VF) and CRF with the prevalence of pre-DM/DM among Japanese adults. The study included 970 individuals (327 women and 643 men) who were 40-87 years old and had complete health examinations, abdominal fat area, and fitness data from WASEDA'S Health Study during 2015-2018. The VF area was measured using magnetic resonance imaging. CRF was measured using a cycle ergometer and was defined as VO(2)peak divided by fat free mass. The pre-DM/DM was identified based on the questionnaire and fasting blood tests. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalence of pre-DM/DM were calculated. Seventy-three participants had pre-DM and 48 participants had DM. Compared to the low VF group, the high VF group had a higher prevalence of pre-DM/DM (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.18-2.96), although no significant relationship was observed between CRF and pre-DM/DM prevalence (Pfor trend = 0.239). The sub-group analyses also revealed no significant relationship between CRF and pre-DM/DM prevalence in the low VF group (Pfor trend = 0.979), although CRF values were inversely related to the prevalence of pre-DM/DM in the high VF group (Pfor trend = 0.024). Although CRF was not independently related to the prevalence of pre-DM/DM after adjusting for adiposity, higher VF values were related to a higher prevalence of pre-DM/DM. In addition, CRF levels were inversely associated with the prevalence of pre-DM/DM only among high VF individuals.

J	Cho, JY; Kook, H; Yu, CW				Cho, Jae Young; Kook, Hyungdon; Yu, Cheol Woong			Clinical impact of angiographically insignificant suboptimal poststent findings detected by optical coherence tomography after drug-eluting stent implantation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTRAVASCULAR ULTRASOUND; EDGE DISSECTIONS; NATURAL-HISTORY; THROMBOSIS; APPOSITION; PREDICTORS; OUTCOMES; PCI	Background Although optical coherence tomography (OCT)-detected suboptimal findings (SF-OCT) such as malapposition, edge dissection, tissue protrusion, thrombus and small minimal stent area (MSA) are frequently observed after the implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES), their clinical implications are controversial. Hypothesis Clinical outcomes may differ between patients with SF-OCTs and without SF-OCTs after DES implantation. Methods A total of 576 patients undergoing OCT analysis after DES implantation were divided into SF-OCT group (n = 379, 379 lesions) and No SF-OCT group (n = 197, 197 lesions). The study population had no significant abnormal finding in final angiography. Quantification was performed for each SF-OCT. The incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and stent thrombosis) were compared between the two groups. A median follow-up duration was 21.5 months. Results Among 379 patients with SF-OCT, 32.4% had multiple SF-OCTs. Malapposition (32.1%, IQR of maximal depth 315-580 mu m) was the most frequent, followed by small MSA (31.6%), edge dissection (12.5%, IQR of maximal flap of opening 0.27-0.52 mm), thrombus (7.6%, IQR of diameter 1.31-1.97mm) and tissue protrusion (6.8%, IQR of diameter 1.05-1.67 mm). The SF-OCT group showed smaller stent diameter and longer stent length, and lower in-stent lumen expansion rate. The incidence of MACE did not differ between the two groups (3.0% for No SF-OCT vs. 5.0% for SF-OCT; HR 1.601; 95% CI 0.639 to 4.011; P = 0.310). Conclusions The presence of angiographically insignificant SF-OCTs were not associated with clinical outcomes in this study.

J	Zhao, ZF; Du, L; Wang, DX				Zhao, Zi-Fang; Du, Lei; Wang, Dong-Xin			Effects of dexmedetomidine as a perineural adjuvant for femoral nerve block: A systematic review and meta-analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Review							TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; DOUBLE-BLIND; POSTOPERATIVE ANALGESIA; SLEEP QUALITY; REPLACEMENT; ROPIVACAINE; DEXAMETHASONE; BUPIVACAINE	Background Femoral nerve block (FNB) is one of the first-line analgesic methods for patients following lower extremity surgery. However, FNB with local anesthetics alone exert limited potency and supplemental opioids are often required. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been used to improve the analgesic effects of FNB. The present systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of DEX as an adjuvant to local anesthetics for FNB. Methods Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of DEX versus sham control in combination with local anesthetics for FNB were included in this meta-analysis. Postoperative pain scores, duration of analgesic effects, and postoperative narcotic consumption were outcomes of interest. This research was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements. Results A total of 9 studies encompassing 580 participants were included for data synthesis after critical evaluation. DEX as an adjuvant with local anesthetics for FNB significantly relieved pain intensity at 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery, both at rest (standardized mean difference -1.34 [95% CI -1.87 to -0.82], P<0.00001 at 12 h; -1.26 [-1.90 to -0.0.63], P<0.0001 at 24 h; and -1.34; [-2.18 to -0.50], P = 0.002 at 48 h) and with movement (-1.30 [-2.17 to -0.43], P = 0.004 at 12 h; -1.02 [-1.31 to -0.72], P<0.00001 at 24h; and -1.33 [-2.03 to -0.63], P = 0.0002); it also significantly prolonged analgesic duration (mean difference 7.23 h [95% CI 4.07 to 10.39], P<0.00001) and decreased opioid consumption (mean difference of morphine equivalent -12.13 mg [95% CI -23.36 to -0.89], P<0.00001). Regarding safety, DEX use increased the rate of hypotension (odds ratio 4.10, 95% CI 1.40 to 12.01, P = 0.01). Conclusion DEX as an adjuvant to local anesthetics for FNB improves analgesia, prolongs analgesic duration and reduces supplemental opioid consumption; but increases hypotension.

Neurobehavior of newborn infants exposed prenatally to methadone and identification of a neurobehavioral profile linked to poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 24 months	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME; PREGNANT-WOMEN; FOLLOW-UP; BUPRENORPHINE; CHILDREN; HEROIN; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT; COCAINE; MOTHERS	The abuse of prescription opioids and heroin by women of childbearing age over the past decade has resulted in a five-fold increase in the number of infants born opioid-dependent. Daily opioid substitution treatment with methadone is associated with less maternal illicit opioid use and improved antenatal care. However, research on the neurobehavioral effects of daily prenatal exposure to methadone on the infant is limited. Using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), we compared the neurobehavior at birth of 86 infants born to opioid-dependent mothers receiving methadone treatment (MMT) with 103 infants unexposed to methadone. Generalized linear models, adjusted for covariates, showed methadone exposed infants had significantly poorer attention, regulation, and quality of movement. They were also significantly more excitable, more easily aroused, exhibited more non-optimal reflexes, hypertonicity, and total signs of stress abstinence. Maternal MMT was also associated with more indices of neonatal abstinence, including: CNS, visual, genitourinary (GI), and state. Latent profile analysis of the NNNS summary scores revealed four distinct neurobehavioral profiles with infants characterized by the most disturbed neurobehavior at birth having the poorest clinical outcomes at birth, and poorer cognitive and motor development at 24 months of age.

While OH is usually diagnosed based on an orthostatic blood pressure drop, the association between the heart rate response and cognitive impairment remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 143 cases of clinically diagnosed PD to determine the association between the absence of a heart rate response and cognitive impairment in PD with OH. Among the patients with OH, neurogenic OH was diagnosed in cases without a heart rate increase, while all other patients were diagnosed with non-neurogenic OH. Dementia was found in 23 of 143 PD cases (16.1%) in this cohort. The presence of OH was an independent risk factor for dementia in PD in addition to the disease severity, years of education and beta-blockers use. Neurogenic OH was significantly associated with dementia compared to the no OH group (hazard ratio [HR] 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-24.6, P<0.01), an association that was preserved after adjusting for age, gender and other covariant factors. However, no such association was observed for non-neurogenic OH (HR 2.9, 95%CI 0.8-10.9, P = 0.12). While the cognitive impairment was significantly worse in the neurogenic OH group than the no-OH group, the groups were otherwise similar. The blood pressure decrease was significantly lower in both OH groups than in the no-OH group, despite no significant differences between the OH groups. Our finding showed that OH without a heart rate response was an important predictor of cognitive impairment in PD.

A total of 438 women from 24 national teams who participated at Canada 2015 (artificial turf) and 283 players from 16 national teams who played in Germany 2011 (natural grass) were selected for this study. The collected data were provided by OPTA Sports. Twenty-nine key performance indicators were included for analysis. The variables were calculated for the total sample and independently by positions (defense, midfielders and forwards) for matches on natural grass (2011) and artificial turf (2015). A Mann-Whitney U test was used out to identify differences between the sport surfaces. Moreover, a discriminant analysis was performed with the forced entry method to find the variables that better differentiated between the FIFA Women's World Cup 2011 (natural grass) and FIFA Women's World Cup 2015 (artificial turf). Key performance aspects were very similar between the two tournaments, but on natural grass, we observed a significantly higher number of total passes, successful dribbles, total tackles, successful tackles and interceptions. However, on artificial turf there were significantly higher percentages of success in total passes, and a higher number of fouls. This is an important factor for the choice of an elite competition surface because technical actions are crucial to the quality of the game and can influence the future behavior of spectators and fans.

J	Glennemeier, K; Packard, S; Spyreas, G				Glennemeier, Karen; Packard, Stephen; Spyreas, Greg			Dramatic long-term restoration of an oak woodland due to multiple, sustained management treatments	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FLORISTIC QUALITY ASSESSMENT; WHITE-TAILED DEER; PRAIRIE RESTORATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PLANT DIVERSITY; FOREST; FIRE; PERFORMANCE; GRASSLAND	We measured 34 years of plant community change in a degraded oak woodland undergoing ecological management. Management included regular prescribed fire, control of white-tailed deer populations, repeated sowing of a diverse seed mix, and removal of invasive plants. We tracked change with several conservation metrics. Time series analysis showed no significant changes over time in either plant species richness or the Shannon-Weiner diversity index. Floristic Quality Assessment measures-the Floristic Quality Index (FQI), Cover-weighted FQI, and the Mean Coefficient of Conservatism (Mean C)-all increased dramatically over time, such that their values now surpass those of the highest quality representative of this habitat in the region. Cover-weighted FQI had the added benefit of being quick to respond (negatively and positively) to short-term management changes during the study. This sensitivity highlights its utility for adaptive management, enabling timely, data-driven changes to ongoing management regimes. Plant community composition showed striking changes during the study period, as species of high conservation value replaced weedier species. As a group, conservative woodland species are notoriously slow to recover from degradation, making this flora's recovery particularly notable. A mid-study cessation of management immediately stalled the woodland's recovery according to Floristic Quality metrics, but the restoration quickly returned to its positive trajectory with the resumption of management treatments. These results illustrate that impressive plant biodiversity restoration can be achieved, even in highly degraded contemporary oak ecosystems, if ecological management is comprehensive and if it is sustained over time.

J	Sheftel, CM; Hernandez, LL				Sheftel, Celeste M.; Hernandez, Laura L.			Serotonin stimulated parathyroid hormone related protein induction in the mammary epithelia by transglutaminase-dependent serotonylation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; BONE LOSS; TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; REGULATES PTHRP; IN-VIVO; LACTATION; RECEPTOR; ACTIVATION; BREAST	Mammary-derived serotonin has been implicated in breast-to-bone communication during lactation by increasing parathyroid hormone related-protein (PTHrP) in the mammary gland. It is well established that PTHrP acts on the bone to liberate calcium for milk synthesis during lactation; however, the mechanism of serotonin's regulation of PTHrP has not been fully elucidated. Recently, serotonylation has been shown to be involved in a variety of physiological processes mediated by serotonin. Therefore, we investigated whether serotonylation is involved in serotonin's regulation of PTHrP in the mammary gland using lactogenically differentiated mouse mammary epithelial cells. We investigated the effect of increased intracellular serotonin using the antidepressant fluoxetine or 5-hydroxytryptophan (serotonin precursor), with or without transglutaminase inhibition and the corresponding action on PTHrP induction and activity. Treatment with fluoxetine or 5-hydroxytryptophan significantly increased intracellular serotonin concentrations and subsequently increased PTHrP gene expression, which was reduced with transglutaminase inhibition. Furthermore, we determined that transglutaminase activity is increased with lactogenic differentiation and 5-hydroxytryptophan or fluoxetine treatment. We investigated whether RhoA, Rac1, and Rab4 were potential serotonylation target proteins. We speculate that RhoA is potentially a serotonylation target protein. Our data suggest that serotonin regulates PTHrP induction in part through the process of serotonylation under lactogenic conditions in mouse mammary epithelial cells.

Risky sexual behavior and associated factors among sexually-active unmarried young female internal migrants working in Burayu Town, Ethiopia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALCOHOL-USE; MIGRATION; ACQUISITION; EXPERIENCE; INITIATION; STUDENTS; CONDOMS	Background Young female internal migrants are highly vulnerable to risky sexual behaviors (RSB) which may result in serious health problems such as unintended pregnancy, abortion and sexually transmitted infections including HIV. RSB includes early sexual debut (before 18 years), having multiple sexual partners, sex without a condom or inconsistent use of condom and sex under the influence of substance use. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and the factors associated with RSB among sexually-active unmarried young female internal migrants in Burayu Town, Ethiopia. Methods A cross sectional study design was used for the study. A total of 267 respondents was recruited into the study using a simple random sampling technique. A semi-structured interviews-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information from the study participants. The collected data were cleaned, coded and entered into Epi data version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS Ver.21 for analysis. Multiple logistic regression models were used to indicate the association between dependent and independent variables. The results About 35% of the young female internal migrants had sexual debut before the age of 18 years; 64.4% had sex without condom or inconsistently used condom; nearly one quarter of the participants had multiple sexual partners, and 29.6% had sex under the influence of substance uses. The magnitude of RSB among the study participants was (79.1%). Sexting [AOR 3.47(95%; CI;1.10-11.94)], frequent engagement in social media [AOR 10.9(95%;CI;2.31-51.89)], feeling of embarrassment to buy condom [AOR 8.28(95%; CI; 2.10-32.62)], unfavorable attitude toward using condom for steady and loving relationship [AOR 5.72(95%; CI; 1.47-22.24)] were related with RSB while self-efficacy [AOR 0.15(95%: CI; 0.04-0.57)] to use condom and perceived risks of getting pregnant [AOR 0.05(95%; CI; 0.01-0.23)] were found to be protective factors. Conclusion The study found high levels of RSB among sexually-active unmarried young female internal migrants. This finding suggests an urgent need of intervention to promote safe sex among this group. Special attention and prompt interventions are needed to promote the use of condoms.

J	Jordan, TR; Yekani, HAK; Sheen, M				Jordan, Timothy R.; Yekani, Hajar Aman Key; Sheen, Mercedes			Further investigation of the effects of wearing the hijab: Perception of female facial attractiveness by Emirati Muslim men living in their native Muslim country	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS; SEX; PERSONALITY; RELIABILITY; JUDGMENTS; BEAUTIFUL; CROSS; AGE	The hijab is central to the lives of Muslim women across the world but little is known about the actual effects exerted by this garment on perceptions of the wearer. Indeed, while previous research has suggested that wearing the hijab may affect the physical attractiveness of women, the actual effect of wearing the hijab on perceptions of female facial attractiveness by Muslim men in a Muslim country is largely unknown. Accordingly, this study investigated the effects of the hijab on female facial attractiveness perceived by practising Muslim men living in their native Muslim country (the United Arab Emirates). Participants were presented with frontal-head images of women shown in three conditions: in thefully coveredcondition, heads were completely covered by the hijab except for the face; in thepartially coveredcondition, heads were completely covered by the hijab except for the face and areas around the forehead and each side of the face and head; in theuncoveredcondition, heads had no covering at all. The findings revealed that faces where heads were uncovered or partially covered were rated as equally attractive, and both were rated as substantially more attractive than faces where heads were fully covered. Thus, while wearing the hijab can suppress female facial attractiveness to men, these findings suggest that not all hijab wearing has this effect, and female facial attractiveness for practising Muslim men living in their native Muslim country may not be reduced simply by wearing this garment. Indeed, from the findings we report, slight changes to the positioning of the hijab (thepartially coveredcondition) produce perceptions of facial attractiveness that are no lower than when no hijab is worn, and this may have important implications for wearing the hijab in Muslim societies. Finally, we argue that the pattern of effects we observed is not explained by anti-Islamic feeling or cultural endogamy, and that a major contributory factor is that being fully covered by the hijab occludes external features, especially the hair and lateral parts of the head and face, which, when normally visible, provide a substantial perceptual contribution to human facial attractiveness.

We investigated the clarity of policies of 171 major academic journals across disciplines regarding peer review and preprinting. 31.6% of journals surveyed do not provide information on the type of peer review they use. Information on whether preprints can be posted or not is unclear in 39.2% of journals. 58.5% of journals offer no clear information on whether reviewer identities are revealed to authors. Around 75% of journals have no clear policy on co-reviewing, citation of preprints, and publication of reviewer identities. Information regarding practices of open peer review is even more scarce, with <20% of journals providing clear information. Having found a lack of clear information, we conclude by examining the implications this has for researchers (especially early career) and the spread of open research practices.

To improve the accuracy of passenger satisfaction evaluation for public transport and the scientificity and objectivity of the index weighting, combining the characteristics of analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy weight method (EWM) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation(FCE) method, the passenger satisfaction evaluation system for Ningbo's urban public transportation was built. The paper analyzed 5046 questionnaires on conventional bus transit and 1682 questionnaires on rail transit in Ningbo city, Passenger satisfaction for Ningbo city's public transport was evaluated comprehensively, and the evaluation results showed that the overall passenger satisfaction of the public transport in Ningbo was 91.2 in 2019, The case study shows that the application of the AHP-EWM-FCE model on the multi-mode public transport system can objectively quantify passengers' feelings about urban public transport service, and thus provide a theoretical basis for the improvement of passenger satisfaction in Ningbo.

To face this increase in demand, health care systems need to adapt their response by increasing hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and by (re-)deploying doctors and other personnel. This paper proposes a forecast approach based on the Vector Error Correction model for the daily counts of hospitalized patients with symptoms and of patients in ICU, using publicly available data on the current COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, Switzerland and Spain. The level of analysis is the local government managing the health care system response, which corresponds to regions for Italy. The one-week-ahead forecasts are validated with out-of-sample data over successive weeks; they are found to provide timely and robust prediction of ICU capacity needs in Lombardy, the most-affected Italian region, starting from the sample of the first 2 weeks of data. The same methodology is successfully validated on other Italian regions, Switzerland and Spain. This approach may be used in other countries/regions/provinces to help adapt the health care system response to COVID-19 (or other similar disease); for this purpose, the open-source software code to produce the forecasts is provided with the paper.

Vaccination of yearling horses against poly-N-acetyl glucosamine fails to protect against infection with Streptococcus equi subspecies equi	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; CONJUGATE VACCINES; STRANGLES; ANTIBODY	Strangles is a common disease of horses with worldwide distribution caused by the bacterium Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (SEE). Although vaccines against strangles are available commercially, these products have limitations in safety and efficacy. The microbial surface antigen beta 1 -> 6 poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) is expressed by SEE. Here we show that intramuscular (IM) injection alone or a combination of IM plus intranasal (IN) immunization generated antibodies to PNAG that functioned to deposit complement and mediate opsonophagocytic killing of SEE ex vivo. However, immunization strategies targeting PNAG either by either IM only injection or a combination of IM and IN immunizations failed to protect yearling horses against infection following contact with infected horses in an experimental setting. We speculate that a protective vaccine against strangles will require additional components, such as those targeting SEE enzymes that degrade or inactivate equine IgG.

Numerous setting-based and individual-based interventions for student mental health have been proposed in the literature. However, the student perspective on those interventions has been largely neglected. This study aims to explore how medical students perceive different interventions and if they desire any additional changes with regard to their studies. Eight focus groups with 71 participants were conducted at a large German medical school. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed and content-analyzed using MAXQDA 18. We found that medical students prefer setting-based interventions. Most proposed interventions were on a setting-based level. For instance, students asked for more information on the university's psychosocial counseling services and for better information management regarding contact persons. Interventions proposed in the literature received mixed reactions: Several participants did not favour a pass/fail grading system. Students considered a peer-to-peer mentoring program for freshmen very helpful. Students had diverse attitudes towards Balint groups. They approved of several self-management courses, most of them being related to time or stress management. Interestingly, the most urgently wanted interventions appear to be rather easy to implement (e.g. a mentoring program). This study explored the medical student perspective on student mental health interventions. Additionally, our study illustrates the benefit and feasibility of involving students early on in the conception of interventions. Further research with a representative sample is needed to obtain broader information on the acceptance of the suggested interventions.

In electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS), CI users combine EH and AH in the same ear. In quiet, integration of EH and AH has been shown to be better with EAS, but with greater sensitivity to tonotopic mismatch in EH. The goal of the present study was to evaluate how external noise might affect integration of AH and EH within or across ears. Recognition of monosyllabic words was measured for normal-hearing subjects listening to simulations of unimodal (AH or EH alone), EAS, and bimodal listening in quiet and in speech-shaped steady noise (10 dB, 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio). The input/output frequency range for AH was 0.1-0.6 kHz. EH was simulated using an 8-channel noise vocoder. The output frequency range was 1.2-8.0 kHz to simulate a shallow insertion depth. The input frequency range was either matched (1.2-8.0 kHz) or mismatched (0.6-8.0 kHz) to the output frequency range; the mismatched input range maximized the amount of speech information, while the matched input resulted in some speech information loss. In quiet, tonotopic mismatch differently affected EAS and bimodal performance. In noise, EAS and bimodal performance was similarly affected by tonotopic mismatch. The data suggest that tonotopic mismatch may differently affect integration of EH and AH in quiet and in noise.

Selective pressures have favoured the evolution of kin recognition and avoidance of sib mating in numerous species, including the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. We studied the female neurogenomic response associated with sib mating avoidance after females were exposed to courtship displays by i) unrelated males or ii) related males or iii) no courtship (controls). First, by comparing the transcriptional responses of females exposed to courtship displays to those exposed to controls, we saw a rapid and extensive transcriptional shift consistent with social environment. Second, by comparing the transcriptional responses of females exposed to courtship by related to those exposed to unrelated males, we characterized distinct and repeatable transcriptomic patterns that correlated with the relatedness of the courting male. Network analysis revealed 3 modules of specific 'sib-responsive' genes that were distinct from other 'courtship-responsive' modules. Therefore, specific neurogenomic states with characteristic brain transcriptomes associated with different behavioural responses affect sib mating avoidance behaviour.

In this work, we aimed to find markers of acute toxicity of p,p'-DDT exposure among proteins expressed in NES2Y human pancreatic beta-cells employing 2-D electrophoresis. We exposed NES2Y cells to a high concentration (150 mu M, LC96 after 72 hours) of p,p'-DDT for 24 and 30 hours and determined proteins with changed expression using 2-D electrophoresis. We have found 22 proteins that changed their expression. They included proteins involved in ER stress (GRP78, and endoplasmin), mitochondrial proteins (GRP75, ECHM, IDH3A, NDUS1, and NDUS3), proteins involved in the maintenance of the cell morphology (EFHD2, TCPA, NDRG1, and ezrin), and some other proteins (HNRPF, HNRH1, K2C8, vimentin, PBDC1, EF2, PCNA, biliverdin reductase, G3BP1, FRIL, and HSP27). The proteins we have identified may serve as indicators of p,p'-DDT toxicity in beta-cells in future studies, including long-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations.

Methods Identical flow- and gas-signals were transmitted to both K5s that always operated simultaneously either in BBB- or DMC-mode. To assess RELINTRA and RELINTER, a metabolic simulator was applied to simulate four graded levels of respiration. RELINTRA and RELINTER were expressed as typical error (TE%) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). To assess also inter-unit differences via natural respiratory signals, 12 male athletes performed one incremental bike step test each in BBB- and DMC-mode. Inter-unit differences within biological testing were expressed as percentages. Results In BBB, TE% of RELINTRA ranged 0.30-0.67 vs. RELINTER 0.16-1.39 and ICC ranged 0.57-1.00 vs. 0.09-1.00. In DMC, TE% of RELINTRA ranged 0.38-0.90 vs. RELINTER 0.03-0.86 and ICC ranged 0.22-1.00 vs. 0.52-1.00. Mean inter-unit differences ranged -2.30-2.20% (Cohen's ds (ds) 0.13-1.52) for BBB- and -0.55-0.61% (ds 0.00-0.65) for DMC-mode, respectively. Inter-unit differences for VO2 and RER were significant (p < 0.05) at each step. Conclusion Two structurally identical K5-units demonstrated accurate RELINTRA with TE < 2.0% and similar RELINTER during metabolic simulation. During biological testing, inter-unit differences for VO2 and RER in BBB-mode were higher than 2% with partially large ES in BBB. Hence, the K5 should be allocated personally wherever possible. Otherwise, e.g. in multicenter studies, a decrease in total reliability needs to be considered especially when the BBB-mode is applied.

B. M.; Hartmann, Katrin			Cats shedding pathogenic Leptospira spp.-An underestimated zoonotic risk?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CLINICAL LEPTOSPIROSIS; INTERROGANS; PREVALENCE; ANTIBODIES; SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY; COMMUNITIES; FEATURES; WATER; DOGS	Shedding of DNA of pathogenic Leptospira spp. has been documented in naturally infected cats in several countries, but urinary shedding of infectious Leptospira spp. has only recently been proven. The climate in Southern Chile is temperate rainy with high annual precipitations which represents ideal preconditions for survival of Leptospira spp., especially during spring and summer. The aims of this study were to investigate shedding of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in outdoor cats in Southern Chile, to perform molecular characterization of isolates growing in culture, and to assess potential risk factors associated with shedding. Urine samples of 231 outdoor cats from rural and urban areas in southern Chile were collected. Urine samples were investigated for pathogenic Leptospira spp. by 4 techniques: qPCR targeting the lipL32 gene, immunomagnetic separation (IMS)-coupled qPCR (IMS-qPCR), direct culture and IMS-coupled culture. Positive urine cultures were additionally confirmed by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to molecularly characterize isolates obtained from positive cultures. Overall, 36 urine samples (15.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.4-20.9) showed positive results. Eighteen (7.8%, 95% CI 4.9-12.1), 30 (13%, 95% CI 9.2-18), 3 (1.3%, 0.3-3.9) and 4 cats (1.7%; 95% CI 0.5-4.5) were positive in qPCR, IMS-qPCR, conventional culture, and IMS-coupled culture, respectively. MLST results of 7 culture-positive cats revealed sequences that could be assigned to sequence type 17 (6 cats) and sequence type 27 (1 cat) corresponding to L. interrogans (Pathogenic Leptospira Subgroup 1). Shedding of pathogenic Leptospira spp. by cats might be an underestimated source of infection for other species including humans. The present study is the first one reporting growth of leptospires from feline urine in culture in naturally infected cats in South-America and characterisation of culture-derived isolates. So far, very few cases of successful attempts to culture leptospires from naturally infected cats are described worldwide.

J	Rauchfleisch, A; Kaiser, J				Rauchfleisch, Adrian; Kaiser, Jonas			The False positive problem of automatic bot detection in social science research	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AREAS	The identification of bots is an important and complicated task. The bot classifier"Botometer"was successfully introduced as a way to estimate the number of bots in a given list of accounts and, as a consequence, has been frequently used in academic publications. Given its relevance for academic research and our understanding of the presence of automated accounts in any given Twitter discourse, we are interested inBotometer's diagnostic ability over time. To do so, we collected theBotometerscores for five datasets (three verified as bots, two verified as human; n = 4,134) in two languages (English/German) over three months. We show that theBotometerscores are imprecise when it comes to estimating bots; especially in a different language. We further show in an analysis ofBotometerscores over time thatBotometer's thresholds, even when used very conservatively, are prone to variance, which, in turn, will lead to false negatives (i.e., bots being classified as humans) and false positives (i.e., humans being classified as bots). This has immediate consequences for academic research as most studies in social science using the tool will unknowingly count a high number of human users as bots and vice versa. We conclude our study with a discussion about how computational social scientists should evaluate machine learning systems that are developed for identifying bots.

Specialized cattle farming in the Neolithic Rhine-Meuse Delta: Results from zooarchaeological and stable isotope (delta O-18, delta C-13, delta N-15) analyses	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEAWEED-EATING SHEEP; BONE-COLLAGEN; MORTALITY PROFILES; BIRTH SEASONALITY; MILLENNIUM BC; CARBON; NITROGEN; DIET; HUSBANDRY; RATIOS	Schipluiden (3630-3380 cal BC), the earliest known year-round settlement in the Rhine-Meuse Delta in the Netherlands, is a key site for addressing the nature of Neolithic subsistence in the wetlands of northwestern Europe. A preliminary zooarchaeological study suggested that cattle husbandry was a major activity at Schipluiden. In contrast, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of human remains from the site indicated a marine-oriented diet, implying that the Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary transition continued well into the mid-4(th)Millennium BC in this region. Here, we re-investigate the role and nature of cattle husbandry at Neolithic Schipluiden using mortality profiles and stable isotope analysis (delta O-18, delta C-13, delta N-15) of animal bone collagen and tooth enamel. The age-at-death analysis suggests that cattle were managed for both meat and milk production. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 analysis of tooth enamel provide evidence that calving spread over five-and-a-half-months, which would have led to a longer availability of milk throughout the year. Cattle were grazing in open, marshy environments near the site and winter foddering was practiced occasionally. The faunal isotopic data also reveal that the high(15)N in human bone collagen is more likely to signal the consumption of products from cattle that grazed on(15)N-enriched salt marsh plants around the site, rather than a marine-oriented diet. This undermines the previous interpretation of the dietary practices at Schipluiden by showing that human diet in mid-4(th)millennium BC Rhine-Meuse area was fully "Neolithic", based primarily on products from domesticates, especially cattle, with some input from wild terrestrial and aquatic resources available in their surroundings, contrary to what has been proposed before. Collating these results demonstrates a high level of investment in cattle husbandry, highlighting the social and economic importance of cattle at the lower Rhine-Meuse Delta during the 4(th)millennium BC.

In women who have had GDM, an elevated body mass index (BMI) may have a substantial impact for persistent hyperglycemia in their lives after gestation. Beyond hyperglycemia, increased local oxidative stress directly promotes the formation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs). Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to determine the relationship between the level of AGEs and/or related metabolic biomarkers with GDM. Methods Literature search was carried out through visiting electronic databases, indexing services, and directories including PubMed/MEDLINE (Ovid(R)), EMBASE (Ovid(R)), google scholar and WorldCat to retrieve studies without time limit. Following screening and eligibility evaluation, relevant data were extracted from included studies and analyzed using Rev-Man 5.3 and STATA 15.0. Inverse variance method with random effects pooling model was used for the analysis of outcome measures at 95% confidence interval. Hedge's adjusted g statistics was applied to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) to consider the small sample bias. Besides, meta-regression, meta-influence, and publication bias analyses were conducted. The protocol has been registered on PROSPERO with ID: CRD42020173867. Results A total of 16 original studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis. Compared with women with pregnant controls, the level of AGE was significantly higher in women with GDM (SMD [95% CI] = 2.26 [1.50-3.02], Z = 5.83, P < 0.00001; I-2= 97%, P< 0.0001). The BMI was also significantly higher in women with GDM (SMD [95% CI] = 0.97 [0.33-1.62], Z = 2.98, P = 0.003) compared to controls. Regarding specific and related metabolic biomarkers, there was higher level of HOMA-IR (SMD [95% CI] = 0.39 [0.22-0.55], Z = 4.65, P < 0.0001, after sensitivity analysis) and HbA1c (SMD [95% CI] = 0.58 [0.03-1.12], Z = 2.07, P = 0.04, after sensitivity analysis) in gestational diabetic women. Subgroup analyses indicated that studies conducted in Asia and Europe, at third trimester of pregnancy and blood/plasma AGE samples showed a significant difference in AGE level among women with GDM compared to pregnant controls. What is more, meta-regression with the sample size (regression coefficient (Q) = -0.0092, P = 0.207) and year of publication (Q = 0.0035, P = 0.984) suggested that the covariates had no significant effect on the heterogeneity. Conclusion The study indicated that there was a strong relationship between AGE and GDM. Besides, the BMI and other specific biomarkers showed a significant difference between the two groups indicating the high risk of developing long-standing type 2 diabetes and its complications in gestational diabetic women.

Like its biological prototypes, this basic component is robust to parameter variation but can be modulated by external inputs. By combining these modules, we can construct a neural state machine capable of generating the cyclic or repetitive behaviors necessary for legged locomotion. A concrete case study for the approach is provided by a modular robot constructed from flexible plastic volumetric pixels, in which we produce a forward crawling gait entrained to the natural frequency of the robot by a minimal system of twelve neurons organized into four modules.

The aim of the present investigation was to assess performance and clinical utility of a comprehensive DNA panel for myeloid neoplasms. Sixty-one previously well characterized samples were sequenced using TSO500 library preparation kit on NextSeq550 platform. Variants with a VAF >= 5% and a total read depth of >50X were filtered for analysis. The following results were recorded-for clinical samples: clinical sensitivity (97%), specificity (100%), precision (100%) and accuracy (99%) whereas reference control results were 100% for analytical sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy, with high intra- and inter-run reproducibility. The panel identified 880 variants across 292 genes, of which, 749 variants were in genes not covered in the 54 gene panel. The investigation revealed 14 variants in ten genes, and at least one was present in 96.2% patient samples that were pathogenic/ likely pathogenic in myeloid neoplasms. Also, 15 variants in five genes were found to be pathogenic/ likely pathogenic in other tumor types. Further, the TMB and MSI scores ranged from 0-7 and 0-9, respectively. The high analytical performance and clinical utility of this comprehensive NGS panel makes it practical and clinically relevant for adoption in clinical laboratories for routine molecular profiling of myeloid neoplasms.

Functional characterization of extrinsic tongue muscles in the Pink1-/- rat model of Parkinson disease	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN PATHOLOGY; DEFICITS; DEGENERATION; INVOLVEMENT; EXPRESSION; DYSPHAGIA; FEATURES; NERVES; FORCE	Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with speech and swallowing difficulties likely due to pathology in widespread brain and nervous system regions. In post-mortem studies of PD, pathology has been reported in pharyngeal and laryngeal nerves and muscles. However, it is unknown whether PD is associated with neuromuscular changes in the tongue. Prior work in a rat model of PD ( Pink1-/- ) showed oromotor and swallowing deficits in the premanifest stage which suggested sensorimotor impairments of these functions. The present study tested the hypothesis that Pink1-/- rats show altered tongue function coinciding with neuromuscular differences within tongue muscles compared to wildtype (WT). Male Pink1-/- and WT rats underwent behavioral tongue function assays at 4 and 6 months of age (n = 7-8 rats per group), which are time points early in the disease. At 6 months, genioglossus (GG) and styloglossus (SG) muscles were analyzed for myosin heavy chain isoforms (MyHC), alpha-synuclein levels, myofiber size, centrally nucleated myofibers, and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation. Pink1-/- showed greater tongue press force variability, and greater tongue press forces and rates as compared to WT. Additionally, Pink1-/- showed relative increases of MyHC 2a in SG, but typical MyHC profiles in GG. Western blots revealed Pink1-/- had more alpha-synuclein protein than WT in GG, but not in SG. There were no differences between Pink1-/- and WT in myofiber size, centrally-nucleated myofibers, or NMJ innervation. alpha-synuclein protein was observed in nerves, NMJ, and vessels in both genotypes. Findings at these early disease stages suggest small changes or no changes in several peripheral biological measures, and intact motor innervation of tongue muscles. Future work should evaluate these measures at later disease stages to determine when robust pathological peripheral change contributes to functional change, and what CNS deficits cause behavioral changes. Understanding how PD affects central and peripheral mechanisms will help determine therapy targets for speech and swallowing disorders.

Alcohol use, depressive symptoms, and intimate partner violence perpetration: A longitudinal analysis among men with HIV in northern Vietnam	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TIMELINE FOLLOWBACK; RISK-FACTORS; NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE; SOCIAL DESIRABILITY; CONSUMPTION; DRINKING; PREVALENCE; HEALTH; ASSOCIATIONS; CHALLENGES	Background While the link between alcohol use and male-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV) has been well-established, research is needed to test whether psychosocial factors interact with alcohol use to exacerbate IPV perpetration. We tested whether depressive symptoms influenced the strength and/or direction of the alcohol-IPV relationship among men with HIV in Vietnam. Methods This study is a secondary analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. Participants were clinic patients with HIV and hazardous alcohol use. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, three, six, and 12 months. Alcohol use was assessed as proportion of days alcohol abstinent. Analyses were restricted to males who reported being married/cohabitating at baseline (N = 313). Multilevel growth models were used to test whether time-varying depressive symptoms modified the time-varying effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration. Results Time-varying depressive symptoms modified the effect of proportion of days alcohol abstinent on IPV perpetration. However, the pattern of effect modification was not as expected, as reporting depressive symptoms weakened the alcohol-IPV relationship. At times when participants screened negative for depressive symptoms, those who reported higher proportion of days alcohol abstinent than usual had significantly lower odds of IPV perpetration (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.17, 95% Confidence Interval 0.06, 0.45, p = 0.0004). At times when participants screened positive for depressive symptoms, there was no observed effect of alcohol use on IPV perpetration (OR = 4.28, 95% CI 0.80, 22.78, p = 0.09). Conclusion The findings highlight the complex nature of the alcohol-IPV relationship and the need to investigate the intersection between hazardous drinking, mental health, and IPV. Men who concurrently report depressive symptoms and heightened alcohol use may be socially isolated from an intimate partner or experiencing fatigue, leading to less alcohol-related IPV perpetration. Mental health interventions addressing depression and alcohol misuse integrated into HIV services may reduce IPV perpetration.	[Hershow, Rebecca B.; Reyes, H.

Does the COVID-19 pandemic impact parents' and adolescents' well-being? An EMA-study on daily affect and parenting	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENERALIZED ANXIETY; NEGATIVE AFFECT; UNCERTAINTY; INTOLERANCE; DEPRESSION; STRESS; VALIDITY; VARIABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCE	Due to the COVID- 19 outbreak in the Netherlands (March 2020) and the associated social distancing measures, families were enforced to stay at home as much as possible. Adolescents and their families may be particularly affected by this enforced proximity, as adolescents strive to become more independent. Yet, whether these measures impact emotional well-being in families with adolescents has not been examined. In this ecological momentary assessment study, we investigated if the COVID-19 pandemic affected positive and negative affect of parents and adolescents and parenting behaviors (warmth and criticism). Additionally, we examined possible explanations for the hypothesized changes in affect and parenting. To do so, we compared daily reports on affect and parenting that were gathered during two periods of 14 consecutive days, once before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018-2019) and once during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses showed that only parents' negative affect increased as compared to the period before the pandemic, whereas this was not the case for adolescents' negative affect, positive affect and parenting behaviors (from both the adolescent and parent perspective). In general, intolerance of uncertainty was linked to adolescents' and parents' negative affect and adolescents' positive affect. However, Intolerance of uncertainty, nor any pandemic related characteristics (i.e. living surface, income, relatives with COVID-19, hours of working at home, helping children with school and contact with COVID-19 patients at work) were linked to the increase of parents' negative affect during COVID-19. It can be concluded that on average, our sample (consisting of relatively healthy parents and adolescents) seems to deal fairly well with the circumstances. The substantial heterogeneity in the data however, also suggest that whether or not parents and adolescents experience (emotional) problems can vary from household to household. Implications for researchers, mental health care professionals and policy makers are discussed.	[Janssen, Loes H. C.; Kullberg, Marie-Louise J.; Verkuil, Bart; van Zwieten, Noa; Wever, Mirjam C.

Perceptions of Pacific children's academic performance at age 6 years: A multi-informant agreement study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ISLANDS FAMILIES; SELF-ASSESSMENT; TEACHER CONCORDANCE; EDUCATION POLICY; PARENT; LANGUAGE; LITERACY; DISORDER; STUDENTS; PERSPECTIVES	Purpose In New Zealand, Pacific immigrants are among the fastest growing ethnic minorities but, as a group, they are also at most risk of not realising their literacy and educational aspirations critical for achieving their human potential and wellbeing. This may be due, in part, to a misalignment in the shared understanding of academic success between students, parents and their teachers within largely non-Pacific school environments. This study aims to report levels of agreement in child-mother, child-teacher, and mother-teacher perceptions of Pacific children's academic performance at age 6 years. Method A cohort of Pacific infants born during 2000 in Auckland, New Zealand, was followed as part of the Pacific Islands Families study. Maternal home interviews were conducted at 6-weeks and 6-years postpartum, together with separate child and teacher elicitations at 6-years. Pairwise agreement of academic performance responses was assessed using Cohen's weighted kappa statistic, along with symmetry and marginal homogeneity tests. Results At 6-years, information was available for 1,001 children and their mothers, and teachers' evaluations for 549 children. Negligible to slight agreements and significant asymmetry were found between the child-mother (kappa = 0.03, 95% CI: -0.03, 0.09), child-teacher (kappa = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.08), and mother-teacher (kappa = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.11) pairwise assessments-with children and mothers more likely to rate Pacific children's academic performance higher than their teachers. Significantly higher concordances with teacher assessments were found among mothers with post-secondary education, proficiency in English, and stronger alignment with New Zealand culture and for children who performed strongly on a standardised measure of performance relative to their peers. Conclusion Strategies are needed to align Pacific students' and parental perceptions with documented educational achievement outcomes and to facilitate more effective and timely feedback on achievement results and home-school communication. The importance of removing language, cultural and socio-economic barriers to achieving shared understanding of academic performance between teachers and families is highlighted.

A qualitative exploratory study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXPERIENCES; TRAUMA; VIEWS; HARM; HOSPITALIZATION; PARTICIPATION; FEASIBILITY; RECOVERY; SUICIDE; PEOPLE	Introduction There is a dearth of research to guide acute adolescent mental health inpatient care. Self-determination Theory provides evidence that meeting needs for relatedness, autonomy and competence is likely to increase wellbeing and intrinsic motivation. These needs may be able to be met in the inpatient environment. Method This qualitative study aimed to explore young peoples experience of acute mental health inpatient care with particular attention to meeting of these three needs. Fifteen young people were interviewed. The importance of relatedness with staff, other young people and families was identified. Results Relatedness with staff and peers were valued parts of admission. Some young people describe enhanced relatedness with family. They described loss of autonomy as a negative experience but appreciated opportunities to be involved in choices around their care and having more freedom. Coming into hospital was associated with loss of competence but they described building competence during the admission. Engaging in activities was experienced positively and appeared to enhance meeting of all three needs. Meeting of the three needs was associated with an experience of increased safety. Conclusions Engaging young people in activities with a focus on relatedness, autonomy and competence may have specific therapeutic potential. Autonomy, experience of competence and connection with staff may enhance safety more effectively than physical containment. Peer contact may have untapped therapeutic value we understand little of. This study supports the value of Self-determination Theory as a guide day to day inpatient care to meet the needs of adolescents for relatedness, autonomy and competence.

Aim of this study was to explore how different professions working at Intensive Care Units (ICU) estimate the mobility capacity using the ICU Mobility Score in 10 different scenarios. Methods Ten fictitious patient-scenarios and guideline-related knowledge were assessed using an online survey. Critical care team members in German-speaking countries were invited to participate. All datasets including professional data and at least one scenario were analyzed. Kruskal Wallis test was used for the individual scenarios, while a linear mixed-model was used over all responses. Results In total, 515 of 788 (65%) participants could be evaluated. Physicians (p = 0.001) and nurses (p = 0.002) selected a lower ICU Mobility Score (-0.7 95% CI -1.1 to -0.3 and -0.4 95% CI -0.7 to -0.2, respectively) than physical therapists, while other specialists did not (p = 0.81). Participants who classified themselves as experts or could define early mobilization in accordance to the "S2e guideline: positioning and early mobilisation in prophylaxis or therapy of pulmonary disorders" correctly selected higher mobilization levels (0.2 95% CI 0.0 to 0.4, p = 0.049 and 0.3 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, p = 0.002, respectively). Conclusion Different professions scored the mobilization capacity of patients differently, with nurses and physicians estimating significantly lower capacity than physical therapists. The exact knowledge of guidelines and recommendations, such as the definition of early mobilization, independently lead to a higher score. Interprofessional education, interprofessional rounds and mobilization activities could further enhance knowledge and practice of mobilization in the critical care team.

Burden of stigma among tuberculosis patients in a pastoralist community in Kenya: A mixed methods study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOUTHERN THAILAND; HIV; DIAGNOSIS; BARRIERS; PERCEPTION; ADHERENCE; AWARENESS; HIV/AIDS; THERAPY; PEOPLE	Background Tuberculosis (TB) stigma remains a barrier to early diagnosis and treatment completion. Increased understanding of stigma is necessary for improved interventions to minimise TB stigma and its effects. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively measure TB stigma and to explore qualitatively its manifestation among TB patients in a rural Kenyan community. Methods This hospital based study using explanatory sequential mixed methods approach was conducted in 2016. In the quantitative part of the study, a questionnaire containing socio-demographic characteristics and scales measuring perceived TB stigma and experienced TB stigma, was administered to 208 adult pulmonary TB patients receiving treatment in West Pokot County. Respondents with high stigma were purposively selected to take part in in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The qualitative data were collected through 15 in-depth interviews and 6 focus group discussions with TB patients. Descriptive and bivariate analysis was done for the quantitative data while the thematic analysis was done for qualitative data. Results The internal consistency reliability coefficients were satisfactory with Cronbach alphas of 0.87 and 0.86 for the 11-item and 12-item stigma measurement scale. The investigation revealed that TB stigma was high. The key drivers of TB stigma were the association of TB with HIV/AIDS and the fear of TB transmission. TB stigma was exemplified through patients being isolated by others, self-isolation, fear to disclose TB diagnosis, association of TB with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and lack of social support. Being a woman was significantly associated with high levels of both experienced stigma (p = 0.007) and perceived stigma (p = 0.005) while age, marital status, occupation and the patient's religion were not. Conclusion There is a need to implement stigma reduction interventions in order to improve TB program outcomes.

Malta's population density, large proportion of elderly and high prevalence of diabetes and obesity put the country at risk of uncontrolled viral transmission and high mortality. Despite this, Malta achieved low mortality rates compared to figures overseas. The aim of this paper is to identify key factors that contributed to these favorable outcomes. Methods This is a retrospective, observational, nationwide study which evaluates outcomes of patients during the first wave of the pandemic in Malta, from the 7(th)of March to the 24(th)of April 2020. Data was collected on demographics and mode of transmission. Hospitalization rates to Malta's main general hospital, Mater Dei Hospital, length of in-hospital stay, intensive care unit admissions and 30-day mortality were also analyzed. Results There were 447 confirmed cases in total; 19.5% imported, 74.2% related to community transmission and 6.3% nosocomially transmitted. Ninety-three patients (20.8%) were hospitalized, of which 4 were children. Patients with moderate-severe disease received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, in line with evidence available at the time. A total of 4 deaths were recorded, resulting in an all-cause mortality of 0.89%. Importantly, all admitted patients with moderate-severe disease survived to 30-day follow up. Conclusion Effective public health interventions, widespread testing, remote surveillance of patients in the community and a low threshold for admission are likely to have contributed to these favorable outcomes. Hospital infection control measures were key in preventing significant nosocomial spread. These concepts can potentially be applied to stem future outbreaks of viral diseases. Patients with moderate-severe disease had excellent outcomes with no deaths reported at 30-day follow up.

Here, we demonstrate that alternative isoforms of the KDM2A and KDM2B lysine demethylases have the ability to negatively regulate canonical Wnt signaling. These KDM2A and KDM2B isoforms (KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF) lack the N-terminal demethylase domain, but they still have the ability to bind to CpG islands in promoters and to interact with their protein partners via their other functional domains. We have observed that KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF bind to the promoters of axin 2 and cyclin D1, two canonical Wnt signaling target genes, and repress their activity. Moreover, KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are both able to strongly repress a Wnt-responsive luciferase reporter. The transcriptional repression mediated by KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF, but also by KDM2A-LF, is dependent on their DNA binding domain, while the N-terminal demethylase domain is dispensable for this process. Surprisingly, KDM2B-LF is unable to repress both the endogenous promoters and the luciferase reporter. Finally, we show that both KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are able to interact with TCF7L1, one of the transcriptional mediators of canonical Wnt signaling. KDM2A-SF and KDM2B-SF are thus likely to negatively affect the transcription of canonical Wnt signaling target genes by binding to their promoters and by interacting with TCF7L1 and other co-repressors.

Methods Participants were randomly selected from a diabetes outpatient facility (N = 216) and from among patients admitted to a medical center and psychiatric hospital (N = 99). The participants completed the PHQ-9. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to identify the presence of psychiatric symptoms. The optimal cut-offs for PHQ-9 in people with and without type 2 diabetes were investigated based on two methods: 1) Youden's index which identifies cut-off points useful in scientific research; 2) a second method of two-stage screening for depressive disorders to provide guidance for clinical practice. Results The Polish version of the PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid screening tool for depression in people with and without type 2 diabetes. An optimal cut-off of >= 7 was indicated by Youden's index and >= 5 by the two-stage method for screening for MDD and 'MDD and/or dysthymia' in the group with type 2 diabetes. A cut-off of >= 11 was optimal for screening for both MDD and 'MDD and/or dysthymia' among people without diabetes (Youden's index). The two-stage approach suggested a >= 10 score for screening for MDD and >= 9 for screening for 'MDD and/or dysthymia' in people without diabetes. Conclusions A lower cut-off score of the PHQ-9 is recommended for people with type 2 diabetes as compared to the general population.

Social network analysis and the implications for Pontocaspian biodiversity conservation in Romania and Ukraine: A comparative study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MYTILOPSIS-LEUCOPHAEATA; STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS; GOVERNANCE; KNOWLEDGE; PARTICIPATION; DREISSENIDAE; MANAGEMENT; BIVALVIA; MOLLUSCA	Romania and Ukraine share the Black Sea coastline, the Danube Delta and associated habitats, which harbor the endemic, aquatic Pontocaspian biota. Currently, this biota is diminishing both in numbers of species and their abundance because of human activities, and its future persistence strongly depends on the adequacy of conservation measures. Romania and Ukraine have a common responsibility to address the conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity. The two countries, however have different socio-political and legal conservation frameworks, which may result in differences in the social network structure of stakeholder institutions with different implications for Pontocaspian biodiversity conservation. Here, we study the social network structure of stakeholder organizations involved in conservation of Pontocaspian biodiversity in Romania and the implications of network structure for conservation outcomes. Then we compare the findings from Romania to an earlier similar study from Ukraine. We apply a mix of qualitative and quantitative social network analysis methods to combine the content and context of the interactions with relational measures. We show that Pontocaspian biodiversity plays a minor and mostly incidental role in the inter-organizational interactions in Romania. Furthermore, there is room for improvement in the network structure through e.g. more involvement of governmental and nongovernmental organizations and increased motivation of central stakeholders to initiate conservation actions. Social variables, such as lack of funding, hierarchical, non-inclusive system of conservation governance and continuous institutional reforms in the public sector are consequential for the network relations and structure. Social network of stakeholders in Ukraine is more connected and central stakeholders utilize their favorable positions. However, neither in Ukraine is the Pontocaspian biodiversity a driver of organizational interactions. Consequently, both networks translate into sub-optimal conservation actions and the roads to optimal conservation are different. We end with sketching out conservation implications and recommendations for improved national and cross-border conservation efforts.

In this study, we aimed to identify novel PD-associated genes and clarify their clinical and biological significance in GC. Materials and methods We identified LOXL1 as a PD-associated candidate gene by in silico analysis of GC datasets (highly disseminated peritoneal GC cell line and two freely available GC datasets, GSE15459 and TCGA). Next, we evaluated the clinical significance of LOXL1 expression using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) in a validation cohort (Kyushu cohort). Moreover, we performed gene expression analysis, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with GSE15459 and TCGA datasets. Finally, we performed a series of in vitro experiments using GC cells. Results In silico analysis showed that LOXL1 was overexpressed in tumor tissues of GC patients with PD and in highly disseminated peritoneal GC cells, relative to that in the control GC patients and cells, respectively. High expression of LOXL1 was a poor prognostic factor in the TCGA dataset. Next, IHC showed that LOXL1 was highly expressed in GC cells. High LOXL1 mRNA expression was associated with poorly differentiated histological type, lymph node metastasis, and was an independent poor prognostic factor in the Kyushu validation cohort. Moreover, LOXL1 expression was positively correlated with the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) gene set in GSEA. Finally, LOXL1-overexpressing GC cells changed their morphology to a spindle-like form. LOXL1 overexpression reduced CDH1 expression; increased the expression of VIM, CDH2, SNAI2, and PLS3; and promoted the migration capacity of GC cells. Conclusions LOXL1 is associated with PD in GC, possibly through the induction of EMT.

However, research is limited among Asian populations, where food sources for diet-related GHGE differ from those in Western populations. This study aimed to investigate associations between diet-related GHGE and the prevalence of inadequate nutritional intake. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 392 healthy Japanese volunteers aged 20-69 years. Dietary intake was assessed by four-non-consecutive day diet record. Diet-related GHGE was estimated using the Global Link Input-Output model and adjusted for energy intake by residual method. Prevalence of inadequacy was defined as a percentage of participants with nutrient intake outside the Tentative Dietary Goal for Preventing Lifestyle-Related Disease or below the Estimated Average Requirement defined by the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for Japanese. The association between diet-related GHGE and the prevalence of inadequacy of the usual intake of each nutrient was examined using logistic regression models. Results Participants with higher diet-related GHGE had overall better adherence to the DRIs. Intakes of all selected nutrients were positively associated with diet-related GHGE, except for carbohydrate, total fat, and saturated fat. With increasing quartile of diet-related GHGE, the prevalence of inadequacy decreased for protein, dietary fiber, potassium, vitamins A, B-6, and C, thiamin, riboflavin, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, while that for sodium increased. Conclusions Diets with lower diet-related GHGE did not have better adherence to the DRIs compared to diets with higher diet-related GHGE among Japanese adults. Drastic dietary change or other strategies such as improving the food system would be needed to achieve a sustainable and healthy diet among Japanese.

However, these highly complicated and cost technologies have not yet been translated into full clinical utility. In addition, the clinicians are expected to gain more guidance of treatment for different molecular subtypes. In this study, we developed a panel of gastric cancer patients in population from Southern China using commercially accessible TMA and immunohistochemical technology. A cohort of 259 GC patients was classified into 4 subtypes on the basis of expression of mismatch repair proteins (PMS2, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6), E-cadherin and p21 protein. We observed that the subtypes presented distinct prognosis. dMMR-like subtype was associated with the best prognosis, and E-cadherin-a subtype was associated with the worst prognosis. Patients with p21-High and p21-Ligh subtypes had intermediate overall survival. In multivariate analysis, the dMMR-like subtype remained an independent prediction power for overall survival in the model. We described a molecular classification of gastric cancers using clinically applicable assay. The biological relevance of the four subtypes was illustrated by significant differences in prognosis. Our molecular classification provided an effective and inexpensive screening tool for improving prognostic models. Nevertheless, our study should be considered preliminary and carries a limited predictive value as a single-center retrospective study.

Little is known about the association of glucose metabolism and retinopathy signs in the non-diabetic middle-aged population. We studied prevalence of retinopathy in a subsample of Northern Finland Birth Cohort study (NFBC1966) of 1809 subjects, at 47 years of age, without previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes and/or blood pressure-lowering medication. All participants underwent clinical evaluations including an oral glucose tolerance test (glucose and insulin values measured at 0, 30, 60 and 120 min) and HbA(1c). The retinopathy signs were diagnosed by fundus photographs and classified according to the Eurodiab classification scheme. The overall prevalence of newly diagnosed retinopathy was 1.4%. The retinopathy signs were significantly associated with increased 30 min, 1-h and 2-h glucose levels and 2-h insulin level in an OGTT. After adjustment with systolic blood pressure, only 30 min glucose, 1-h glucose and 2-h insulin levels were associated with retinopathy signs. Our findings show the potential role of 30 min and 1-h post-load glucose and 2-h insulin levels as risk factors for retinopathy lesions among the participants without previously diagnosed diabetes or hypertensive medication.

LSFC patients carry mutations in the Leucine Rich Pentatricopeptide Repeat Containing (LRPPRC) gene, which lead to defects in the respiratory chain complexes and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial respiration modulates cellular metabolic activity, which impacts many cell types including the differentiation and function of immune cells. Hence, we postulated that, in addition to neurological and metabolic disorders, LSFC patients may show impaired immune activity. To gain insight into the quality of the immune response in LSFC patients, we examined the response to the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine by measuring antibody titers to MMR in the plasma. In a cohort of eight LSFC patients, the response to the MMR vaccine was variable, with some individuals showing antibodies to all three viruses, while others had antibodies to two or fewer viruses. These results suggest that the mutations in the LRPPRC gene present in LSFC patients may affect the immune response to vaccines.

Previous research suggests that sharing emotionally intense or painful experiences with others leads to "identity fusion," a visceral feeling of oneness with a group that predicts strong forms of prosocial action and self-sacrifice for other group members. This study compared identity fusion with other mothers during pregnancy versus after childbirth in a sample of 164 U.S. women. Eighty-nine mothers in our sample were pregnant with their firstborn, and 75 mothers had given birth to their firstborn up to 6 months prior to the time of data collection. Results demonstrated that identity fusion with other mothers was higher for postpartum mothers than for antenatal mothers. As predicted, among postpartum mothers, those who thought that their childbirth was more painful than a typical childbirth experience reported greater identity fusion with mothers who reported having had a very difficult birth. Postpartum mothers' ruminative thought about the birth mediated the association between level of dysphoria and identity fusion, and identity fusion moderated the association between postpartum mothers' ruminative and reflective thought about the birth and their posttraumatic growth in complex ways. These findings provide evidence that perceived sharedness of the childbirth experience and thoughts about the birth are important to the process of identity fusion with other mothers, and highlight the importance of post-event processing for psychological health.

In April 2020, the first-ever nationally representative survey in Canada polled 4,240 adults age 18 years and older about self-reported COVID experience in March, early in the epidemic. We examined the levels and predictors of COVID symptoms, defined as fever plus difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, dry cough so severe that it disrupts sleep, and/or loss of sense of smell; and testing for SARS-CoV-2 by respondents and/or household members. About 8% of Canadians reported that they and/or one or more household members experienced COVID symptoms. Symptoms were more common in younger than in older adults, and among visible minorities. Overall, only 3% of respondents and/or household members reported testing for SARS-CoV-2. Being tested was associated with having COVID symptoms, Indigenous identity, and living in Quebec. Periodic nationally representative surveys of symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, are required in many countries to understand the pandemic and prepare for the future.

The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal sequence pattern ofPlasmodium falciparuminfections in the first year of life within a birth cohort in Kintampo, Ghana (N = 1855). Infants were monitored at home with monthly sampling and also at the clinic for any febrile illness between 2008 and 2011. Light microscopy was performed on monthly scheduled visits and febrile ill visits over twelve months of follow-ups (n = 19231). Microscopy-positive visits accompanied with or without symptoms were rare during the first five months of life but were common from six to twelve months of age. Among 1264 infants with microscopy data over a minimum of eight monthly visits and also throughout in sick visits, some were microscopy negative (36%), and others positive: only-symptomatic (35%), alternating (22%) and only-asymptomatic (7%). The median age of microscopic infection was seven months for the alternating group and eight months for both the only-symptomatic and only-asymptomatic groups. The alternating group had the highest cumulative incidence of microscopic infections, the lowest age at first infection and 87 different infection patterns. Parasite densities detected by microscopy were significantly higher for symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection. We conclude that infants in malaria endemic areas experience diverse infection profiles throughout their first year of life. Further investigations should include submicroscopic reservoir and may shed more light on the factors that determine susceptibility to malaria during infancy.

Associations of intimate partner violence and reproductive coercion with contraceptive use in Uttar Pradesh, India: How associations differ across contraceptive methods	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNINTENDED PREGNANCY; ABORTION; SAMPLE; HIV	Intimate partner violence (IPV) and reproductive coercion (RC)-largely in the form of pressuring pregnancy-appear to contribute to low use of contraceptives in India; however, little is known about the extent to which these experiences differentially affect use of specific contraceptive methods. The current study assessed the association of IPV and RC with specific contraceptive methods (Intrauterine Devices [IUDs], pills, condoms) among a large population-based sample of currently married women (15-49 years, n = 1424) living in Uttar Pradesh. Outcomes variables included past year modern contraceptive use and type of contraceptive used. Primary independent variables included lifetime experience of RC by current husband or in-laws, and lifetime experiences of physical IPV and sexual IPV by current husband. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to determine the effect of each form of abuse on women's contraceptive use. Approximately 1 in 7 women (15.1%) reported experiencing RC from their current husband or in-laws ever in their lifetime, 37.4% reported experience of physical IPV and 8.3% reported experience of sexual IPV by their current husband ever in their lifetime. Women experiencing RC were less likely to use any modern contraceptive (AOR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.9-0.36). Such women also less likely to report pill and condom use but were more likely to report IUD use. Neither form of IPV were associated with either overall or method specific contraceptive use. Study findings highlight that RC may influence contraceptive use differently based on type of contraceptive, with less detectable, female-controlled contraceptives such as IUD preferred in the context of women facing RC. Unfortunately, IUD uptake remains low in India. Increased access and support for use, particularly for women contending with RC, may be important for improving women's control over contraceptive use and reducing unintended pregnancy.

A costing analysis of a measles and rubella serosurvey in southern Zambia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IMMUNIZATION	Background Serosurveys are a valuable surveillance tool because they provide a more direct measure of population immunity to infectious diseases, such as measles and rubella, than vaccination coverage estimates. However, there is concern that serological surveys are costly. We adapted a framework to capture the costs associated with conducting a serosurvey in Zambia. Methods We costed a nested serosurvey in Southern Province, Zambia that collected dried blood spots from household residents in a post-campaign vaccine coverage survey. The financial costs were estimated using an ingredients-based costing approach. Inputs included personnel, transportation, field consumable items, social mobilization, laboratory supplies, and capital items, and were classified by serosurvey function (survey preparation, data collection, biospecimen collection, laboratory testing, and coordination). Inputs were stratified by whether they were applicable to surveys in general or attributable specifically to serosurveys. Finally, we calculated the average cost per cluster and participant. Results We estimated the total nested serosurvey cost was US $68,558 to collect dried blood spots from 658 participants in one province in Zambia. A breakdown of the cost by serosurvey phase showed data collection accounted for almost one third of the total serosurvey cost (32%), followed by survey preparation (25%) and biospecimen collection (20%). Analysis by input categories indicated personnel costs were the largest contributing input to overall serosurvey costs (51%), transportation was second (23%), and field consumables were third (9%). By combining the serosurvey with a vaccination coverage survey, there was a savings of $43,957. We estimated it cost $4,285 per average cluster and $104 per average participant sampled. Conclusions Adding serological specimen collection to a planned vaccination coverage survey provided a more direct measurement of population immunity among a wide age group but increased the cost by approximately one-third. Future serosurveys could consider ways to leverage existing surveys conducted for other purposes to minimize costs.

Aim This study assessed the prevalence ofCampylobacter, antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genetic factors, and risk ofCampylobacterinfection associated with living in close proximity to domestic animals in HIV patients with gastric enteritis at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana. Methods Resistance to different antibiotics was assessed with Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. In addition, all theCampylobacterisolates were tested for ampicillin (bla(OXA-61)), erythromycin (aph-3-1), tetracyclinetet(O), streptomycin (aadE), and the energy-dependent multi-drug efflux pump (cmeB) resistance genes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results Out of a total of 140 (97 females and 43 males) tested patients, 71 (50.7%) patients were positive forCampylobacter coli. Female patients aged within 31-40 years (31.6%) and 41-50 years (31.6%) had high frequency ofCampylobacterinfection. Most of the infected patients lived in close proximity to chickens (53.5%), however, some patients (14.1%) lived in close proximity to goats. Phenotypic resistance evaluation revealed widespread resistance to ampicillin (100%), tetracycline (100%), ciprofloxacin (71.8%), erythromycin (69%), and gentamicin (49.3%). However, limited no of isolates containedbla(OXA-61)(1.41%),cmeB (7.0%) andtet(O (7.0%) resistance genes. Conclusion HIV patients with gastric enteritis were infected with resistantCampylobacter coli. Further studies are required to examine correlation of infected patients withC.coliand risk of living in close proximity to poultry birds. There is the need for routine investigation ofCampylobacterin patients with gastroenteritis in order to assist in the development of strategies for combating diseases involving resistant zoonotic bacteria strains.

Variation of stress levels, burnout, and resilience throughout the academic year in first-year medical students	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUICIDAL IDEATION; MENTAL-HEALTH; DISTRESS; PREVALENCE; WELLNESS; QUALITY; GENDER; SCHOOL; LIFE; RACE	Medical student wellness is of great concern in the health care field. A growing number of studies point to increases in suicide, depression, anxiety, mood disorders, and burnout related to physician lifestyles. Mental health issues commencing in medical school have been suggested to have a significant impact on future physician lifestyle and burnout. Tracking the mental health of medical students at the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences (UTCOMLS) with standardized indices will help elucidate triggers of poor mental health. Anonymous surveys were developed and distributed to preclinical medical students at five strategic time points throughout the 2018 2019 academic year. Surveys collected basic demographic information as well as inventories measuring perceived stress, burnout, resilience, and mindfulness. 172 M1s (83 males and 89 females) were included in the study and average response rate for the first 4 (out of 5) surveys averaged 74.8%. M1 males and females had on average increased personal burnout over time with females consistently scoring higher. Both males and females had an increase in stress from August to each subsequent month (p<0.05). Females reported a higher level of perceived stress than males in the beginning and middle of the academic year (p<0.05). Both males and females report a gradual decrease in resiliency throughout the academic year. These surveys demonstrated over half of males and females in medical school reported higher perceived stress scores than their gender-matched peers in the general United States population. Our study strengthens documented trends in resiliency, perceived stress, and burnout amongst medical students. More study in designing targeted approaches to ameliorate these findings in the medical student population is warranted.

Outcomes in relation to antithrombotic therapy among patients with atrial fibrillation after percutaneous coronary intervention	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTAGONIST ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS; DUAL-ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; STROKE PREVENTION; ARTERY-DISEASE; ASIAN PATIENTS; PREVALENCE	Backgrounds We investigated the prognostic impact of antithrombotic regimens at 1-year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Method and results A total of 13,278 AF patients who underwent PCI from 2009 to 2013 were selected from Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Patients were categorized by antithrombotic regimens at 1-year after PCI: (1) OAC with or without single antiplatelet (OAC +/- SAPT); (2) triple therapy (TT) and (3) antiplatelets (APT) only. After propensity score matching, composite ischaemia (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), composite bleeding (intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding), and a composite clinical outcome (composite ischaemia and bleeding) were compared. Of total population, 1,100 (8.3%), 746 (5.6%), and 11,432 (86.1%) were treated with OAC +/- SAPT, TT, and APT only, respectively. Compared to OAC +/- SAPT group, the TT group had significantly higher risk of the composite clinical outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-2.13) attributed to a higher trend in both ischaemia (HR 1.63, 95% CI 0.99-2.67) and bleeding (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.69-2.13). The APT only group showed a higher risk of ischaemia (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.25-2.74), despite a lower risk of bleeding (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.94) compared to OAC +/- SAPT group. Conclusions OAC +/- SAPT was associated with better clinical outcomes compared to TT or APT only treatments, beyond 1-year after PCI among Asians with AF.

This study determined the prevalence of C. kefyr among yeast isolates collected during 2011-2018 in Kuwait. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AST) and genotypic heterogeneity among C. kefyr was also studied. Methods Clinical C. kefyr isolates recovered from bloodstream and other specimens during 2011 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All C. kefyr isolates were identified by CHROMagar Candida, Vitek2 and PCR amplification of rDNA. AST was performed by Etest. Molecular basis of resistance to fluconazole and echinocandins was studied by PCR-sequencing of ERG11 and FKS1, respectively. Genotypic heterogeneity was determined with microsatellite-/minisatellite-based primers and for 27 selected isolates by PCR-sequencing of IGS1 region of rDNA. Results Among 8257 yeast strains, 69 C. kefyr (including four bloodstream) isolates were detected by phenotypic and molecular methods. Isolation from urine and respiratory samples from female and male patients was significantly different (P = 0.001). Four isolates showed reduced susceptibility to amphotericin B and one isolate to all (amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole and caspofungin/micafungin) antifungals tested. Fluconazole-resistant isolate contained only synonymous mutations in ERG11. Echinocandin-resistant isolate contained wild-type hotspot-1 and hotspot-2 of FKS1. Fingerprinting with microsatellite-/minisatellite-based primers identified only three types. IGS1 sequencing identified seven haplotypes among 27 selected isolates. Conclusions The overall prevalence of C. kefyr among clinical yeast isolates and among candidemia cases was recorded as 0.83% and 0.32%, respectively. The frequency of isolation of C. kefyr from bloodstream and other invasive samples was stable during the study period. The C. kefyr isolates grown from invasive (bloodstream, bronchoalveolar lavage, abdominal drain fluid, peritonial fluid and gastric fluid) samples and amphotericin B-resistant isolates were genotypically heterogeneous strains.

Risk factors for development of acute kidney injury in hospitalised adults in Zimbabwe	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ACUTE-RENAL-FAILURE; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; NEPHROLOGY; OUTCOMES; DISEASE; CARE	Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is predominantly a disease of low and middle-income countries. Despite this, there is a particular paucity of data regarding AKI in Africa. Most published studies were conducted prior to the most recent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition of AKI. This prospective, observational, cohort study examines AKI amongst newly admitted acute medical inpatients in a large, urban, tertiary hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methods All newly admitted, adult, medical patients in separate, randomly selected, 24-hour periods were included. Baseline demographic information, comorbidities, nephrotoxic medication use, and reason for admission were recorded on a standardised data capture record. A serum creatinine measurement was performed on all patients at the time of admission and again after 48 hours. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation and AKI was defined using the most recent KDIGO definition as an increase in the serum creatinine of greater than 26.5 mu mol/L within 48 hours, with admission creatinine used as a baseline measurement. Results 253 patients were included in the analysis; 137 patients (54.2%) were female; 100 patients (39.5%) had HIV infection. 36 patients (14.2%) met the KDIGO criteria for AKI during the 48-hour follow-up period. AKI was more common among males (19.8% vs 9.5%; p = 0.019). The AKI group had a higher serum creatinine at presentation than those without AKI (296.5 mu mol/L vs 91.0 mu mol/L; p<0.001) and at 48 hours (447.7 mu mol/L vs 77.1 mu mol/L; p<0.001). In logistic regression, AKI was related negatively to female sex (OR 0.461, 95% CI 0.211, 1.003; p = 0.051) and positively predicted by the presence of comorbid hypertension (OR 3.292, 95% CI 1.52, 7.128; p = 0.003) and chronic kidney disease (OR 6.034, 95% 1.792, 20.313; p = 0.004). Conclusions KDIGO-defined AKI was common in hospitalised patients in Sub-Saharan Africa and was predicted by male sex, a history of comorbid hypertension and a history of comorbid chronic kidney disease.

Improved taxonomic classification of Iris species, particularly the endangered Korean-native Iris, is needed for correct species delineation. To this end, identification of diverse genetic markers from Iris genomes would facilitate molecular identification and resolve ambiguous classifications from molecular analyses; however, only two Iris plastid genomes, from Iris gatesii and Iris sanguinea, have been sequenced. Here, we used high-throughput next-generation sequencing, combined with Sanger sequencing, to construct the plastid genomes of 14 Korean-native Iris species with one outgroup and predict their gene content. Using these data, combined with previously published plastid genomes from Iris and one outgroup (Sisyrinchium angustifolium), we constructed a Bayesian phylogenetic tree showing clear speciation among the samples. We further identified sub-genomic regions that have undergone neutral evolution and accurately recapitulate Bayesian-inferred speciation. These contain key markers that could be used to identify and classify Iris samples into taxonomic clades. Our results confirm previously reported speciation patterns and resolve questionable relationships within the Iris genus. These data also provide a valuable resource for studying genetic diversity and refining phylogenetic relationships between Iris species.

One potential source of variation is in the thawing of cryopreserved samples, typically carried out in water baths. This study looks at an alternative, dry thawing, to minimise variability in the thawing of a cryopreserved cell therapy, and compares the cellular outcome on thaw. Factors such as storage time, patient age, and gender are considered in terms of cryopreservation and thawing outcomes. Cryopreserved leukapheresis samples from 41 donors, frozen by the same protocol and stored for up to 17 years, have been thawed using automated, water-free equipment and by conventional wet thawing using a water bath. Post-thaw viability, assessed by both trypan blue and flow cytometry, showed no significant differences between the techniques. Similarly, there was no negative effect of the duration of frozen storage, donor age at sample collection or donor gender on post-thaw viability using either thawing method. The implication of these results is that the cryopreservation protocol chosen initially remains robust and appropriate for use with a wide range of donors. The positive response of the samples to water-free thawing offers potential benefits for clinical situations by removing the subjective element inherent in water bath thawing and eliminating possible contamination issues.

Sedentary behaviour has been identified as potentially modifiable dangerous factors for many diseases. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between sedentary behaviour and the risk of anxiety symptoms in youth. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association among youth in 24 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods Data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) were analyzed in 59587 youth aged 12-15 years. Most of the country-wide data were nationally representative. Anxiety symptoms were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analyses of country-wise estimates were conducted. Results The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 10.3%. Countrywide meta-analysis demonstrated that sedentary behaviour of >2 h/day (vs.<= 2 h/day) was associated with an increased risk of anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.10-1.37). Conclusions This study provides multi-national evidence of the dangerous effect of sedentary behaviour against anxiety symptoms among youth in LMICs. Decreasing the level of sedentary behaviour during adolescence could be an important target for reducing the prevalence of anxiety.

A cross-sectional study was conducted using nationally representative samples from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010. Significant hepatic fibrosis was defined as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index>1.3. Zinc level was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess risk factors for significant hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. A total of 300 patients with NAFLD were analyzed in this study. The mean serum zinc level was 139.8 +/- 29.9 mu g/dL. FIB-4 index was significantly increased as the serum zinc level decreased (Adjusted correlation coefficient = -0.177, p = 0.003). Significant liver fibrosis was observed in 62 patients (21%). The multivariable analysis showed that significant liver fibrosis in NAFLD was associated with diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 3.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-6.19; p0.001), male (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.31-5.12; p = 0.006), and zinc level <140 mu g/dL (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.94; p = 0.015). There was an inverse relationship between serum zinc level and FIB-4 index in NAFLD. Low levels of serum zinc were an independent risk factor for significant hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD.

The development and validation of the Videogaming Motives Questionnaire (VMQ)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTERNET GAMING DISORDER; VIDEO GAME ADDICTION; ROLE-PLAYING GAMES; WORLD-OF-WARCRAFT; STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS; PSYCHIATRIC-SYMPTOMS; DRINKING MOTIVES; ONLINE; MOTIVATIONS; GRATIFICATIONS	Gaming motives are important factors for explaining individual differences in videogame-related behaviors. The aim of the present study was to develop a new comprehensive but brief instrument-the Videogaming Motives Questionnaire (VMQ)-which embraces some of the most relevant gaming motives. In a first study, a pilot exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with data from 140 undergraduates was performed on items from twelve potential motives. This identified eight main factors: recreation, social interaction, coping, violent reward, fantasy, cognitive development, customization, and competition. In Studies 2 and 3, an EFA and a confirmatory factor analysis were performed on two independent samples of 407 adolescents and 260 young adults, respectively. The VMQ presented a robust eight-factor structure, with all scales showing adequate reliability indices. In reference to criterion validity, all motives presented specific associations with hours spent playing videogames, disordered gaming, and game genre preferences. More specifically, and in both adolescents and young adults, social interaction was the main motive related to time spent gaming, whereas disordered gaming was related to both coping and social interaction motives. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the VMQ is a brief and psychometrically appropriate tool for assessing the most relevant videogaming motives.

We combined established findings on effective instruction with emerging research addressing the specific needs of disadvantaged students. A sample of N = 260 disadvantaged 6th-graders received 4 weeks (15 lessons) of fraction instruction either as usual or evidence-based instruction, with and without digital learning support (i.e., interactivity, adaptivity, and immediate explanatory feedback). To examine the sustainability of effects, we assessed students' fraction knowledge immediately after the 4 weeks and once again after a period of additional 8 weeks. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that students only benefitted from evidence-based instruction if digital support was available in addition. Digital support principles implemented in evidence-based instruction helped disadvantaged students to acquire mathematics knowledge-and to maintain this knowledge.

J	Sasaki, K; Yamamoto, S; Mutoh, T				Sasaki, Kazumasu; Yamamoto, Shuzo; Mutoh, Tatsushi			Noninvasive assessment of fluid responsiveness for emergency abdominal surgery in dogs with pulmonary hypertension: Insights into high-risk companion animal anesthesia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PULSE PRESSURE VARIATION; STROKE VOLUME VARIATION; RAPID INHALATION INDUCTION; CARDIAC-OUTPUT; TRANSPULMONARY THERMODILUTION; MASK INDUCTION; ELECTRICAL VELOCIMETRY; HEMODYNAMIC MANAGEMENT; NITROUS-OXIDE; HEART-FAILURE	Objective Optimizing cardiac stroke volume during high-risk surgical anesthesia is of particular interest with regard to a therapeutic target to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. However, intensive fluid management in critically ill small animals with pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been empirically performed, and thus it can be challenging. Stroke volume variation (SVV) has been used as a dynamic preload predictor of fluid responsiveness. We hypothesized that if SVV exhibited robust reliability in the setting of hemodynamically unstable condition, it would provide more precise information on fluid resuscitation to translate it into veterinary anesthesia. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate the utility of SVV measured by the electrical velocimetry (EV) method for predicting fluid responsiveness in dogs with PH. Methods Sixteen dogs undergoing emergency abdominal surgery and diagnosed with PH secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) on preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram were included. Dogs were randomly assigned to 2 groups with and without inotropic cardiac support with dobutamine. Hemodynamic measurements including stroke volume and SVV derived from the EV device were performed under general anesthesia before (baseline) and after surgery (fluid challenge with a colloid solution defined by a SV increase of >= 10%). Results In both groups, SVV elevated significantly after abdominal surgery compared with baseline. In dobutamine infused group, the SVV values decreased significantly after fluid challenge (P < 0.05) with a greater number of responders than saline infused control group (P < 0.01). Receiver operating curve analysis of SVV confirmed high positive predictive value for dogs during dobutamine infusion (P < 0.05; cut-off value of 15%; specificity 90%, sensitivity 82%). Conclusions Noninvasive EV monitoring may be useful for the prediction of fluid responsiveness in critically ill dogs with left-sided heart failure-related PH. This normalization of dynamic preload indices, which could be achieved more precisely under inotropic support, may prevent further detrimental consequence of fluid loading.

Age- and refraction-related changes in anterior segment anatomical structures measured by swept-source anterior segment OCT	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; CILIARY MUSCLE THICKNESS; BODY THICKNESS; ACCOMMODATION; CHAMBER; DOMAIN; MORPHOLOGY; AGREEMENT; ERROR	Purpose To assess the effects of age and refractive status on anterior segment anatomical structures, including the ciliary body, using a new swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) device. Methods This prospective observational study included 63 healthy volunteers (mean age: 44.2 years). Images of the anterior segment were obtained using a new swept-source AS-OCT (ANTERION, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) with tracking and image averaging from the right eye of all participants. Repeatability as well as inter- and intra-observer reliability of biometric measurements were evaluated. The impact of image tracking and averaging on ciliary muscle measurements was tested. Univariate and multivariable statistical models were developed to evaluate the relationship of age and refractive status on anterior segment biometric measurements. Results For all test-retest repeatability and inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of swept-source AS-OCT measurements, high intraclass correlation (ICC) was noted (0.88-1.00). The nasal maximum ciliary muscle thickness (CMTMAX) and distance between scleral spur to the thickest point of the ciliary muscle (SSMAX) were larger than those on the temporal side (p0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively). Nasal and temporal CMTMAX (p = 0.004 and p0.001, respectively) and lens thickness (p0.01) increased with age. Nasal and temporal SSMAX decreased with older age and increasing hyperopia (p = 0.01 and p0.001, respectively). Image averaging resulted in improved ciliary muscle measurements (p = 0.008 to 0.02). Lens vault increased with older age and increased hyperopia (p0.01). OCT measurements of the angle decreased with older age and increased hyperopia (p0.001 to 0.03). Aqueous depth decreased with older age and increased hyperopia (p0.01). Pupil diameter decreased with older age (p0.01). Conclusions Repeatability and reproducibility of biometric measurements using the ANTERION AS-OCT were excellent. Image averaging improved the accuracy of ciliary muscle measurements. The device produced measurements of biometric parameters that described superficial and deep structures including the ciliary body and full lens thickness from a single image.

J	Pinho, RH; Leach, MC; Minto, BW; Rocha, FD; Luna, SPL				Pinho, Renata Haddad; Leach, Matthew C.; Minto, Bruno Watanabe; Rocha, Fabiana Del Lama; Loureiro Luna, Stelio Pacca			Postoperative pain behaviours in rabbits following orthopaedic surgery and effect of observer presence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ZEALAND WHITE-RABBITS; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; BUPRENORPHINE; ANALGESIA; SCALE; CARPROFEN; HYPERALGESIA; EXPOSURE; ANIMALS; MODEL	Rabbits are widely used in studies focusing on pain. However, pain is undertreated in this species and one possible factor to explain this is the lack of evaluation methods. The objective of this study was to identify behaviours related to orthopaedic pain in rabbits and to evaluate the influence of the presence of an observer on these behaviours. Twenty-eight rabbits undergoing orthopaedic surgery and filmed 24 hours before surgery, and 1 hour (before rescue analgesia), 4 hours (3 hours after rescue analgesia), and 24 hours post-recovery were observed in the presence and absence of an observer. The frequency and/or duration of behaviours were compared over time and between the presence and absence of the observer using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests respectively. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range and a significant difference was considered when p<0.05. At 1 hour post-recovery, the rabbits showed reduced activity, hopping, change posture, position in the cage, explore, and open eyes in both the presence and absence of the observer. In the absence of the observer, quadrupedal posture, interact with pinecone, and eat carrot also decreased, while wince behaviour increased. In the presence of the observer, before surgery, the rabbits were less active (Presence-280; 162-300, Absence-300; 300-300) and presented a lower duration of explore (Presence-3; 0-32, Absence-40; 4-63). Post-recovery the rabbits flinched less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-1) and suspended the affected limb less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-65). After rescue analgesia the rabbits put weight on and raised the affected limb less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-2) and licked the affected area less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-2). These findings demonstrate that the presence of the observer inhibited pain-free behaviours in the rabbits, leading to a false impression of pain, and after the surgery the rabbits masked some pain signs related to the affected area.

Screening for modulators of neural network activity in 3D human iPSC-derived cortical spheroids	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; MUTATION; MODEL	Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) are a powerful tool to dissect the biology of complex human cell types such as those of the central nervous system (CNS). However, robust, high-throughput platforms for reliably measuring activity in human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures are lacking. Here, we assessed 3D cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes displaying spontaneous, rhythmic, and highly synchronized neural activity that can be visualized as calcium oscillations on standard high-throughput fluorescent readers as a platform for CNS-based discovery efforts. Spontaneous activity and spheroid structure were highly consistent from well-to-well, reference compounds such as TTX, 4-AP, AP5, and NBQX, had expected effects on neural spontaneous activity, demonstrating the presence of functionally integrated neuronal circuitry. Neurospheroid biology was challenged by screening the LOPAC((R) 1280)library, a collection of 1280 pharmacologically active small molecules. The primary screen identified 111 compounds (8.7%) that modulated neural network activity across a wide range of neural and cellular processes and 16 of 17 compounds chosen for follow-up confirmed the primary screen results. Together, these data demonstrate the suitability and utility of human iPSC-derived neurospheroids as a screening platform for CNS-based drug discovery.

To increase their resistance to strong winds, sign boards are perforated. Using computational fluid dynamics simulations, the wind load resistance of traffic signs with holes was optimised. By comparing the solutions to different turbulence models with empirical results, it was found that the simulation results of the re-normalisation group (RNG) model have the smallest error. Therefore, the RNG model is used to simulate the wind load of traffic sign boards with different perforation diameters and different hole spacings under different wind speeds. By analysing the wind pressure distribution on the surface of the perforated traffic sign board, the perforation scheme for different regions of the sign board under different wind loads was obtained. The results show that reasonable perforation diameters and hole spacings can reduce the wind load and improve the wind load resistance of sign boards. This study provides decision-makers with useful information for installing traffic signs in areas affected with strong winds, thereby improving the wind resistance of traffic signs and ensuring traffic safety.

J	Ratzon, E; Dershowitz, N				Ratzon, Eshbal; Dershowitz, Nachum			The length of a scroll: Quantitative evaluation of material reconstructions	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Scholars have used mathematical models to estimate the missing length of deteriorated scrolls from ancient Egypt, Qumran, Herculaneum, and elsewhere. Based on such estimations, the content of ancient literature as well as the process of its composition is deduced. Though theoretically reasonable, many practical problems interfere with the method. In the current study, the empirical validity of these mathematical models is examined, showing that highly significant errors are quite frequent. When applied to comparatively intact scrolls, the largest contribution to errors is the subjectivity inherent in measuring patterns of damaged areas. In less well preserved scrolls, deterioration and deformation are more central causes of errors. Another factor is the quality of imaging. Hence, even after maximal reduction of interfering factors, one should only use these estimation methods in conjunction with other supporting considerations. Accordingly, past uses of this approach should be reevaluated, which may have substantial implications for the study of antiquity.

Barriers and facilitators of tuberculosis infection prevention and control in low- and middle-income countries from the perspective of healthcare workers: A systematic review	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; KNOWLEDGE; IMPLEMENTATION; ADHERENCE; CENTERS; BURDEN	Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Transmission is the dominant mechanism sustaining the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic. Tuberculosis infection prevention and control (TBIPC) guidelines for healthcare facilities are poorly implemented. This systematic review aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators of implementation of TBIPC guidelines in low- and middle-income countries from the perspective of healthcare workers. Two separate reviewers carried out an electronic database search to select qualitative and quantitative studies exploring healthcare workers attitudes towards TBIPC. Eligible studies underwent thematic synthesis. Derived themes were further organised into a macro-, meso- and micro-level framework, which allows us to analyse barriers at different levels of the healthcare system. We found that most studies focused on assessing implementation within facilities in accordance with the hierarchy of TBIPC measures-administrative, environmental and respiratory protection controls. TBIPC implementation was over-estimated by self-report compared with what researchers observed within facilities, indicating a knowledge-action gap. Macro-level barriers included the lack of coordination of integrated HIV/tuberculosis care, in the context of an expanding antiretroviral therapy programme and hence increasing opportunity for nosocomial acquisition of tuberculosis; a lack of funding; and ineffective occupational health policies, such as poor systems for screening for tuberculosis amongst healthcare workers. Meso-level barriers included little staff training to implement programmes, and managers not understanding policy sufficiently to translate it into an IPC programme. Most studies reported micro-level barriers including the impact of stigma, work culture, lack of perception of risk, poor supply and use of respirators and difficulty sensitising patients to the need for IPC. Existing literature on healthcare workers' attitudes to TBIPC focusses on collecting data about poor implementation at facility level. In order to bridge the knowledge-action gap, we need to understand how best to implement policy, taking account of the context.

Social network determinants of alcohol and tobacco use: A qualitative study among out of school youth in South Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ADOLESCENT CIGARETTE-SMOKING; CAPE-TOWN; FAMILY-STRUCTURE; SUBSTANCE USE; DROPOUT; INTERNET; POLICY; INTERVIEWS; FRIENDSHIP; PREVENTION	An important determinant of alcohol and tobacco use is the adolescent's social network, which has not been explored among out of school youth (OSY). OSY are adolescents not currently enrolled in school and have not completed their schooling. This study aims to qualitatively understand how OSY's social networks support or constrain alcohol and tobacco use. Respondent-driven sampling was used to select 41 OSY (aged 13-20 years) for individual in-depth interviews in a South African urban area. The data were analysed using content analysis. Smoking and drinking friends, family close in age to OSY that drank and smoked, and lack of parental support were associated with alcohol and tobacco use among OSY. Household norms, romantic partners and non-smoking or non-drinking friends were suggested to mitigate alcohol and tobacco use. Understanding how the social network of OSY plays a role in alcohol and tobacco use is useful for gaining an insight into the profile of OSY at risk for alcohol and tobacco use. Registration of OSY youth and community-based peer led programmes that include influential OSY family and friends could be beneficial.

In this paper we assess the 1918-flu long-term effects not just ofin uteroexposure but also during infancy and early childhood. A unique set of events that took place in Puerto Rico during 1918-1919 generated conditions of a "double quasi-natural experiment". We exploit these conditions to empirically identify effects of exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic and those of the devastation left by an earthquake-tsunami that struck the island in 1918. Because the earthquake-tsunami affected mostly the Western coast of the island whereas early (in uteroand postnatal) exposure to the flu was restricted to those born in the interval 1917-1920, we use geographic variation to identify the effects of the quake and timing of birth variation to identify those of the flu. We benefit from availability of information on markers of nutritional status in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 75 and older in 2002. We make two contributions. First, unlike most fetal-origins research that singles out early nutritional status as adeterminant of adult health, we hypothesize that the 1918 flu damaged the nutritional status of adult survivors who, at the time of the flu, werein uteroor infants. Second, we target markers of nutritional status largely set when the adult survivors were infants and young children. Estimates of effects of the pandemic are quite large mostly among females and those who were exposed to the earthquake-tsunami. Impacts of the flu in areas less affected by the earthquake are smaller but do vary by area flu severity. These findings constitute empirical evidence supporting the conjecture that effects of the 1918 flu and/or the earthquake are associated not just with disruption experienced during the fetal period but also postnatally.

J	Hiroyasu, EGM; Yotsumoto, Y				Gallego Hiroyasu, Elisa M.; Yotsumoto, Yuko			Older adults preserve accuracy but not precision in explicit and implicit rhythmic timing	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; TIME-ESTIMATION; WORKING-MEMORY; PERCEPTION; DURATION; ATTENTION; DISCRIMINATION; JUDGMENTS; INTERVAL; SYSTEM	Aging brings with it several forms of neurophysiological and cognitive deterioration, but whether a decline in temporal processing is part of the aging process is unclear. The current study investigated whether this timing deficit has a cause independent of those of memory and attention using rhythmic stimuli that reduce the demand for these higher cognitive functions. In Study 1, participants took part in two rhythmic timing tasks: explicit and implicit. Participants had to distinguish regular from irregular sequences while processing temporal information explicitly or implicitly. Results showed that while the accuracy in the implicit timing task was preserved, older adults had more noise in their performance in the explicit and implicit tasks. In Study 2, participants took part in a dual-implicit task to explore whether the performance of temporal tasks differed with increasing task difficulty. We found that increasing task difficulty magnifies age-related differences.

It is not understood whether synergistic effects may exist between them. Objective We aim to investigate three provider wellness markers and determine their associations with provider self-reported medical errors and intent-to-leave outcomes among Emergency Department (ED) providers. Design This is a multi-center retrospective study. Method Three wellness domains include professional fulfillment (PF), burnout (BO), and personal resilience (PR). Two outcomes measured as provider self-reported medical errors and provider intent-to-leave. Correlations between wellness markers and outcomes were analyzed. When adjusted for other confounders (provider demographics, provider experience, and operational environment), a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to further determine the interactions among these three domains on provider wellness affecting patient and provider related outcomes. Results Total 242 surveys were collected from providers at 16 different EDs. The median score of PF were 2.83 among physicians and 2.67 among APPs, BO were 1.00 (physicians) and 0.95 (APPs), and PR were 0.88 (physicians) and 0.81 (APPs). The median scores of self-reported medical errors were 1.50 (physicians) and 0.95 (APPs), and intent-to-leave were 1.00 (physicians and APPs). High correlations occurred among PF, BO, and PR. When analyzed together, high PF, low BO, and high PR functioned as a protective effect on provider intent-to-leave (adjusted odds ratios = 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.30). Conclusion High correlations occurred among three provider wellness markers with no significant difference between physicians and APPs. Providers with high PR, low BO, and high PR tended to be more stable in their jobs.

The present study therefore sought to identify novel sex-related biomarkers of bevacizumab/erlotinib (BE) responses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods The exon array data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset were analyzed in order to identify patterns of mRNA and lncRNA expression associated with BE resistance in NSCLC. These differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified via DE Analysis Filtering. These DE mRNAs were then assessed for their potential functional roles via pathway enrichment analyses, with overlapping functions possibly associated with the BE resistance. The mRNAs in these overlapping groups were then assessed for their correlations with patient survival, and lncRNA-mRNA co-expression networks were generated for each patient subset. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also generated based upon these DE mRNAs. Results In females we identified 172 DE lncRNAs and 1766 DE mRNAs associated with BE responses, while in males we identified 78 DE lncRNAs and 485 DE mRNAs associated with such responses. Based on the overlap between these two datasets, we identified a total of 37 GO functions and 18 pathways associated with BE responses. Co-expression and PPI networks suggested that the key lncRNAs and mRNAs associated with these BE response mechanisms weredifferent in the male and female patients. Conclusions This work is the first to conduct a global profiling of the relationship between lncRNA and mRNA expression patterns, patient sex, and BE responses in individuals suffering from NSCLC. Together these results suggest that the integrative lncRNA-mRNA expression analyses may offer invaluable new therapeutic insights that can guide the tailored treatment of lung cancer in order to ensure optimal BE responses.

J	Huang, CF; Li, Q; Tian, SG				Huang, Changfu; Li, Qun; Tian, Shuguang			Research on prediction of residual deformation in goaf of steeply inclined extra-thick coal seam	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUBSIDENCE	The residual deformation of a goaf is studied to improve the foundation stability assessment for metro lines passing through the subsidence area of steeply inclined extra-thick coal seams. The variable mining influence propagation angle is introduced to describe the special form of the rock movement. Based on the modified parameters in the traditional probability integral model, a subsidence prediction model is established. Then, based on the idea of an equivalent mining thickness, Kelvin model is introduced to analyze the creep characteristics of the old goaf, and the dynamic prediction function of the residual subsidence is constructed to realize the dynamic analysis of the residual deformation. Moreover, a case study is used to evaluate the predictive effectiveness of the prediction model, and the results are compared with the monitoring data and numerical simulation results. The results show that the values with a relative error between the predicted value and measured value are in the range of +/- 7%, indicating that the prediction model based on the mining influence propagation angle is feasible. Thus, the residual deformation prediction model based on the mining influence propagation angle is considered to be suitable for predicting the subsidence of engineering projects crossing a goaf.

The clinicopathologic features, prognostic factors and multimodality treatment regimens of LELC remain inconclusive. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to address this deficit in current knowledge. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to filtrate studies investigating on clinical features and prognostic factors of LELC up to Sep 9(th), 2020. Fixed and random effect models were generated to present the incorporated hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality and heterogeneity of the included studies were also evaluated carefully. Results This systematic review and meta-analysis included 13 retrospective studies with a total of 1294 patients. The incidence of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in PPLELC varied from 63.3% to 75.8%. Positive PD-L1 expression was more likely to be found in patients under 60 years old (OR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.19-3.89, P = 0.01) and was associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS) compared with negative PD-L1 expression (HR = 2.99, 95%CI: 1.23-7.28, P = 0.02). The pooled results showed that stage was the prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and DFS. Moreover, a significantly better outcome of PPLELC was observed in men (HR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.33-0.95, P = 0.03) and patients who received radiation (HR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.22-0.96, P = 0.04). Conclusion PD-L1 expression was high in PPLELC patients. It was significantly associated with age under 60 and the unfavorable DFS. Stage and gender could be the prognostic factor for OS. Radiation could be the effective therapy for PPLELC.

Are quantitative features of lung nodules reproducible at different CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RADIATION-DOSE REDUCTION; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; PULMONARY NODULES; TEXTURE FEATURES; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; IMAGES; QUANTIFICATION; SIMULATION	Consistency and duplicability in Computed Tomography (CT) output is essential to quantitative imaging for lung cancer detection and monitoring. This study of CT-detected lung nodules investigated the reproducibility of volume-, density-, and texture-based features (outcome variables) over routine ranges of radiation dose, reconstruction kernel, and slice thickness. CT raw data of 23 nodules were reconstructed using 320 acquisition/reconstruction conditions (combinations of 4 doses, 10 kernels, and 8 thicknesses). Scans at 12.5%, 25%, and 50% of protocol dose were simulated; reduced-dose and full-dose data were reconstructed using conventional filtered back-projection and iterative-reconstruction kernels at a range of thicknesses (0.6-5.0 mm). Full-dose/B50f kernel reconstructions underwent expert segmentation for reference Region-Of-Interest (ROI) and nodule volume per thickness; each ROI was applied to 40 corresponding images (combinations of 4 doses and 10 kernels). Typical texture analysis metrics (including 5 histogram features, 13 Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix, 5 Run Length Matrix, 2 Neighboring Gray-Level Dependence Matrix, and 3 Neighborhood Gray-Tone Difference Matrix) were computed per ROI. Reconstruction conditions resulting in no significant change in volume, density, or texture metrics were identified as "compatible pairs" for a given outcome variable. Our results indicate that as thickness increases, volumetric reproducibility decreases, while reproducibility of histogram- and texture-based features across different acquisition and reconstruction parameters improves. To achieve concomitant reproducibility of volumetric and radiomic results across studies, balanced standardization of the imaging acquisition parameters is required.

J	Chen, HL; Chen, G; Pan, Y; Jin, XX				Chen, Hualin; Chen, Gang; Pan, Yang; Jin, Xiaoxiang			Three-gene prognostic biomarkers for seminoma identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; EXPRESSION; ASSOCIATION; PACKAGE; BREAST; ITGAM	Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are common in young males, and seminoma accounts for a large proportion of TGCTs. However, there are limited records on the exploration of novel biomarkers for seminoma. Hence, we aimed to identify new biomarkers associated with overall survival in seminoma. mRNA-seq and clinical traits of TGCTs were downloaded from UCSC XENA and analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. After intersection with differentially expressed genes in GSE8607, common genes were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and enrichment analyses. Then, the top 10 common genes were investigated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses and univariate Cox regression analyses. Ultimately, TYROBP, CD68, and ITGAM were considered three prognostic biomarkers in seminoma. Based on correlation analysis between these genes and immune infiltrates, we suggest that the three biomarkers influence the survival of seminoma patients, possibly through regulating the infiltration of immune cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TYROBP, CD68, and ITGAM could be regarded as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for seminoma patients.

Specific ablation of the NCoR corepressor delta splice variant reveals alternative RNA splicing as a key regulator of hepatic metabolism	PLOS ONE			English	Article							THYROID-HORMONE RECEPTOR; NUCLEAR RECEPTORS; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; LIPID-SYNTHESIS; RETINOIC ACID; SMRT; ALPHA; TRANSCRIPTION; REPRESSION; ISOFORMS	The NCoR corepressor plays critical roles in mediating transcriptional repression by both nuclear receptors and non-receptor transcription factors. Alternative mRNA splicing of NCoR produces a series of variants with differing molecular and biological properties. The NCoR omega splice-variant inhibits adipogenesis whereas the NCoR delta splice-variant promotes it, and mice bearing a splice-specific knockout of NCoR omega display enhanced hepatic steatosis and overall weight gain on a high fat diet as well as a greatly increased resistance to diet-induced glucose intolerance. We report here that the reciprocal NCoR delta splice-specific knock-out mice display the contrary phenotypes of reduced hepatic steatosis and reduced weight gain relative to the NCoR omega-/- mice. The NCoR delta-/- mice also fail to demonstrate the strong resistance to diet-induced glucose intolerance exhibited by the NCoR omega-/- animals. The NCoR delta and omega variants possess both unique and shared transcriptional targets, with expression of certain hepatic genes affected in opposite directions in the two mutants, others altered in one but not the other genotype, and yet others changed in parallel in both NCoR delta-/- and NCoR omega-/- animals versus WT. Gene set expression analysis (GSEA) identified a series of lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolic pathways that are likely to contribute to their distinct steatosis and glucose tolerance phenotypes. We conclude that alternative-splicing of the NCoR corepressor plays a key role in the regulation of hepatic energy storage and utilization, with the NCoR delta and NCoR omega variants exerting both opposing and shared functions in many aspects of this phenomenon and in the organism as a whole.

J	Tadic, B; Melnik, R				Tadic, Bosiljka; Melnik, Roderick			Modeling latent infection transmissions through biosocial stochastic dynamics	PLOS ONE			English	Article								The events of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.

Although larger sample sizes can help achieve higher disease surveillance sensitivity, the sample size is limited by the availability of resources in an emergency situation. Moreover, the recent CSF outbreak reported in Japan was associated with fewer clinical signs; this emphasizes the importance of detecting infected farms by surveillance. In this study, we aimed to identify effective and labor-efficient sampling methods showing high probabilities of detecting infection, by simulating infection and sampling in pigsties. We found that impartial sampling, which involves selection of pigs to be sampled from the four corners and the center of the pigsty, and random sampling showed comparable probabilities of detection. Impartial sampling involves sample collection without pig identification and random selection. Owing to its simplicity, impartial sampling is labor-efficient and thus a possible substitute for random sampling. In a group-housing pigsty, testing five pigs from five pens showed a higher detection probability than testing five pigs from one pen. These results suggest preferable surveillance methods for conducting emergency surveillance of infectious diseases.

Effective refolding of a cysteine rich glycoside hydrolase family 19 recombinant chitinase fromStreptomyces griseusby reverse dilution and affinity chromatography	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INCLUSION-BODIES; BINDING DOMAIN; PROTEINS; SOLUBILIZATION; PRESSURE; RECOVERY; ARGININE	Conventional refolding methods are associated with low yields due to misfolding and high aggregation rates or very dilute proteins. In this study, we describe the optimization of the conventional methods of reverse dilution and affinity chromatography for obtaining high yields of a cysteine rich recombinant glycoside hydrolase family 19 chitinase fromStreptomyces griseusHUT6037 (SgChiC). SgChiC is a potential biocontrol agent and a reference enzyme in the study and development of chitinases for various applications. The overexpression of SgChiC was previously achieved by periplasmic localization from where it was extracted by osmotic shock and then purified by hydroxyapatite column chromatography. In the present study, the successful refolding and recovery of recombinant SgChiC (r-SgChiC) from inclusion bodies (IB) by reverse dilution and column chromatography methods is respectively described. Approximately 8 mg of r-SgChiC was obtained from each method with specific activities of 28 and 52 U/mg respectively. These yields are comparable to that obtained from a 1 L culture volume of the same protein isolated from the periplasmic space ofE.coliBL21 (DE3) as described in previous studies. The higher yields obtained are attributed to the successful suppression of aggregation by a stepwise reduction of denaturant from high, to intermediate, and finally to low concentrations. These methods are straight forward, requiring the use of fewer refolding agents compared with previously described refolding methods. They can be applied to the refolding of other cysteine rich proteins expressed as inclusion bodies to obtain high yields of actively folded proteins. This is the first report on the recovery of actively folded SgChiC from inclusion bodies.

Methods We conducted a population-based study, the Montrachet study (Maculopathy Optic Nerve, nuTRition neurovAsCular, and HEarT disease), in participants aged >= 75 years. RNFL thickness was assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Analysis of the retinal vascular network was performed by means of the Singapore "I" Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software based on fundus photography. Results Data from 970 participants were suitable for analysis. Patients with optic neuropathy were excluded. In multivariable analysis, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in the caliber of the six largest arterioles and veins in zone B and the six largest arterioles and veins in zone C was associated with a decrease in global RNFL thickness (beta = -1.62 mu m,P= 0.001; beta = -2.39 mu m,P< 0.001; beta = -1.56 mu m,P= 0.002; and beta = -2.64 mu m,P< 0.001, respectively). Conclusions Our study found that decreased retinal vessels caliber were associated with a decreased RNFL thickness in the elderly without optic neuropathy.

Thus, reducing postoperative complications is a key target for cost-containment strategies. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between postoperative complications and hospital costs following small bowel resection. Methods Postoperative complications were recorded for 284 adult patients undergoing major small bowel resection surgery between January 2013 and June 2018. Complications were defined and graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. In-hospital cost of index admission was calculated using an activity-based costing methodology; it was reported in US dollars at 2019 rates. Regression modeling was used to investigate the relationships among a priori selected perioperative variables, complications, and costs. Findings The overall complication prevalence was 81.6% (95% CI: 85.7-77.5). Most complications (69%) were minor, but 22.9% of patients developed a severe complication (Clavien-Dindo grades III or IV). The unadjusted median total hospital cost for patients with any complication was 70% higher than patients without complications (median [IQR] USD 19,659.64 [13,545.81-35,407.14] vs. 11,551.88 [8,849.46-15,329.87], P < 0.001). The development of 1, 2, 3, and >= 4 complications increased hospital costs by 11%, 41%, 50%, and 195%, respectively. Similarly, more severe complications incurred higher hospital costs (P < 0.001). After adjustments were made (for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, anemia, surgical urgency and technique, intraoperative fluid administration, blood transfusion, and hospital readmissions), a greater number and increased severity of complications were associated with a higher adjusted median hospital cost. Patients who experienced complications had an adjusted additional median cost of USD 4,187.10 (95% CI: 1,264.89-7,109.31, P = 0.005) compared to those without complications. Conclusions Postoperative complications are a key target for cost-containment strategies. Our findings demonstrate a high prevalence of postoperative complications following small bowel resection surgery and quantify their associated increase in hospital costs.

Anthropometry, body fat composition and reproductive factors and risk of oesophageal and gastric cancer by subtype and subsite in the UK Biobank cohort	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MASS INDEX; ABDOMINAL OBESITY; MALE PREDOMINANCE; MILLION WOMEN; HORMONE USE; ADENOCARCINOMA; METAANALYSIS; ESTROGEN; CARDIA; POPULATION	Background Obesity has been positively associated with upper gastrointestinal cancers, but prospective data by subtype/subsite are limited. Obesity influences hormonal factors, which may play a role in these cancers. We examined anthropometry, body fat and reproductive factors in relation to oesophageal and gastric cancer by subtype/subsite in the UK Biobank cohort. Methods Among 458,713 UK Biobank participants, 339 oesophageal adenocarcinomas, 124 oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 137 gastric cardia and 92 gastric non-cardia cancers were diagnosed during a mean of 6.5 years follow-up. Cox models estimated multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Body mass index (BMI), hip circumference, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, total body fat and trunk fat were positively associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (highest vs lowest category: HR = 2.33, 95%-CI:1.65-3.28; HR = 1.56, 95%-CI:1.15-2.13; HR = 2.30, 95%-CI:1.47-3.57; HR = 1.71, 95%-CI:1.01-2.90; HR = 2.87, 95%-CI:1.88-4.38; HR = 1.96, 95%-CI:1.30-2.96; HR = 2.34, 95%-CI:1.70-3.22, respectively). Although there were no statistically significant associations in combined sex analyses, BMI (HR = 1.83, 95%-CI:1.00-3.37), waist circumference (HR = 2.21, 95%-CI:1.27-3.84) and waist-to-hip ratio (HR = 1.92, 95%-CI:1.11-3.29) were associated with gastric cardia cancer in men; however, mutual adjustment attenuated the associations for BMI and waist-to-hip ratio. For oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, statistically significant inverse associations were observed among women for BMI, hip circumference, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, total body fat and trunk fat, although they were based on small numbers. In addition, older age at first (HR = 0.44, 95%-CI:0.22-0.88) and last live birth (HR = 0.44, 95%-CI:0.22-0.87) were inversely associated with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and having a stillbirth/miscarriage/termination was positively associated (HR = 1.84, 95%-CI:1.10-3.07). Conclusions Obesity and abdominal obesity specifically may be a risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia cancer in men. Some reproductive factors may be associated with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in women.

Identifying emerging mental illness utilizing search engine activity: A feasibility study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNTREATED PSYCHOSIS; HIGH-RISK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DURATION; DEPRESSION; NARRATIVES; INTERNET; PRODROME; COHORTS; SLEEP	Mental illness often emerges during the formative years of adolescence and young adult development and interferes with the establishment of healthy educational, vocational, and social foundations. Despite the severity of symptoms and decline in functioning, the time between illness onset and receiving appropriate care can be lengthy. A method by which to objectively identify early signs of emerging psychiatric symptoms could improve early intervention strategies. We analyzed a total of 405,523 search queries from 105 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD, N = 36), non-psychotic mood disorders (MD, N = 38) and healthy volunteers (HV, N = 31) utilizing one year's worth of data prior to the first psychiatric hospitalization. Across 52 weeks, we found significant differences in the timing (p<0.05) and frequency (p<0.001) of searches between individuals with SSD and MD compared to HV up to a year in advance of the first psychiatric hospitalization. We additionally identified significant linguistic differences in search content among the three groups including use of words related to sadness and perception, use of first and second person pronouns, and use of punctuation (allp<0.05). In the weeks before hospitalization, both participants with SSD and MD displayed significant shifts in search timing (p<0.05), and participants with SSD displayed significant shifts in search content (p<0.05). Our findings demonstrate promise for utilizing personal patterns of online search activity to inform clinical care.

It is now spreading in Italy as a host country for transcontinental migrants and becoming an emerging health problem. This anthropological action-research, as part of a wider medical project on Neglected Tropical Diseases, has the purpose of analyzing the sociocultural construction of CD and its representation in Bolivian people living in Rome as well as barriers, such as the stigma about the illness, to access the National Health Service for those potentially affected. Methods The ethnographic study was carried out from 2016 to 2018 by a medical anthropologist at the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (INMP) on 72 Bolivian migrants (47 women and 25 men) living in Rome. The study was carried out through: a territorial mapping of Bolivian networks and communities aimed at recruiting people, participant observation, and application of semi-structured and unstructured interviews. The interviews were hold in Spanish and proposed to all participants before or during medical examination, or during events organized by the Bolivian community in Rome. The interview consisted of 16 items and covered four macro areas: personal and migration history, health status, access to the Italian National Health Service and knowledge about CD; plus 5 items for those who received a diagnosis of Chagas Disease in Italy. Results The sociocultural construction and the deep stigma about the illness built by participants and their families could hinder both diagnosis and treatment. Institutional barriers also contributed to reduce adherence to screening tests: often, opening hours of the outpatient clinic were incompatible with participants' precarious employments. To guarantee participant's access to public health services and their adherence to the diagnostic protocol, we implemented a profound revision of our cultural and institutional approach to them. Conclusions The analysis evidenced the limitations of the conventional approach applied by the Italian National Health Service to this migrant community, such as the absence of socio-cultural and linguistics competences that can help understanding patients' perception and representation of the illness. The multidisciplinary approach instead-with clinicians using the ethnographic results to adjust their work to the participants' needs-was a successful attempt to ensure therapeutic alliance.

J	Mottaleb, KA; Mainuddin, M; Sonobe, T				Mottaleb, Khondoker Abdul; Mainuddin, Mohammed; Sonobe, Tetsushi			COVID-19 induced economic loss and ensuring food security for vulnerable groups: Policy implications from Bangladesh	PLOS ONE			English	Article								At present nearly half of the world's population is under some form of government restriction to curb the spread of COVID-19, an extremely contagious disease. In Bangladesh, in the wake of five deaths and 48 infections from COVID-19, between March 24 and May 30, 2020, the government imposed a nationwide lockdown. While this lockdown restricted the spread of COVID-19, in the absence of effective support, it can generate severe food and nutrition insecurity for daily wage-based workers. Of the 61 million employed labor force in Bangladesh, nearly 35% of them are paid on a daily basis. This study examines the food security and welfare impacts of the COVID-19 induced lockdown on daily wage workers both in the farm and nonfarm sectors in Bangladesh. Using information from more than 50,000 respondents complied with the 2016-17 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) in Bangladesh, this study estimates daily wage rates as Bangladesh Taka (BDT) 272.2 in the farm sector and BDT 361.5 in the nonfarm sector. Using the estimated daily wage earnings, this study estimates that a one-day complete lockdown generates a US$64.2 million equivalent economic loss only considering the wage loss of the daily wage workers. After estimating the daily per capita food expenditure separately for farm and nonfarm households, this study estimates a minimum compensation package for the daily wage-based farm and nonfarm households around the US $ 1 per day per household to ensure minimum food security for the daily wage-based worker households.

Associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and presence of MD in parents have been related with increased odds of MD in offspring. However, there is a lack of population-based research in this field. The aim of the present study was to examine together the relationship between the presence of MD in children, and the SES and presence of MD in their parents, in a whole of population data. A gender approach was undertaken aiming to discern how these variables influence children's mental health when related with the father and the mother. Using administrative individual data from the National Health System, a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. The entire children population aged 6 to 15 resident in Catalonia in 2017 was examined. A logistic regression model was performed. Low SES was associated with increased odds of children's MD. Offspring of a parent with MD were at more risk of presenting MD than offspring of parents without these problems. Although these associations were consistent for both boys and girls when looking at the father's or mother's SES and MDs, the mother's SES and MDs showed a higher association with the offspring's MDs than the father's. Lowest associations, found for boys when looking at the father's SES and MDs, were: OR of 1.21, 95%CI 1.16 to 1.27 for lowest SES, and OR of 1.66, 95%CI 1.61 to 1.70 for parental MDs. Children's familiar environment, which includes SES and mental health of parents, plays an important role in their mental health. Socially constructed gender roles interfere with SES and parent's MD.
