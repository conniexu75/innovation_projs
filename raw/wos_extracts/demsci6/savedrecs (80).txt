Species-informative SNP markers for characterising freshwater prawns of genus Macrobrachium in Cameroon	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DECAPODA PALAEMONIDAE; LITOPENAEUS-VANNAMEI; POPULATION; CRUSTACEA; RIVER; COMPONENT; ANCESTRY; PACKAGE	Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are now popular for a myriad of applications in animal and plant species including, ancestry assignment, conservation genetics, breeding, and traceability of animal products. The objective of this study was to develop a customized cost-effective SNP panel for genetic characterisation of Macrobrachium species in Cameroon. The SNPs identified in a previous characterization study were screened as viable candidates for the reduced panel. Starting from a full set of 1,814 SNPs, a total of 72 core SNPs were chosen using conventional approaches: allele frequency differentials, minor allele frequency profiles, and Wright's Fst statistics. The discriminatory power of reduced set of informative SNPs were then tested using the admixture analysis, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis of principal components. The panel of prioritised SNP markers (i.e., N = 72 SNPs) distinguished Macrobrachium species with 100% accuracy. However, large sample size is needed to identify more informative SNPs for discriminating genetically closely related species, including M. macrobrachion versus M. vollenhovenii and M. sollaudii versus M. dux. Overall, the findings in this study show that we can accurately characterise Macrobrachium using a small set of core SNPs which could be useful for this economically important species in Cameroon. Given the results obtained in this study, a larger independent validation sample set will be needed to confirm the discriminative capacity of this SNP panel for wider commercial and research applications.

J	Song, DK; Hong, YS; Sung, YA; Lee, H				Song, Do Kyeong; Hong, Young Sun; Sung, Yeon-Ah; Lee, Hyejin			Body mass index and stroke risk among patients with diabetes mellitus in Korea	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEART-DISEASE; MORTALITY; OBESITY; ADULTS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ASSOCIATION; PARADOX; MEN	Background Obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) are both associated with cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) and stroke risk among patients with DM in Korea since relatively few studies have analyzed this area in detail. Methods We analyzed a total of 56,051 DM patients aged > 30 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Cohort who had undergone at least one national health examination between 2002 and 2012. BMI scores were divided into six categories, while hazard ratios for stroke were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. Results Overall stroke risk was positively associated with BMI for both men and women. For ischemic stroke, the risk was positively associated with BMI in women. However, for me, only patients with the highest BMI were at increased risk compared with patients with a BMI of 20-22.4 kg/m(2). For hemorrhagic stroke, the risk was significantly associated with BMI with a U-shaped association in men. In women, only patients with the lowest BMI had an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke compared with patients that have a BMI of 20-22.4 kg/m(2). Conclusion BMI was positively associated with the overall risk of stroke among DM patients in Korea. The risk of ischemic stroke was higher in obese patients compared to overweight or normalweight patients. However, the risk of hemorrhagic stroke was higher in slimmer patients compared with overweight or obese patients.

The algorithm reflects the radiologists' subjective evaluation criteria according to the Korea institute for accreditation of medical imaging (KIAMI) guidelines, where it judges whether a scan range is beyond landmarks' criterion. The algorithm consists of three stages: deep learning-based landmark segmentation, rule-based logical operations, and overscan determination. A total of 210 cases from a single institution (internal data) and 50 cases from 47 institutions (external data) were utilized for performance evaluation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's kappa were used as evaluation metrics. Fisher's exact test was performed to present statistical significance for the overscan detectability, and univariate logistic regression analyses were performed for validation. Furthermore, an excessive effective dose was estimated by employing the amount of overscan and the absorbed dose to effective dose conversion factor. The algorithm presented AUROC values of 0.976 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.925-0.987) and 0.997 (95% CI: 0.800-0.999) for internal and external dataset, respectively. All metrics showed average performance scores greater than 90% in each evaluation dataset. The AI-assisted overscan decision and the radiologist's manual evaluation showed a statistically significance showing a p-value less than 0.001 in Fisher's exact test. In the logistic regression analysis, demographics (age and sex), data source, CT vendor, and slice thickness showed no statistical significance on the algorithm (each p-value > 0.05). Furthermore, the estimated excessive effective doses were 0.02 +/- 0.01 mSv and 0.03 +/- 0.05 mSv for each dataset, not a concern within slight deviations from an acceptable scan range. We hope that our proposed overscan decision algorithm enables the retrospective scan range monitoring in LDCT for lung cancer screening program, and follows an as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle.

J	Yu, YQ; Lin, C				Yu, Yongquan; Lin, Chao			Screw analysis and experimental study of spatial noncircular gear compound transmission	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DESIGN; MOTION; RATIO; TRAIN	Curve face gear pair and noncircular bevel gear pair are collectively referred to as spatial noncircular gear pair (SNCGP). Different from the traditional gear transmission with fixed shafts, spatial noncircular gear (SNCG) compound transmission can realize compound motion with variable transmission ratio between intersecting axes, and has a broad engineering application prospect. It includes two categories named speed reduction and speed increase. Based on the gear meshing theory, screw theory and calculus, a screw analysis method of SNCG compound transmission was proposed, which directly and comprehensively reflected the compound motion characteristics of rotation and axial movement. Firstly, a unified coordinate system was established. The screw geometric characteristics of compound motion were discussed, including instant screw axis, axode, pitch surface and its normal equidistant surface. The screw principle of compound motion was revealed. Then, according to this method, combined with the motion process of generator with different tooth profiles, the tooth surface of each SNCG was obtained. Finally, gear machining, tooth surface measurement, transmission ratio measurement and axial displacement measurement were carried out, which verified the correctness of this screw analysis method for SNCG compound transmission, and laid a foundation for further study and application.

Its potential therapeutic properties increases when used in tandem with complementary agents like bio-based materials. Therefore, the present study is the first to investigate the cytotoxicity of a highly valued medicinal plant, Moringa oleifera, on human Wharton's Jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJMSCs) and its effects on the cells' gene expression when used as a pre-treatment agent in vitro. M. oleifera leaves (MOL) were dried and subjected to UHPLC-QTOF/MS analysis, revealing several major compounds like apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin in the MOL, with various biological activities like antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. We then treated the hWJMSCs with MOL and noticed a dose-dependant inhibition on the cells' proliferation. RNA-sequencing was performed to explain the possible mechanism of action and revealed genes like PPP1R1C, SULT2B1, CDKN1A, mir-154 and CCNB1, whose expression patterns were closely associated with the negative cell cycle regulation and cell cycle arrest process. This is also evident from gene set enrichment analysis where the GO and KEGG terms for down-regulated pathways were closely related to the cell cycle regulation. The Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software further predicted the significant activation of (p < 0.05, z-score > 2) of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation pathway. The present study suggests that MOL exhibits an antiproliferative effect on hWJMSCs via cell cycle arrest and apoptotic pathways. We believe that this study provides an important baseline reference for future works involving MOL's potential to accompany MSCs for clinical works. Future works can take advantage of the cell's strong anti-cancer gene expression found in this study, and evaluate our MOL treatment on various cancer cell lines.

J	Kim, Y; Kim, MY				Kim, Yujeong; Kim, Mi Young			Factors affecting household disaster preparedness in South Korea	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; ANXIETY	This study examines current household disaster preparedness and identifies its predictors in South Korea. A structured online survey was administered to 1,243 participants quota-sampled by age and population from each administrative district. Based on the socio-ecological model, interpersonal factors (general characteristics, prior disaster experience, anxiety, dispositional optimism, perceived disaster risk, and disaster preparedness knowledge), institutional factor (front-line preparedness), community factor (community resilience), public policy factor (governmental preparedness), and household disaster preparedness were measured. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Bonferroni test, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression. The predictors of household disaster preparedness were occupation, economic status, prior disaster experience, anxiety, disaster preparedness knowledge, front-line preparedness, and community resilience. The most potent predictor of household disaster preparedness was community resilience. Our finding that community resilience, a community factor, has a greater impact on household disaster preparedness than personal factors calls for programs that promote such resilience. Further, continuous public education and campaigns are needed to increase public awareness of household disaster preparedness and to improve the public's competency to prepare for potential disasters. This study raises the need for community programs for residents to increase household disaster preparedness knowledge and improve their competencies related to disaster response. This study is significant in highlighting the importance of community factors in improving household disaster preparedness amid the need to prepare for various types of disasters.

OGG1 gene involved in base repair mechanism, for excision of 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) from DNA formed as a result of accumulation of ROS in cell. HPRT gene encode transferase enzymes involved in purine recycling mechanism. The main focus of the study was to evaluate the expression variation in HPRT, OGG1 gene expression, and DNA damage of industrial workers. Blood samples of 300 occupational workers were collected from welding, brick kiln, furniture, pesticide, and paint industry (n = 60/industry) to evaluate the expression variation in HPRT, OGG1 gene expression, and DNA damage in blood cells by comet assay along with age and gender matched 300 control individuals. Blood arsenic content was higher (P<0.001) in an industrial group compared to the control. OGG1 and HPRT expression were (P< 0.05) downregulated in exposed workers compared to controls. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between HPRT vs OGG1 (P< 0.0001) in exposed workers compared to controls. Altered expression of both genes was observed between workers with < 25years and > 25years of age as well as between workers with <10years and >10year exposure. Reduced expression (P<0.05) of both genes and a high extent of DNA damage was evident in exposed smokers compared to respective non-smokers. DNA fragmentation was higher (P< 0.05) in the furniture, welding and brick kiln group compared to control, and other industries. The present study suggests that altered expression of OGG1 and HPRT gene induce oxidative stress, showed a negative impact on the recycling of purines leading to DNA damage which increase the vulnerability of workers to carcinogenicity.

In particular, the pathogens that cause urinary tract infection (UTI) have been shown to generate different profiles of volatile organic compounds, thus enabling the discrimination of causative agents using an electronic nose. While past studies have performed data collection on either agar culture or jellified urine culture, this study measures the headspace volume of liquid urine culture samples. Evaporation of the liquid and the presence of background compounds during electronic nose (e-nose) device operation could introduce variability to the collected data. Therefore, a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for quantitating ethanol in the headspace of the urine samples. By leveraging the new method to characterize the sample stability during e-nose measurement, it was revealed that ethanol concentration dropped more than 15% after only three measurement cycles, which equal 30 minutes for this study. It was further shown that by using only data within the first three cycles, better accuracies for between-day classification were achieved, which was 73.7% and 97.0%, compared to using data from within the first nine cycles, which resulted in 65.0% and 81.1% accuracies. Therefore, the newly developed method provides better quality control for data collection, paving ways for the future establishment of a training data library for UTI.

J	Liu, WW; Zhang, HM; Zhang, HC; Lyu, TZ; Yuan, SW				Liu, Wenwei; Zhang, Huimin; Zhang, Haichen; Lyu, Tongzhou; Yuan, Suwei			Prevalence and associated factors of inappropriate hospital admissions and days of children in a secondary hospital in Shanghai, China	PLOS ONE			English	Article							APPROPRIATENESS EVALUATION PROTOCOL; STAY; UNIT	Background Although the appropriateness of hospital utilization of adults and the elderly in China was audited by several studies, the appropriateness of hospital use by children in Shanghai remains to be determined. This study aims to assess the level of inappropriate hospital admissions and hospital days, to detect factors associated with inappropriateness, and to elucidate reasons for inappropriateness. Methods A retrospective review of the records of 291 admissions and 1449 hospital days of children inpatients from a secondary hospital in Shanghai was performed by two reviewers using the Chinese version Pediatric Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (C-PAEP). Demographics, socio-economic characteristics, and other admission- or hospital stay-related information were collected and analyzed to determine factors associated with inappropriateness utilizing multivariate regression models. Results 38.5% (n = 112) of admissions and 9.5% (n = 137) of hospital days were categorized as inappropriate, according to the C-PAEP. Children who were non-Shanghai residents (p < 0.001), admitted through the emergency sector (p = 0.030), and/or received services in a surgical ward (p < 0.001) had a higher risk of being admitted inappropriately. Payment method (p = 0.006), service type (p < 0.001), comorbidity (p = 0.016), length of stay (p = 0.007), and appropriateness of admission (p < 0.001) were found to be associated with prevalence of inappropriate hospital days. Approximately three-fourths of the inappropriate admissions were premature admissions (75.9%, n = 85). The most frequent reasons for inappropriate hospital days were awaiting test results (34.3%, n = 47), awaiting surgery (19.7%, n = 27), awaiting test execution (10.9%, n = 15), and family unprepared for home care (10.9%, n = 15). Conclusions Although the extent of inappropriate hospital days was moderate compared with that found by previous investigations, the prevalence of inappropriateness of admission was considerable. To enhance the appropriateness of hospital care for children, interventions could be implemented according to the associated factors and identified causes.

Trajectory tracking and prediction of table tennis is an important technology for table tennis robots, and its estimation accuracy is also disturbed by non-Gaussian noise. In this paper, a novel Kalman filter, called minimum error entropy unscented Kalman filter (MEEUKF), is employed to estimate the motion trajectory of physical model of a table tennis. The simulation results show that the MEEUKF algorithm shows outstanding performance in tracking and predicting the trajectory of table tennis compared to some existing algorithms.
